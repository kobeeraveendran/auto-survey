concept pointer network for abstractive summarization wang gao huang and zhou school of computer science and technology beijing institute of technology beijing china beijing engineering research center of high volume language information processing and cloud computing applications edu cn t c o l c s c v v i x r a abstract a quality abstractive summary should not only copy salient source texts as summaries but should also tend to generate new conceptual words to express concrete details inspired by the popular pointer generator sequence sequence model this paper presents a concept pointer network for improving these aspects of abstractive summarization the network ages knowledge based context aware tualizations to derive an extended set of date concepts the model then points to the most appropriate choice using both the cept set and original source text this joint proach generates abstractive summaries with higher level semantic concepts the ing model is also optimized in a way that adapts to different data which is based on a novel method of distantly supervised learning guided by reference summaries and testing set overall the proposed approach provides tistically signicant improvements over eral state of the art models on both the and gigaword datasets a human ation of the model s abstractive abilities also supports the quality of the summaries duced within this framework introduction abstractive summarization abs has gained overwhelming success owing to a tremendous development of sequence to sequence model and its variants rush et al chopra et al paulus et al guo et al gao et al in tandem with els pointer generator was developed by see et al as a solution to tackle the rare words and out of vocabulary oov problem associated with generative based models the idea behind is to use attention as a pointer to determine the ability of generating a word from both a corresponding author figure only copies keyword from the source text while generates new concepts to convey the meaning ulary distribution and the source text pointer generator networks have also been extensively cepted by the abs community due to their cacy with long document summaries chen and bansal hsu et al title tion sun et al however the current power of abstractive marization falls short of their potential as the ample in figure shows a model with a pointer mechanism marked as the direct pointer is likely to merely copy parts of the original text to form a summary using keywords and phrases such as athletes conversely a more like summary would be based on one s own derstanding of the detail in the words expressed as higher level concepts drawn from world edge like using the word group to replace athletes and ofcials this indicates that a good summary should not simply copy original rial it should also generate new and even abstract concepts that reect high level semantics therefore a pointer generator network that solely considers the source material to generate a summary does not adequately satisfy the needs of high quality abstractive summarization we argue that concepts have a greater ability to press deeper meanings than verbatim words as such it is essential to explore the potential of ing concepts from world knowledge to assist with abstractive summarization our developed model not only points to informative source texts but also leverages conceptual words from human edge in the summaries it generates hence in this paper we propose a novel model based on a concept pointer generator that ages the generation of conceptual and abstract words as a hidden benet the model also viates the oov problems our model uses pointer network to capture the salient information from a source text and then employs another pointer to generalize the detailed words according to their upper level of expressions finally the output is also consistent with language model by the generator unique to our concept pointer is a set of concept candidates particular for a word that is drawn from a huge knowledge base the set of candidates adheres to a concept distribution where the probability of each concept being erated is linked to how strongly the candidate resents each word moreover the concept bution is iteratively updated to better explain the target word given the context of the source rial and inherent semantics in the texts hence the learned concept pointer points to the most suitable and expressive concepts or words the tion function is adaptive so as to cater for different datasets with distantly supervised training the network is then optimized end to end using forcement learning with the distant supervision strategy as a complement to further improve the summary overall the contributions of this paper are a novel concept pointer generator network that leverages context aware conceptualization and a concept pointer both of which are jointly tegrated into the generator to deliver tive and abstract oriented summaries a novel distant supervision training strategy that favors model adaptation and generalization which sults in performance that outperforms the accepted evaluation based reinforcement learning optimization on a test only dataset in terms of rouge metrics a statistical analysis of titative results and human evaluations from parative experiments with several state of the art models that shows the proposed method provides promising performance related work abstractive summarization supposedly digests and understands the source content and consequently the generated summaries are typically a zation of the wording that sometimes form new sentences historically abstractive tion has been performed through rule based tence selection dorr et al key tion extraction genest and lapalme tactic parsing bing et al and so on ever more recently models with attention have played a more dominant role in generating abstractive summaries rush et al chopra et al nallapati et al zhou et al extensions to the approach include an intra decoder attention paulus et al and coverage vectors see et al to decrease etition in phrasing copy mechanism gu et al has been integrated into these models to tackle oov problem zhou et al went on to propose which copies complete sequences from an input sentence to further tain the readability of the generated summary pointer mechanism vinyals et al has drawn much attention in text summarization see et al because this technique not only vides a potential solution for rare words and oov but also extends abstractive summarization in a exible way c elikyilmaz et al further pointer generator models can effectively adaptive to both extractor and abstractor networks chen and bansal and summaries can be erated by incorporating a pointer generator and multiple relevant tasks guo et al such as question or entailment generation or multiple source texts sun et al however work particularly targets the problem of the abstraction is rare abstract meaning resentation amr is used to transform a sentence into a concept graph then merge those similar concept nodes to form a new summary graph liu et al concepts are also incorporated as auxiliary features guo et al kryscinski et al and weber et al dene the number of new n grams as the primary criteria of abstractiveness this makes sense in most cases but we believe that abstraction means ing detailed content with higher level semantically related concepts which has motivated the opment of the model proposed in this paper the proposed model concept pointer generator neural abstractive summarization can be scribed as a generation process where a tial input is summarized into a shorter sequential output through a neural network suppose that the sequential input xi xn is a quence of n number of words and i is the index of the input the shorter i e summarized sequence of output is denoted as y yt ym with number of m words and t indicates a time step as figure shows our model consists of two sub modules an encoder decoder module and the proposed concept pointer generator ule encoder decoder framework this process is formulated as an encoder decoder framework that consists of an encoder and an attention equipped decoder we use a two layer bi directional lstm rnn encoder and one layer uni directional lstm rnn decoder along with attention mechanism h h h n and formally the encoder produces sequential den states as h n in the corresponding positions and the bi directional hi flst m each word xi in the sequence can be represented as a concatenation i e hi of the bi directional hidden states h i the decoder generates a target h i mary from a vocabulary distribution which is based on a context vector h t through the following process p t x h where st is the hidden state of the decoder at time step t and h t is the context vector at time step t w w are trainable parameters and sfm is short for softmax function the context vector h t is computed by a weighted sum of the hidden representations of the source text and the weight is denoted as the tion t i h t t ihi t i hhi w sst the softmax function normalizes the vector of a distribution over the input position and v w h w s are trainable parameters pointer networks use attention as a pointer to lect segments of the input as outputs vinyals et al as such a pointer network is a suitable mechanism for extracting salient tion while remaining exible enough to interface with a model for generating an abstractive summarization see et al our proposed model is essentially an upgrade to this tion that integrates a new concept pointer network within a unied framework context aware conceptualization understanding the instances of a word requires a taxonomic knowledge base that relates those words to a concept space in our model we use an isa taxonomy called the microsoft concept wang et al to serve this purpose for two reasons wang and wang first this graph provides a huge concept space with multi word terms that cover concepts of worldly facts as concepts instances relationships and second the relationships between concepts and entities are probabilistic as a measure of how strongly they are related moreover the bilities are trustworthy given they have been rived from evidence found in billions of webpages search log data and other existing taxonomies our model is data driven and therefore is more easily adaptable with probabilities all these acteristics make the microsoft concept graph a suitable choice for our model more detailed amples are available in appendix a the concept graph species the probability that each instance belongs to a concept c given a word we have a distribution over a set of related concepts yet this raises the question of how to identify a context appropriate concept for a word from the distributional set of candidate cepts for instance apple in the context of an ple is good for you health tends to be associated with the concept of fruit instead of company mally given a word xi in a training sentence a set of k concept candidates ci i is linked to the word from the knowledge base with distributional probabilities over the concepts i e i ck i microsoft concept graph was derived from probase project the public data can be downloaded via the provided api research microsoft com home api current version is mined from billions of web pages containing m unique concepts m unique entities and m isa relations figure the architecture of our model blue bar represents the attention distribution over the inputs purple bar represents the concept distribution over the inputs noted that this distribution can be sparse since not every word has its upper concept green bar represents the vocabulary distribution generated from component i p is to nd the most suitable concept updated context represented by the vector h equation at each time step t i the task i to t the t in in the case of generating summaries given dated contexts a weighted update of the tional concept candidates needs to be performed in the model the updated weight denoted as j i is estimated by a softmax classier that is jointly conditioned on the hidden representation of the word hi the context vectors h t and each of cept vectors j i h t i where j w is a trainable parameter and cj i is the vector of the jth concept candidate which is a representation of the input embeddings together with the concept probability from the existing knowledge base i and the updated weights based on the contexts j i a context aware conceptualized probability of jth concept for the word xi p c i j is nally estimated as i j i j p c i i ck where is a tunable parameter theoretically we will end up with a number of k relevant concepts for each word ci i with a bility distribution over the set which is learned as i j p i p c p c concept pointer generator the basic pointer generator network contains two sub modules one is the pointer network and the p c i k other is the generation network these two modules jointly determine the probabilities of the words in the nal generated summary the ation probability pgen for the generation network see et al is learned by pgen hh t w sst w bgen where is a sigmoid function for the pointer network our model consists of a pointer to the source text and a further concept pointer to the relevant concepts that have arisen from the source content these two separate ers are calculated as follows the rst pointer is taken based on the attention distribution t i over the source text the second concept pointer is erated over a concept distribution of the source text that is scaled element wise by the attention bution to train the model given the likelihood of each concept in the current context the updates could be performed in two ways in a hard assignment the concept that receives the highest score would be selected for the update i argmax p c c i a where a arg max j i j where a is the index of maximized generated weight based on the contexts and p i a is obtained by eqs in random selection each of the concept didates could be trained randomly to update the parameters i random p c c i j p c i where j represents the selected concept index considering the above baseline generation work and both the pointer networks our nal put distribution is pgen t i c i t i i wi w i wi w can be updated by where c i arg max or i c the difference between these two i random choices is demonstrated in the experiments tion objective learning basic mle the baseline objective is derived by ing the likelihood training for the eration given a reference summary y y for document the ing objective is to minimize the negative likelihood of the target word sequence y y lm le log p y t y evaluation based reinforcement learning rl similar to paulus et al policy gradient methods can directly optimize discrete target uation metrics such as rouge the basic idea is to explore new sequences and compare them to the best greedy baseline sequence once the baseline sequence y or sampled sequence ys are ated they are compared against the reference quence y to compute the rewards and respectively in the rl training stage two arate output candidates at each time step are duced ys is sampled from the probability tion p ys and y is the baseline output the training objective is then to minimize ys ys log p ys lrl it is noteworthy that the samples ys are selected from a wide range of vocabularies extended by all the concept candidates this strategy ensures that the model learns to generate sequences with higher rewards by better exploring a set of close concepts thus the combination of these two objectives yield improved task specic scores while ing a better language model lf inal lrl le where is a soft switch between the two objectives the model is pre trained with mle loss then switch to the nal loss distant supervision ds for model adaption our intuition is that if the summary document pairs are dissimilar to the testing set the model could be retrained to adapt to weaken the inuence of the dissimilarity on the nal loss the result would be a training model that better ts the cic testing data the challenge is that there are no explicit supervision labels to indicate whether the training set is close to the testing set so a new training paradigm is needed in answer to this need and also to provide end to end ity in the model we developed a simple approach for labeling summary document pairs by ing the kullback leibler kl divergence between each training reference summary and a set of ing documents in this way the training pairs are distantly labelled for training the model specically the representations of the ence summaries and the testing set are computed by summing all the involved word embeddings given a testing document xd l where n d and n d is the size of the testing corpus the based representation of one document is xd l where is the number of ment words involved the reference summary is represented by y t we malize these vectors through a softmax function to cater for kl calculation the model adaption with the distant labels is dened as y xd xd lds n d l lmle where dkl indicates the kl divergence tween y and xd l and is a constant ter that is tuned via adaption to the testing set the divergences are averaged within the testing set which indicates the overall distances between testing set and each of the reference document pairs in this way the samples in the training corpus are distantly annotated as either relevant or irrelevant for model adaption noting that the model is pre trained with the mle loss before switching to distantly supervised training experiments datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model we conducted training and ing on two popular datasets the rst was the glish gigaword fifth edition corpus parker et al we replicated the pre processing steps in rush et al to obtain the same ing testing data after pre processing the corpus contained about m sentence summary pairs as training set and k pairs as the development set once pairs with empty titles were removed the testing set numbered pairs the second dataset was only used for testing this dataset consists of document headline mary pairs where each document is paired with four reference summaries written by humans evaluation metrics we used rouge lin as the evaluation metric which measures the quality of a summary by computing the lapping lexical elements between the candidate summary and a reference summary following previous practice we assessed unigram bigram and rg l longest common quence lcs noted that the english testing set contains references of different lengths while the testing set xes the mary length to bytes training setups we initialize word dings with d vectors and ne tune them ing training concepts share the same embeddings with the words the vocabulary size was set to for both the source and target text the den state size was set to the vocabulary size is increased from around to cepts w t the different number k of concept candidates for each word note that the generated concepts with unks were subsequently deleted our code is available on github com wprojectsn codes and the vocabularies and candidate concepts are also cluded we trained our models on a single gtx tan gpu machine we used the adagrad mizer with a batch size of to minimize the loss the initial learning rate and the accumulator value were set to and respectively we used gradient clipping with a maximum gradient norm of at the time of decoding the summaries were produced through a beam search of size the hyper parameter settings were on and on word we trained our concept pointer generator for iterations yielded the best performance then took the optimization using rl rewards for rg l at k iterations on and at k iterations on gigaword we took the supervised training at k iterations on and at k iterations on gigaword baselines the following state of the art lines were used as comparators rush et al is a tuned abs model with tional features luong nmt luong et al is a two layer lstm encoder decoder elman chopra et al is a convolution coder and an elman rnn decoder with tion is two layer bilstm encoder and one layer lstm decoder equipped with lsent nallapati et al uses tention temporal attention to keep track of the past tive weights of the decoder and restrains the etition in later sequences seass zhou et al includes an additional selective gate to trol information ow from the encoder to the coder pointer generator see et al is an integrated pointer network and model we implemented this baseline without its coverage mechanism since this is not our focus baseline models also include two pointer generator based extensions guo et al li et al cgu lin et al sets a convolutional gated unit and self attention for global encoding results and analysis the following analysis focuses on investigating whether our model is rst able to generate stract and new concepts and second how the overall quality performs against the baselines quantitative analysis the results are presented in table we observe that our model outperformed all the strong of the art models on both datasets in all metrics in terms of the except for on gigaword pointer generator performance the improvements made by our concept pointer are statistically nicant p across all metrics rouge evaluation option is rouge evaluation option is oov and summary length oov is another major challenge for current abstractive table rouge evaluation results on the gigaword and rouge recall on test set the results with mark are taken from the corresponding papers underlined scores are the best without additional optimization

rization models although generating longer maries or less unks is not our focus our model still showed improvements in this regard table we counted the number of unks and all generated summary words and measured the portions in both testing sets the oov ages dropped from to on gigaword and from to on which demonstrates that our model is effective at viating oov problems this result also supports the superior of the concept pointer over the line pointer generator from the statistics we found that the summaries generated by our cept pointer averaged around words while the pointer generator summaries averaged words per summary on this shows the concept pointer is able to capture more salient content by generating relatively longer summaries abstractiveness according and bansal abstractiveness scores are puted as the percentage of novel n grams in to chen the generated summaries that are not included in the source documents as shown in table compared with human written summaries which receive the highest novelty in terms of abstractiveness our concept pointer generator achieves closest performance with human written summaries against this result demonstrates a further advantage of our model in producing new and abstract concepts our model is designed to improve semantic relevance and promote higher abstraction more generated summary examples can be found in appendix b the baseline analysis on training strategies to evaluate the relative impact of each training strategy with the model we tested different nations for comparison with each other and against the baselines context aware conceptualization to gate the impact of training with both the ber of concepts k and the concept update egy mentioned in eqs and we chose a table human evaluation scoring of three models in terms of abstraction and overall quality by human uators the higher the better the score range could be indicates the improvements from the baselines to the concept pointer are statistically signicant method pointer generator concept pointer abstraction overall quality has a noticeable effect when the testing set is stantially semantically different from the training set but provides less improvement than rl when the two are close from this analysis we conclude that the ds strategy is better for model adaption with abstractive summarization human evaluations to explore the correctness of our model using man judgment we conducted a manual tion with post graduate volunteers we ily used the following criteria to assess the ated summaries abstraction i e are the abstract concepts contained in the summary appropriate and overall quality i e is the summary readable informative relevant to conduct the uation we randomly selected examples from the duc testing set and asked the teers to subjectively assess the summaries each example consisted of an article and three maries i e a summary by the model the pointer generator model and our proposed cept pointer model the volunteers chose the best summaries for each of the articles according to the above criteria can be multiple choices viously the summaries were randomly shufed and the model used to produce each was unknown to prevent bias the scores for each model were ranked by how many times the volunteers chose a summary w t each criteria averaged by the ber of participants the results are presented in table which show that our model outperformed both the model and the pointer generator see et al in both criteria as a last step we manually inspect the maries generated by our model and some ples are presented in appendix b we found that the summaries were not as abstract as written summary would likely be the ing tendency of the model is still to copy segments of the source text and rearrange the phrases into gigaword c i random c i random gigaword c i arg max c i arg max figure rouge metrics on gigaword and w t a different number of concept dates updates were conducted by hard assignment i arg max and random selection c c i random ferent number of concept candidates i e k to for the context aware ization update strategy performance was fully evaluated with the three rouge metrics as shown in figure the results only vary slightly ing to the number of concepts with the random lection strategy eq as shown in figure and this indicates that a random strategy is not very sensitive to the number of extracted ics this is in part because the concept pointer may or may not be able to point to the correct cepts from multiple candidates while in figure and the optimum settings are clearly parent i e k on gigaword and k on overall the hard assignment strategy eq provided the best performance in practical terms while random selection eq performs stably with different settings training with ds vs rl as shown in ble our model with either a distant supervision strategy concept or reinforcement learning concept were both rior to the basic concept pointer generator on both datasets further the relative improvement of the concept over the concept ranged from to on but was inferior to concept on gigaword in comparing the results it is clear that ds training l a summary however the overall approach does produce more high level concepts with correct lations compared to the baselines which strates that our solution is a promising research rection to further pursue additionally the ated summaries are long uent and informative conclusion this paper presents a novel concept pointer ator model to improve the abstractive tion model and generate concept oriented maries we also propose a novel distant vision strategy for model adaption to different datasets both empirical and subjective ments show that our model makes a statistically signicant quality
