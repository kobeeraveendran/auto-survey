p e s r p h t a m v v i x r a expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicity based on double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method dmitriy f kuznetsov abstract the article is devoted to the expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of second multiplicity into the double series of products of standard gaussian random variables the proof of expansion is based on the application of double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method the results of the article can be applied to the numerical integration of ito stochastic dierential equations introduction let f p be a complete probability space let be a nondecreasing right continous family of algebras of f and let f t be a standard m dimensional wiener stochastic process which is ft measurable for any t i m of this process are independent consider an ito stochastic dierential equation sde in the integral form t we assume that the components i t ft t t xt d df t t t t rn b rn here xt is some n dimensional stochastic process satisfying to the equation the nonrandom functions a rn rnm guarantee the existence and uniqueness up to stochastic equivalence of a solution of the ito sde the second integral on the right hand side of is interpreted as an ito stochastic integral let be an n dimensional random variable which is measurable and m m denotes a mathematical expectation we assume that and ft it is well known that one of the eective approaches to the numerical integration of ito sdes is an approach based on the taylor ito and taylor stratonovich expansions moreover one of the most important features of such expansions is a presence in them of the so called iterated ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals which play the key role for solving the problem of numerical integration of ito sdes and have the following form are independent when t t mathematics subject classification keywords iterated stratonovich stochastic integral generalized multiple fourier series multiple fourier legendre series multiple trigonometric fourier series legendre polynomial approximation expansion iterated ito stochastic integral t zt zt d f kuznetsov j t t zt zt where every l k is a continuous nonrandom function at the interval t t for i m and ik m i z and z denote ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals respectively note that usually in applications the functions binomial form more precisely t ql l k and ik m in eective solution of the problem of combined mean square approximation for collections of iterated l k are equal to or have a l k and ik m in while stratonovich stochastic integrals of second multiplicity composes the subject of this article it is well known that the mean square approximation of the iterated ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals using multiple integral sums requires signicant computational costs since this approach implies the partitioning of the integration interval t t of the iterated stochastic integrals into parts t t plays the role of an integration step in numerical methods for solving ito sdes t is already a suciently small value since t more ecient approximation methods for the iterated stochastic integrals use fourier series and they do not require the interval t t to be subdivided into smaller parts one such method was proposed in and elaborated in this method which received widespread use is based on the karhunen loeve expansion of the brownian bridge process in the eigenfunctions of its covariance which form a complete orthonormal trigonometric basis in the space t note that in the more general and eective method the so called method of generalized multiple fourier series for the mean square approximation of the iterated ito stochastic integrals was proposed this method is based on the generalized multiple fourier series that converge in the sense of norm in hilbert space t where t k is the hypercube t t t k times and k is the multiplicity of the iterated ito stochastic integral the method of generalized multiple fourier series was developed in an important feature of the method of generalized multiple fourier series is that various complete orthonormal bases in the space t can be used the method proposed in admits only the trigonometric basis hence we can state the problem of comparing the eciency of using dierent complete orthonormal bases in the space t in the context of the numerical solution of ito sdes this problem has been solved in also see in particular in it was shown that the optimal system of basis functions in the framework of the numerical solution of ito sdes is the system of legendre polynomials that is why this article is devoted to the expansions of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals with multiplicity based on multiple fourier legendre series usage of fourier series with respect to the system of legendre polynomials for approximation of iterated stochastic integrals took place for the rst time in also see the results of see also convincingly testify that there is a doubtless relation between multiplier factor which is typical for stratonovich stochastic integral and included into the sum connecting stratonovich and ito stochastic integrals and the fact that in the point of nite discontinuity of piecewise smooth function its fourier series converges to the value in addition in expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals several theorems on expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals were formulated and proved as shown in these papers the nal formulas for expansions of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals are more compact than their analogues for iterated ito stochastic integrals this paper continues the study of the relationships between generalized multiple fourier series and iterated stochastic integrals we use the unifrom converging double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method for proof of theorem page a or theorem page moreover as shown below the conditions of these theorems can be weakened method of generalized multiple fourier series let us consider the approach to expansion of iterated ito stochastic integrals the so called method of generalized multiple fourier series suppose that every l k is a continuous nonrandom function at the interval t t dene the following function on the hypercube t t for tk t k otherwise and t suppose that the function is piecewise continuous in the hypercube t t at this situation it is t k is converging to is a complete orthonormal system of functions in the space t

standard gaussian random variables for various i or j if i fourier coecient t t which satises the condition j i m j cjk is the n is a partition of the interval j note that the condition of continuity of the functions j j can be weakened see another versions and generalizations of theorem can be found in in order to evaluate the signicance of theorem for practice we will demonstrate its transformed particular cases for k t i m x t i m x x t i m x x x expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals t i m x x jl t i m x x jl where is the indicator of the set a d f kuznetsov theorem on expansion of iterated stochastic stratonovich integrals in a number of works of the author theorem has been adapted for iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities to for example summing up the results of the above works we can formulate the following theorem theorem suppose that is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials or trigonometric functions in the space t at the same time is a continuously dierentiable function on t t and are twice continuously dierentiable functions on t t then j t i m m x x x x x p x p p x x j t i m m j t i m m j t i m m j t i m m where j t is dened by and are the same as in theorem l in another notations note that the proof of theorem for the case k based on the proof of the following equality t zt x where is dened by for k and legendre polynomials or trigonometric functions in the space t is a complete orthonormal system of according to the standard relation between ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals we can write w p with probability j t t t zt expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals from the other hand according to we obtain t i m i m x x x x x from we get the proof of theorem for the case k see based on multiple double fourier legendre series and analogous trigonometric fourier series see theorem this proof uses double integration by parts which leads to the requirement of double continuous dierentiability of the function at the interval t t in this article we formulate and prove the analogue of theorem for the case k theorem see below but under the weakened conditions the functions only one time continuously dierentiable at the interval t t at that we will use the uniform converging double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method for the proof of theorem see below not that the two another proofs of theorem were found in sect sect and sufficient conditions of uniform convergence of double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method let j be the legendre polynomial consider the function y dened for consider the double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method and corresponding y to the function y n m c ij y def lim n m x p x def i x c ij y c ij p where let us consider the generalization for the case of two variables of the theorem on equiconvergence for the fourier legendre series theorem let y and the function d f kuznetsov is integrable on the square moreover let y u v u y v where are bounded functions on the square then for all y the following equality is satised lim n m n m x p x c ij y arccosy f where f is a partial sum of the double trigonometric fourier series of the auxiliary function f sin cos cos p sin p the fourier coecient c rectangle ij has the form at that the convergence in is uniform on the for any from theorem for example follows that for all y the following equality is fullled n m lim n m x p x c ij y y and convergence in is uniform on the rectangle for any if the corresponding conditions of convergence of the double trigonometric fourier series of the auxiliary function are satised y note that theorem does not imply any conclusions on the behavior of the double fourier legendre series on the boundary of the square for each let us call the exact upper edge of the dierence in the set of all points t t which belong to the domain d as the module of continuity of the function t t in the k dimentional domain d k if the distance t between t and t satises the condition t t t expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals we will say that the function of k k variables f t t belongs to the holder class with the parameter t in the domain d if the module of continuity of the function t t in the domain d has the order means the value with the property lim const in zhizhiashvili l v proved that the rectangular sums of multiple trigonometric fourier series of the function of k variables in the hypercube t t k converge uniformly in the hypercube t t to this function if it belongs to the class t denition of the holder class with the parameter can be found in the well known mathematical analysis tutorials see for example for example the following theorem is correct theorem if the function xn is periodic with period with respect to each variable and belongs in rn to the holder class c for any then the rectangular partial sums of the multiple trigonometric fourier series of the function xn converge to this function uniformly in rn lemma let the function y satises to the following condition y f y where and y then the following inequality is fullled y where y has the form y p y and k proof first we assume that y in this case we have y y f y moreover d f kuznetsov not dicult to see that the last inequality follows from the obvious inequalities from we obtain y y y where k the cases y and at that the consideration begins from the inequalities y can be considered analogously to the case y y y y and y y y where lemma is proved expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals lemma and theorem imply that rectangular partial sums of the double trigonometric fourier series of the function y in the case of periodic continuation of the function y converge uniformly in the square to the function y this means that the equality holds main theorem theorem suppose that is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t moreover are continuously dierentiable functions on t t then for the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral j t df m t zt zt the following expansion j t i m x x that converges in the mean square sence is valid where the notations are the same as in theorem proof let us prove the equality t zt x where is dened by the formula for k and at that orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t is a complete consider the auxiliary function k t k k t l t t and prove that where l and by the lagrange formula for the functions and for the functions t at the interval min at the interval min t max t t we obtain max t k k t t t t t we have d f kuznetsov t t t t t t t or t t t t t t t t t by the lagrange formula for the functions at the interval min max we obtain the estimate t t t t t or t t t t or t t let us show that if t or t t then the following inequality is satised t t first consider the case t t for this case t t t t then and is satised for the case t t we obtain expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals t t t t then and also is satised from and we have t t t t t t t t t t t or t t t or t t t t or t t t t or t t t t from and we obtain let t t t t t t y t t where y then k k y y y t t t t inequality can be rewritten in the form where y and k y k y l x y y where l and y x y thus the function k y satises the conditions of lemma and hence for the function d f kuznetsov k the inequality is fullled due to the continuous dierentiability of the functions and at the interval we have k y in addition k c zx dydx c properties of the function k y y thus the conditions of theorem are fullled for the function k y note that the mentioned t t let us expand the function k into a multiple double fourier legendre series in the square also correct for the function k t t this series is summable by the method of rectangular sums pringsheim method i e k lim k t t x x zt zt t lim x x zt zt t t zt x x lim t t moreover the convergence of the series is uniform on the rectangle t t t t for any in particular we can choose in addition the series converges to k at any inner point of the square t t note that theorem do not answer the question on convergence of the series on a boundary of the square t t in obtaining we replaced the order of integrating in the second iterated integral expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals let us substitute into after that let us rewrite the limit on the right hand side of as two limits let us replace with with with and with in the second limit thus we get lim x x t t according to the above reasoning the equality holds uniformly on the interval t t for any additionally holds at each interior point of the interval t t lemma under the conditions of theorem the following limit exists where is dened by if i e lim n x t zt zt the proof of lemma will be given in sect let us x and integrate the equality at the interval t t convergence of the series we can swap the series and the integral due to the uniform lim t x x t taking into account lemma consider the equality for n t lim lim n t x n x zt t t zt zt lim n n x n lim x x d f kuznetsov where riemann integral and orthonormality of the functions for j t in obtaining we used the theorem on the mean value for the t t performing the passage to the limit lim in the equality we get t zt x thus to complete the proof of theorem it is necessary to prove lemma remark on the basis of it can be argued that the function k belongs to the holder class with parameter in t t hence by theorem this function can be expanded into the uniformly convergent double trigonometric fourier series on the square t t which summarized by pringsheim method this means that theorem will remain valid if in this theorem instead of the double fourier legendre series we consider the double trigonometric fourier series however the expansions of iterated stochastic integrals obtained by using the system of legendre polynomials are essentially simpler than their analogues obtained by using the trigonometric system of functions see sect about some properties of legendre polynomials for further consideration we will need some well known properties of legendre polynomials the complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t looks as follows j t t pj r t t t t j where is the legendre polynomial it is known that the legendre polynomial is represented for example as at the boundary points of the interval of orthogonality the legendre polynomials satisfy the following relations dxj j pj pj where relation of the legendre polynomial pj with derivatives of the legendre polynomials and is expressed by the following equality p p j the recurrent relation has the form expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals j j orthogonality of legendre polynomial to any polynomial of lesser degree we write in the following form it follows that the orthonormal on the interval legendre polynomials determined by the relation from the property j if k j if k j p j j r it is well known that there is an estimate k j y j where constant k does not depends on y and j moreover pj j the christoel darboux formula has the form y n y n x proof of lemma to complete the proof of theorem let us prove lemma let us x n m n m n we have n n t x x zt s zt d f kuznetsov n t t x n x n x t t t t t t n x t t zy n t x n x zy t t where are derivatives of the functions with respect to the variable see applying the estimate and taking into account the boundedness of the functions and their derivatives we nally obtain n x n x n m dx zy dx dy expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals n n m x if n m where constants do not depend on n and m the relation completes the proof of lemma expansions of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of first and second multiplicity based on multiple fourier legendre series we will use the following notations for iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of and multiplicities i t df t t zt i t t t zt zt t df where ik m note that together with the iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of higher multiplicities than the second the stochastic integrals and are included in the so called unied taylor stratonovich expansion also see this expansion can be used for construction of strong numerical methods for ito sdes denition of a strong numerical method see for example in consider the expansions of some stochastic integrals and obtained by using theorem and formula i t t i t t i t t i t t t x i i i t t t i t t d f kuznetsov x i i i i i i i t t t i t t x i i i i i i p p p p i t t i t t t t x i i i i i i i i t t i t t t t x i i i i p i i i i t t i t t t t i i t t i i i x i p i p i where expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals i t t j df i i m t zt are independent standard gaussian random variables for various i or j note the simplicity of the formulas for comparison we present analogs of the formulas obtained in also see using the method proposed in i t t q i t t q p q r x q q r x q x where j functions in the space t and q q independent standard gaussian random variables m is dened by formula is a complete orthonormal system of trigonometric i m are r q another example of obvious advantage of the legendre polynomials over the trigonometric functions in the framework of the considered problem is the truncated expansion of the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral i t obtained by theorem in which instead of the double fourier legendre series is taken the double trigonometric fourier series which is acceptable according to remark q q q p x x r q q x q x i t t q p q q d f kuznetsov q x r q xr l q l r x where the meaning of notations included in is saved an analogue of the formula for the case of legendre polynomials is according to and the following representation where i t t t i t t q x i i i i i i p i t t t q x i i which is obviously substantially simpler than here it is necessary to pay a special attention on the fact that the representation includes a single sum with the upper summation limit q while the representation includes the double sum with the same summation limit in numerical simulation obviously the formula is more economical in terms of computational cost than its analogue there is another feature that should be noted in connection with the formula this formula was rst obtained in by the method from as we noted in sect the method of approximation of iterated stochastic integrals is based on the trigonometric series expansion of the brownian bridge process so this method leads to iterated application of the operation of limit transition in contrast to theorems and in which limit transition is performed only once this means that from the method generally speaking does not follow the mean square convergence of i t see to the stochastic integral i the same applies to some others approximations of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals obtained in by the method see discussion in sect for detail t if the validity of the formula expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals m lim q i t i t where i t is dened by the formula follows from theorems and theorems and from point of view of the wong zakai approximation s p the iterated ito stochastic integrals and solutions of ito sdes are complex and important s i m of the multidimensional wiener process fs i m suppose that converges onals from the independent components i s to f i t let n be some approximation of f i i m in some sense and has dierentiable sample trajectories a natural question arises if we replace f i s i m in the functionals mentioned above will the resulting functionals converge to the original functionals from the components i s i m of the multidimentional wiener process fs the answere to this question is negative in the general case however in the pioneering works of wong e and zakai m it was shown that under the special conditions and for some types of approximations of the wiener process the answere is armative with one peculiarity the convergence takes place to the iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals and solutions of stratonovich sdes and not to iterated ito stochastic integrals and solutions of ito sdes the piecewise linear approximation as well as the regularization by convolution relate the mentioned types of approximations of the wiener process the above approximation of stochastic integrals and solutions of sdes is often called the wong zakai approximation by f s s let fs s t be an m dimensional standard wiener process with independent components i s m it is well known that the following representation takes place i t x zt j j j j i s t zt t t where space t and j moreover the series converges for any is an arbitrary complete orthonormal system of functions in the are independent standard gaussian random variables for various i or j t t in the mean square sense be the mean square approximation of the process i which has the following let t i t from we obtain t j p x zt p x df j consider the following iterated riemann stieltjes integral form d f kuznetsov t zt zt p tk where ik m in dened by the relation and df let us substitute into df for i m d for i where t zt zt tk cjk jl p x j s t zt are independent standard gaussian random variables for various i or j in the case when i for i m and s i s s s cjk tk dtk t zt zt is the fourier coecient to best of our knowledge the approximations of the wiener process in the wong zakai approximation must satisfy fairly strong restrictions see denition pp moreover approximations of the wiener process that are similar to were not considered in also see theorems therefore the proof of analogs of theorems and for approximations of the wiener process based on its series expansion should be carried out separately thus the mean square convergence of the right hand side of to the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral does not follow from the results of the papers also see theorems from the other hand theorems and from this paper can be considered as the proof of the wong zakai approximation for the iterated riemann stieltjes integrals of multiplicities to based on the approximation of the wiener process in the form of its series expansion at that the mentioned riemann stieltjes integrals converge according to theorems and to the appropriate see and theorems stratonovich stochastic integrals recall that is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials or trigonometric functions in the space t to illustrate the above reasoning consider two examples for the case k m expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals the rst example relates to the piecewise linear approximation of the multidimensional wiener process these approximations were considered in let t t t be the piecewise linear approximation of the ith component i t with independent components i of the i t t multidimensional standard wiener process ft t m i e t k t k f i where note that w p f i k i i t k n t f i t k n consider the following iterated riemann stieltjes integral t s m using and additive property of riemann stieltjes integrals we can write w p t s t s d f d s zl f f ds n zl x zq x n f f l f f ds s zl zl f f l f f n x n using and it is not dicult to show that i m n t s df df s ds t s t d f kuznetsov df df s t s where relation where if n n t obviously agrees with theorem see p the next example relates to the approximation of the wiener process based on its series expansion is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials or for t where trigonometric functions in the space t consider the following iterated riemann stieltjes integral df df s m where df is dened by the relation let us substitute into t s t s df df s x p s t s d is the fourier coecient another notations are the same as in as we noted above approximations of the wiener process that are similar to were not considered in also see theorems in furthermore the extension of the results of theorems and to the case under consideration is not obvious however the authors of the works sect pp pp pp pp use the wong zakai approximation without rigorous proof within the frames of the approach based on the series expansion of the brownian bridge process on the other hand we can apply the theory built in chapters and of the monograph more precisely using theorems from this paper we obtain from the desired result i m df df s i m p p x t s df df s t s from the other hand by theorem see for the case k we obtain from the following expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals l i m df df s i m p t s i m p x x df df s t s p x x since x t x d d ds t t then from and we obtain references
