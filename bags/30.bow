hrebs and cohesion chains as similar tools for semantic text properties research doina mihaiela and epaminondas abstract in this study it is proven that the hrebs used in denotation analysis of texts and cohesion chains dened as a fusion between lexical chains and coreference chains represent similar linguistic tools this result gives us the possibility to extend to cohesion chains ccs some important indicators as for example the kernel of ccs the topicality of a cc text concentration diuseness and mean diuseness of the text let us mention that nowhere in the lexical chains or coreference chains literature these kinds of indicators are introduced and used since now similarly some applications of ccs in the study of a text as for example segmentation or summarization of a text could be realized starting from hrebs as an illustration of the similarity between hrebs and ccs a detailed analyze of the poem lacul by mihai eminescu is given introduction denotation analysis is a complex discipline concerned with the mutual ships of sentences an important tool used in denotation analysis is the concept of hreb dened in as a discontinuous text unit that can be presented in a set form or a list form when the order is important a hreb contains all entities denoting the same real entity or referring to one another in the text this basic concept is baptized in this way in honor of hebek who introduced measurement in the domain of denotation analysis as it is known in quantitative linguistics as we will show the concepts as lexical chain or coreference chain as in computational linguistics subsume the notion of hrebs in the variant of word hrebs in fact we are interested in this paper only in the notion of word hrebs for other kinds of hrebs morpheme hrebs phrase hrebs and sentence hrebs see we will operate with the concept of cohesion chain cc dened as a lexical chain or a coreference chain and will show the relationship between ccs and hrebs more exactly a slow modied kind of word hrebs quasi hrebs due to this relation some denotational properties of a text dened using hrebs could be translated to ccs in the benet of the last ones similarly some applications of ccs in the study of mathematics subject classication key words and phrases lexical chains coreference chains hrebs text segmentation text summarization babes bolyai university cluj napoca doina mihaiela and epaminondas a text as for example segmentation or summarization of a text could be realized starting from quasi hrebs the structure of the paper is as follows section presents the concept of hreb and some indicators of a text connected with it in section the lexical chains the coreference chains and their use in segmentation and summarization are introduced in section we analyze a poem by eminescu from the point of view of word hrebs as in and ccs the paper ends with some conclusions and further work proposal hrebs a word hreb contains all the words which are synonyms or refer to one of the synonyms the hrebs usually are constructed using some rules such that a word belongs to one or more hrebs for example a verb with personal ending and person belongs both to the given verb and to the person subject it overtly refer to we will slightly modify the denition of a hreb eliminating the above syntactical constraint and will denote the new concept by quasi hreb namely for us verbs with personal ending and person belong to the given verb and do nt have any connection with the hreb representing the subject of these verbs in this way a word belongs to only one quasi hreb similarly with the property that a word belongs to only one lexical chain or reference chain coherence chain the rest of the properties of hrebs mentioned in are unmodied for quasi hreb references belong to the quasi hreb of the word they refer to pronouns and named entities belong to the basic word synonyms constitute a common quasi hreb articles and prepositions are not considered adverbs may coincide with adjectives and may belong to the same quasi hreb according to the information and ordering of entities denes ve kinds of data hreb containing the raw data words and the position of each unit list hreb containing the data but without the positions of the units in the hrebs in text text set hreb being the set containing only the lemmas for word hrebs ordered set hreb is identical with but the units are ordered according to a certain principle alphabetically or according to length frequency ordered position hreb containing only the positions of units in the given text in our example in section we will use only the cases and complete word hreb analyses of several texts can be found in denotational analysis with hrebs creating hrebs means a reduction of the text to its fundamental semantic components having dened them one can make statements both about the text and the hrebs themselves and obtain new indicators a short introduction in these indicators is given below for a complete presentation see by lemmatizing the words occurring in a list hreb and eliminating the cates the corresponding set hreb is obtained if in a set hreb there are at least two hrebs and cohesion chains as similar tools for semantic text properties hrebi words dierent lemmas then the hreb belongs to the kernel core of the text kernel the hrebs of a kernel will be called kernel hrebs if an important indicator of a text is the size of the kernel denoted by topicality of a set kernel hreb hi is calculated as then hrebi kernel kernel concentration is dened as the size of the kernel divided by the total number n of hrebs in the text text concentration is calculated based on the list hrebs if hi is a list hreb containing all word forms not only lemmas and l is the number of tokens in the is the relative frequency of the list hreb hi text concentration text then pi t c is given as hi relative text concentration t crel is dened as hreb diuseness the diuseness dh of a given hreb h with nh elements where the positions of is dened using the maximal posnh tokens are in an ascending order p and minimal position of tokens occurring in it the dierence of the last and the rst position divided by the cardinal number of the hreb mean diuseness of the text is t hi hi kernel kc kernel n t c n x i t crel t c dh posnh nh dt ext dhj k k x c n l l where k is the number of kernel hrebs finally text compactness is dened as kernel in t ext where n is the number of hrebs in the text and l is the number of doina mihaiela and epaminondas cohesion chains lexical chains lexical chains lcs are sequences of words which are in a lexical cohesion relation with each other and they tend to indicate portions of a text that form semantic units the most frequent lexical cohesion relations are the synonymy and the repetition but could be also hypernyms hyponyms lexical cohesion relationships between the words of lcs are established using an auxiliary knowledge source such as a dictionary or a thesaurus a lexical chain could be formalized as lci i t okenj lcm i t okenk where the rst element of the chain lci is the word i representing the token with the number j in the text the last element of the chain lci is the word lcm i representing the token with the number k in the text where j k the length of the chain lci is because the analyze is made on the level of sentences usually the sentences where the words occur are indicated the representation in this case is lci i sj lcm i sk the rst element of the chain lci is the word sj the last element of the chain lci is the word lcm sk of the text where j k i and occurs in the sentence i and occurs in the sentence lcs could further serve as a basis for text segmentation and text summarization see the rst paper which used lcs manually built to indicate the structure of a text was that of morris and hirst and it relies on the hierarchical structure of roget s thesaurus to nd semantic relations between words since the chains are used to structure the text according to the attentional intentional theory of grosz and sidner theory their algorithm divides texts into segments which form cal structures each segment is represented by the span of a lc some algorithms for linear segmentation as opposite to hierarchical segmentation are given in in all these algorithms it is applied the following remark of hearst there are certain points at which there may be radical changes in space time character conguration event structure at points where all of these change in a maximal way an episode boundary is strongly present the algorithms are based on dierent ways of scoring the sentences of a text and then observing the graph of the score function in this paper we introduce two new scoring functions for sentences in the next subsection let us remark that linear segmentation and the extractive summarization are two interdependent goals good segmentation of a text could improve the tion moreover the rule of extracting sentences from the segments is decisive for the quality of the summary some largely applied strategies rules are the rst sentence of a segment is selected for each segment the sentence with a maximal score is considered the most important for this segment and hence it is selected for example the minima in the hrebs and cohesion chains as similar tools for semantic text properties graph of the below and functions represent the sentences candidates for boundaries between segments of a text from each segment the most informative sentence the least similar relative to the previously selected sentences is picked up thus one can say that determining a segmentation of a text and selecting a strategy or a summary of the text can be obtained as well coreference chains coreference chains are chains of antecedents anaphors of a text a complete study of coreference chains is the textbook a coreference chain contains the occurrences of the entities identied as antecedents for a given anaphor and also the occurrences of this anaphor the formalization of a coreference chain is as follows cri i t okenj crm i t okenk where j k or cri i sj crm i sk where j k depending on the marks tokens or sentences picked out in the same way as the lexical chains coreference chains express the cohesion of a text the algorithms of segmentation and summarization of a text based on lexical chains could be adapted for coreference chains in this paper we refer to both lexical chains and coreference chains by the name of cohesion chains scoring the sentences by cohesion chains cohesion chains ccs dened as in the above sections could be used to score the sentences such that when this score is low cohesion is low and thus the sentence is a candidate for a boundary between segments similarly for a high score a high cohesion and the non boundary feature of a sentence in this paper we propose the following two new functions of score for sentences the number of tokens in si contained in at least one cc the number of tokens in si let us remark that when or close to si is a candidate for a boundary between segments because si has a low connection with other sentences when or close to si is very internal for a segment so observing the graph of function we could determine the segments of a text the second proposed scoring function is the number of ccs which traverse si the total number of ccs in the text again and the above remarks remain valid when is or close to si is a candidate for a boundary between segments because si has a low connection with the others sentences when is or close to si is very internal for a segment doina mihaiela and epaminondas as a nal remark let us observe that the hrebs quasi hrebs could be used exactly in the same way to score the sentences it is enough to put quasi hrebs instead of ccs in the denitions for and thus hrebs quasi hrebs could serve to segment summarize texts in the same way the indicators used in denotational analysis with hrebs could be extended to ccs let us remark that quasi hrebs and thus ccs are dened in the data hrebs format this is accordingly with the denition of lexical chains where the most important frequent lexical relation which is present in a lexical chain is the repetition the more frequently a word is repeated in a lexical chain the more important this lexical chain is obtaining ccs from data hrebs duplicates are not eliminated we will impose the condition to a kernel cc to have at least a given number of elements in other words a kernel cc must contain a size bigger than a minimal one further the topicality of a kernel cc text concentration cc diuseness and mean diuseness of the text could be dened let us mention that nowhere in the lexical chains or coreference chains ture these kinds of indicators are introduced up to now example in romanian for the eminescu s poem lacul we will exemplify hrebs quasi hrebs and ccs and the relationships between them we will begin with the rules for hreb formation in romanian language rules of hrebs formation for the romanian language the rules for hrebs are of the form a here a is an expression containing a special element called pos indicator which is written in italic is for part of speech particularly a could be formed only from the pos indicator b is a name for a given hreb written with capital letters more exactly the rule a b means a or pos indicator of a is an element of the hreb b the connection between a and b will result from the word used for pos indicator as a word form could be contained in more then one hreb in the application of rules it is possible to obtain a result as a the rules are valid only for the pos of a being noun verb adjective adverb pronoun meaning a is an element of hreb b and hreb c and b c v erb rules verb personal ending of a verb which could be a noun or a pronoun synonym of a verb v erb pronoun referring to a noun pronoun referring to a named entity synonym of a named entity non referring pronoun noun synonym of a noun adjective adject iv e n am ed en t it y p ron ou n n am ed en t it y n ou n n ou n n ou n n ou n or p ron ou n hrebs and cohesion chains as similar tools for semantic text properties synonym of an adjective adverb adv erb of an adverb adv erb adject iv e the rules could be summarized as follows a noun its synonyms referring pronouns and personal endings in a verb belong all to the given noun a named entity its synonyms referring pronouns and personal endings in a verb belong all to the given named entity a verb in all its forms its synonyms belong to the given verb however the personal endings belong also to the respective noun an adjective adverb and its synonyms belong all to the given adjective adverb we illustrate the rules as applied to the poem lacul namely we will make a denotation of tokens in the poem then will extract hrebs table quasi hrebs table cohesion chains table the tokens numbered are only nouns verbs adjectives adverbs and pronouns in this poem do not exist named entities lacul denotation of tokens lacul codrilor albastru nuferi galbeni l n cercuri

hrebs to cohesion chains by the application of the above mentioned rules a total number of hrebs are obtained from all these only hrebs presented in table contain more than one element in table the hrebs are constituted as data hrebs where sdh means size of data hreb and ssh means size of set hreb the names of all hrebs are as follows a asculta a astepta a inc arca a c adea a cutremura a fosni a

the rule all these verbs are not present in table the table of quasi hrebs as a remark the hreb noi is not a quasi hreb because both elements sarim plutim are obtained by rule let us remember that lexical chains are sequences of words which are in a lexical cohesion relation synonymy repetition hypernymy hyponymy with each other coreference chains are chains of antecedents anaphors of a text

the hrebs and the length of a cohesion chain is given by the sdh column because the duplicates are not eliminated as in ssh column calculating the scores for each sentence are obtained the following results doina mihaiela and epaminondas taking as segment boundaries the sentences with minimal score the text is vided in segments or segments if mono sentence segments are not permitted scoring with formula the results are as following the text has only one segment with the most internal sentence a summary of the poem using is formed by the sentences and using by the sentence in both cases the rule one section has been applied indicators of cohesion chains let us suggest how the indicators in section could be dened for the cohesion chains to kernel ccs considering the minimal size of a kernel cc being all ccs are in kernel considering the minimal size of a kernel cc being only and are in kernel the last supposition is more realistic since a cc has always at least elements the size of the kernel is in the last above case topicality of the kernel cc denoted by is and topicality of is kernel concentration is kc pi to text concentration is t c and relative text concentration is t crel diuseness for each cc is as follows mean diuseness of the text is dt ext text compactness is c hrebs and cohesion chains as similar tools for semantic text properties the above indicators could make dierences between ccs such that some of them are kernel ccs or have a higher topicality diuseness conclusions and further work lexical chains and coreference chains ccs are intensively studied but few indicators are standard for them the indicators inspired from the hrebs must be studied and adopted for ccs these indicators in the context of some applications using ccs could become instruments for the evaluation of these applications and for improving them for example there is a large debate about how to select ccs to construct the summaries of a text selecting long or short ccs is one of the questions using only kernel ccs or kernel ccs with a high topicality and high diuseness could be a solution as a general remark quantitative linguistics and computational linguistics are considered two distinct elds with their own journals techniques and specialists it is important to identify those parts they have in common and to try to extract the advantage from this commonality
