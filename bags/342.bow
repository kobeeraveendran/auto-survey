summarizing text on any aspects a knowledge informed weakly supervised approach mellon university bowen lianhui eric p zhiting of washington cmu edu washington edu com inc san diego t c o l c s c v v i x r a abstract given a document and a target aspect e a topic of interest aspect based abstractive summarization attempts to generate a mary with respect to the aspect previous ies usually assume a small pre dened set of aspects and fall short of summarizing on other diverse topics in this work we study rizing on arbitrary aspects relevant to the ument which signicantly expands the cation of the task in practice due to the lack of supervision data we develop a new weak supervision construction method and an aspect modeling scheme both of which integrate rich external knowledge sources such as net and wikipedia experiments show our proach achieves performance boosts on marizing both real and synthetic documents given pre dened or arbitrary aspects introduction remarkable progresses have been made in ating generic summaries of documents nallapati et al see et al narayan et al partially due to the large amount of supervision data available in practice a document such as a news article or a medical report can span multiple topics or aspects to meet more specic mation need in applications such as personalized intelligent assistants it is often useful to rize a document with regard to a given aspect i e aspect based summarization recent research has explored the problem of aspect based abstractive summarization krishna and srinivasan frermann and klementiev a key challenge of the task is the lack of rect supervision data containing documents paired with multiple aspect based summaries previous studies have created synthetic data from generic and data available at tanyuqian aspect based summarization news summarization corpora which have a small set of aspects e sports health and other aspects in frermann and klementiev as a result models trained on these data tend to be restricted to the pre dened set and fall short of summarizing on other diverse aspects this paper aims to go beyond pre dened aspects and enable summarization on arbitrary aspects evant to the document the arbitrary aspect may not be explicitly mentioned but only implicitly lated to portions of the document and it can be a new aspect not seen during training to this end we develop a new approach that integrates rich external knowledge in both aspect modeling and weak supervision construction specically we derive weak supervisions from a generic rization corpus where the conceptnet knowledge graph speer et al is used to substantially pand the aspect scope and enrich the supervisions to assist summarization model to better understand an aspect especially a previously unseen one we augment the model inputs with rich aspect related information extracted from wikipedia our approach is compatible with any neural encoder decoder architectures in this work we use the large pre trained bart model lewis et al and ne tune with the proposed method periments on real news articles show our approach achieves performance boosts over existing methods when adapting to the previous synthetic domain the bart model after ne tuning with our weak supervisions becomes substantially more data cient and outperforms previous best performing systems greatly using only training examples

illustration of our approach left constructing weak supervisions using conceptnet including extracting aspects and synthesizing aspect based summaries right augmenting aspect information including identifying aspect related words in the document using wikipedia and feeding both aspect and related words into summarization model summaries of interest early work has studied aware summarization in the multi document ting with typically small datasets containing tiple documents tagged with a relevant topic dang conroy et al for single document aspect based summarization extractive methods were used to extract related key sentences words from the document lin and hovy our work studies abstractive aspect based tion that generates summaries deutsch and roth studied a sub task of learning to select formation in documents that should be included in the summary recent work frermann and tiev krishna and srinivasan on the problem synthesized training data that use news categories as the aspects and thus have a small pre dened set of aspects available we aim to able summarization on any aspects and develop new weak supervisions by integrating rich external knowledge aspect based summarization has also been plored in the customer reviews domain hu and liu where product aspects customer timent and sometimes textual summaries are tracted popescu and etzioni wang and ling angelidis and lapata query based summarization produces a summary in response to a natural language query question daum iii and marcu liu et al xie et al which differs from abstract aspects incorporating knowledge through weak sion has primarily been studied in classication or extraction problems hu et al peng et al ratner et al for example hu et al creates soft labels from a logical rule hanced teacher model to train neural classiers this work explores weak supervisions in the ation setting automatic creation of data sions also links our work to text data augmentation in either heuristic based wei and zou or automated manner sennrich et al hu et al this work embeds rich structured edge in the data synthesis process approach given a document and an aspect which can be a word or a phrase the task aims to generate a mary that concisely describes information in the document that is relevant to the aspect we present our approach that enables a neural summarization model to summarize on any aspects the aspect can be any words relevant to but not necessarily ring in the document our approach incorporates rich external knowledge sources including ceptnet for enriching weak supervisions in training sec and wikipedia for advising the aspect relation to improve comprehension sec figure shows an overview of our approach an advantage of our approach is that it is ible with any neural summarization architectures such as the popular encoder decoders this enables us to make use of the large pre trained network bart lewis et al on which we apply our approach for ne tuning and improved inference knowledge enriched weak supervisions usually no direct supervision data is available we start with a generic summarization corpus ically in this work we use the cnn dailymail hermann et al which consists of a set of document summary pairs our approach structs weakly supervised examples by cally extracting potential aspects and synthesizing aspect based summaries from the

dependent on bees for pollination summarization model inputoutputaspect u s words each resulting aspect and its aspect based summary are then paired with the document for training extracting aspects given a generic summary we want to extract as many aspects as possible so that the summarization model can see sufcient examples during training on the other hand the aspects must be relevant to the generic summary to facilitate synthesizing appropriate summary in the next step to this end we rst apply a named entity recognition ner to extract a set of entities mentioned in the generic summary these entities serve as a seed set of aspects we then augment the seed set by collecting each entity s neighbor concepts on the conceptnet knowledge graph as these concepts are semantically closely related to the entity and thus the generic summary for example in figure insect is a new pect from conceptnet given the seed entity bees synthesizing aspect based summaries for each aspect we synthesize a specic summary by extracting and concatenating all relevant sentences from the generic summary we make use of ceptnet in a similar way as above specically a sentence is considered relevant if it mentions the aspect or any of its neighbors on conceptnet the use of conceptnet greatly augments the supervisions in terms of both the richness of aspects and the informativeness of respective summaries knowledge aided aspect comprehension the summarization model is required to precisely locate information in the document that matches the desired aspect such comprehension and ing can be challenging especially with only noisy weak supervisions during training our approach facilitates the inference by informing the model with pre computed document aspect relations concretely we extract words from the document which are most related to the aspect more details below and feed those words into the model gether with the aspect and document in this way the model is advised which parts of the document are likely to be aspect related for the bart tecture we use an input format as where s is a special token for separation to determine the related words the intuition is that the words should be describing or be associated with the aspect we use the wikipedia page of the aspect for ltering the words besides we want io models xx to select only salient words in the document for a concise summary thus we rst rank all words in the document by tf idf scores and select top words that occur in the aspect s wikipedia experiments setup we construct weak supervisions from k out of k summary pairs in the training set of the cnn dailymail dataset mann et al we use the cnn pretrained bart lewis et al provided by fairseq ott et al as our base tion model and ne tune with our approach

introduced in frermann and klementiev although its aspects are restricted to only grained topics the synthetic domain facilitates tomatic evaluation providing a testbed for parison with the previous models and studying the generalization ability of our weak supervision approach when adapting to the new domain specically ma news is synthesized from cnn dailymail by interleaving paragraphs of inal documents belonging to different aspects the assembled document is paired with each nent s aspect and generic summary to form an aspect based summary instance the dataset has k examples in train dev test sets spectively and contains pre dened aspects cluding sport health travel news ence technology tv showbiz comparisons with previous methods we rst compare our approach with the previous rization

the model performs slightly better than sf more terestingly by further using only k ma news instances to continue ne tuning the model we achieve performance boosts compared to both sf and bart ma news

the methods we test on real news articles from the all the news corpus kaggle where we randomly extract articles from different lications other than cnn so that no articles are included in the weak

in an exclusive interview with breitbart news republican presidential nominee donald trump blasted bill clinton s suggestion that the united states use syrian refugees to rebuild detroit the populist billionaire denounced clinton s suggested proposal as crazy and unfair to american workers who are already living there and are in need of jobs it s very unfair to the people that are living there i think it s crazy trump told breitbart on thursday i mean these people there are plenty of people in detroit who you could almost look at as refugees carson said i mean we need to take care of our own people we need to create jobs for them clinton s suggestion that the u s ought to give detroit jobs to foreign refugees came during a february discussion at the clinton global initiative with chobani billionaire and mass migration enthusiast hamdi ulukaya the truth is that the big loser in this over the long run is a pretty good deal during the discussion clinton praised ulukaya for his efforts to ll his yogurt plants with imported foreign refugees ulukaya suggested that the u s ought to be taking in more refugees and said that he was proud of turkey s decision to accept million syrian refugees ulukaya told clinton that syrian refugees bring avors to the community just like in twin falls idaho where ulukaya s yogurt factory is based clinton s controversial suggestion that millions of more illegal immigrants thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness according to pew polling data hillary clinton s plan to expand immigration is opposed by at least percent of the american electorate voters whom clinton has suggested are racist for opposing immigration according to a september rasmussen survey percent black voters oppose clinton s refugee agenda to admit more than middle eastern refugees with less than one percent of black voters percent in favor of her refugee plan aspect donald trump summary presidential nominee donald trump calls suggestion that the u s

enthusiast hamdi ulukaya suggested that the u s should take in more refugees to ll jobs like in his yogurt plant in twin falls idaho where his factory is based aspect vote summary polls show that at least percent of the u s electorate is opposed to expanding immigration and that percent of black voters oppose the plan to admit more than middle eastern refugees to the country table generated summaries of a document on different aspects document content relevant to specic aspects is highlighted in respective colors related words identied through wikipedia sec are highlighted in bold as in previous work kryscinski et al ermann and klementiev the criteria include accuracy coherence between the aspect and the summary informativeness factual correctness and relevance of the summary with regard to the document and uency language quality of vidual sentences and the whole summary the pearson correlation coefcient of human scores is showing moderate inter rater agreement table shows the averaged scores and figure shows the proportions of model outputs receiving high scores in terms of the three criteria we can see our weakly supervised method performs best the model trained on the k ma news ples though performs well on the ma news test set table fails to generalize to the broader set of diverse aspects showing the importance of troducing rich knowledge in supervisions and ference process for generalization interestingly ne tuning our model with k ma news instances results in inferior performance showing the vious synthetic data with limited aspects could strict generalization to other aspects table shows example summaries by our weak sup model given an arbitrary aspect e an entity or a word the model correctly identies the related portions in the document and generates a relevant short summary it is also noticeable that our approach identies meaningful related words using wikipedia as described in sec which help with precise summarization conclusions this paper studies the new problem of summarizing a document on arbitrary relevant aspects to tackle the challenge of lacking supervised data we have developed a new knowledge informed weakly pervised method that leverages external knowledge bases the promising empirical results motivate us to explore further the integration of more nal knowledge and other rich forms of supervisions e constraints

that the big loser in this over the long run is going to be syria this i e the syrian migrant crisis is an enormous opportunity for americans clinton said in february detroit has empty structurally sound houses and lot of jobs are to be had repairing those houses detroit just came out of bankruptcy and the mayor s trying to do an innovative sort of urban homesteading program there but it just gives you an example of what could be done and i think any of us who have ever had any personal experience with either syrian americans or syrian refugees think it s a pretty good deal during the

clinton s controversial suggestion that u s give detroit jobs to imported foreign refugees has received virtually no media coverage outside of breitbart news during his wednesday immigration policy address trump challenged the media to begin asking hillary clinton to explain her radical immigration platform the media needs to begin demanding to hear hillary clinton s answer on how her policies will affect americans and their security these are matters of for our country and its people and we deserve answers from hillary clinton what we do know despite the total lack of media curiosity is that hillary clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement the result will be millions of more illegal immigrants thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness according to pew polling data hillary clinton s plan to expand immigration is opposed by at least percent of the american electorate voters whom clinton has suggested are

international criminal court on wednesday a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague in the netherlands where the court is based the palestinians signed the icc s founding rome statute in january when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem since june later that month the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis as members of the court palestinians may be subject to counter charges as well israel and the united states neither of which is an icc member opposed the palestinians efforts to join the body but palestinian foreign minister riad al malki speaking at wednesday s ceremony said it was a move toward greater justice as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice he said according to an icc news release indeed today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace judge kuniko ozaki a vice president of the icc said acceding to the treaty was just the rst step for the palestinians as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute these are substantive commitments which can not be taken lightly she said rights group human rights watch welcomed the development governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure and countries that support universal acceptance of the court s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership said balkees jarrah international justice counsel for the group what s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice not palestine s decision to join a treaty to which over countries around the world are members in january when the preliminary icc examination was opened israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage saying the court was overstepping its boundaries the united states also said it strongly disagreed with the court s decision as we have said repeatedly we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc the state department said in a statement it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said but the icc begs to differ with the denition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as palestine while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides prosecutor fatou bensouda said her ofce would conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than
