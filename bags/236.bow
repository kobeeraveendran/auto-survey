group extract and aggregate summarizing a large amount of finance news for forex movement prediction deli shuming keiko ruihan qi xu key lab of computational linguistics school of eecs peking university securities co ltd chendeli shumingma sukia edu cn keiko harimoto ruihan sc com t c o l c s c v v i x r a abstract information has incorporating related text proven successful in stock market prediction however it is a huge challenge to utilize texts in the enormous forex foreign currency change market because the associated texts are too redundant in this work we propose a bert based hierarchical aggregation model to summarize a large amount of nance news to predict forex movement we rstly group news from different aspects time topic and category then we extract the most crucial news in each group by the sota extractive summarization method finally we conduct interaction between the news and the trade data with attention to predict the forex ment the experimental results show that the category based method performs best among three grouping methods and outperforms all the baselines besides we study the inuence of essential news attributes category and gion by statistical analysis and summarize the inuence patterns for different currency pairs introduction deep learning and natural language processing technologies have been widely applied in market prediction tasks strau et al alostad and davulcu li et al ni et al and the market related nance news has proven very useful for the prediction ding et al xu and cohen however the studies of tion in forex market which is the largest market in the world with the highest daily trading volume is much less than that in the stock market ure shows the average numbers per hour of forex related news there is a large amount of nance news related to forex trading with different ence so it is a huge challenge to extract the useful semantic information from news most of ous works bakhach et al shen and liang this work is done when deli chen is a intern at mizuho securities figure average numbers per hour of forex related news from reuters in us eu represents news related to us europe or both of them pradeepkumar and ravi contreras et al weeraddana et al on forex diction ignore related text totally and focus on the forex trade data only which loses the important mantic information yet existing works seifollahi and shajari nassirtoussi et al ing nance news in forex prediction mainly rely on manual rules to build feature vectors which can hardly access the semantic information effectively to make better use of nance news we propose a novel neural model bert based hierarchical gregation model bham to summarize a large amount of nance news for forex movement diction we suppose that the nance news is dundant and only a small amount of news plays a crucial role in forex trading so the key point in is how to extract the most important news bham we design a hierarchical structure to tract essential news at the group level rst and then aggregate the semantic information across all groups we expect the news is more related group and less related inter groups to make the traction more effective we design three grouping methods from different aspects time topic or egory at the group level we concatenate news headlines in the same group and regard news traction in each group as an extractive tion task we modify the sota extractive marization model proposed in liu to select the most important news the connection process can let the selected news both content aware and context aware followingly we conduct modal interaction between news data and trade data through attention mechanism to predict the forex prediction the trade data represents the tory movement of the forex and the news data resents the environment variable these two types of information are highly related we conduct experiments on four major currency pairs usd eur usd jpy usd rmb gbp and the experimental results show that the category based bham performs best among all the baselines and proposed methods in all currency pairs based on this method we analyze the ence of input time and prediction time on forex trading we also analyze the inuence of news category and news region and nd various ence patterns for different currency pairs which may be enlightening to the forex investors the main contributions of this works are summarized as follows we design a novel neural model to rate nance news in forex movement tion to the best of our knowledge this is the rst work to use the neural model to rize a large amount of news for forex ment prediction we propose three news grouping methods from different aspects time topic and egory experiments show that the category based method performs best and outperforms all the baselines based on our experiments we study the fect of time parameters on forex trading we also analyze and summarize different ence patterns of nance news both category and region on different currency pairs related work bert devlin et al is a potent trained contextualized sentence representation and has proven obvious improvement for many nlp tasks sun et al xu et al liu proposes a modied bert for extractive rization and achieve the state of the art result in extractive document summarization task there have been many studies applying the lated text in market prediction tasks moreover the text assisted stock movement prediction has tracted many researchers interest most of these works predict stock movement based on single news si et al utilize the sentiment analysis to help the prediction duan et al adopt the summarization of news body instead of headline to predict ding et al propose the driven event embedding method to make the cast yet some others choose multi news hu et al propose a hybrid attention network to bine news in different days however the number of combined news is still limited and much smaller than that of forex news compared to stock prediction works about forex prediction is much scarce and most of these works al bakhach et al yong et al roledene et al contreras et al weeraddana et al do not consider the text information shen and liang employ stacked autoencoder to get the trade data representation and adopt support vector regression to predict de almeida et al combine svm with genetic algorithms to optimize investments in forex markets based on history price tsai et al choose the volutional neural network to process the trading data besides only limited works utilize the forex related text in the prediction process nassirtoussi et al adopt the wordnet miller and sentiwordnet baccianella et al to tract the text semantic and sentiment information and build the text feature vector to forecast forex movement following this work seifollahi and shajari add word sense disambiguation in the sentiment analysis of news headlines vijayan and potey apply the algorithm in alyzing text this kind of method pays more tention to access a xed feature vector from news and can only represent news on a shallow level in this work we propose a selection and aggregation neural framework to process the larger amount of nance news and employ the powerful pre trained bert as text encoder which can learn the deep semantic information effectively approach problem formulation each sample in the dataset y contains the set of news text the forex trade data y and the forex movement label and y happen in the same input time window to be more specic is a list of news groups l is the number of groups the methods for figure the overview of the proposed model figure the bert input in each news group data representation to predict the forex movement dividing groups are introduced in section each news group is a sequence of nance news in chronological der y is the trade data embedding accessed by the method introduced in section and is the forex movement label telling whether the forex trade price is up or down after a certain time we call it prediction delay the forex movement prediction task can be dened as assigning ment label for the news input and trade data input model overview the overview of the bert based hierarchical gregation model bham is displayed in ure the model can be generally divided into two steps group extraction and groups aggregation in the intra group extraction step news in the same group is connected as a continuous paragraph and we conduct extractive summarization on this paragraph to select the most important news specically we employ bert as the encoder to get the contextualized paragraph representation and compute the importance score for each news then we select and aggregate the top k k is a hyper parameters news to get the nal group representation in the inter groups gregation step we rst access the trade data sentation by a layer perceptron and then employ the trade data representation as a query to late the attention scores of all the news group and obtain the nal news representation finally we fuse the nal news representation and the trade intra group extraction there will be lots of news in the same group and we suppose that only a small amount of news has the greatest inuence on the forex movement the purpose of this step is to select the essential news from all news in group which is redundant and inspired by the bert based full of noise tractive summarization model proposed in liu we modify this method to select the most crucial news in each group all the news in the same group is related to the subject of this group and the connection of them in chronological order can be regarded as the continuous description of the group subject the connection can make the news representations realize the context tion of this group by passing information among different news we suppose the context tion can help select better news in group the form of group news input for bert coder is illustrated in figure we insert a cls token before each news and a sep token after each news for the segment embedding we use the loop of ea eb to extend the raw segment embedding of bert to multi sentences after the bert encoding all the cls tokens cls are garded as the semantic representations of the responding news the importance score for each multi layer score inputtrade data inputmovementpredictionfx news attentiongroup newstoken embeddingsposition embeddingssegment news is calculated base on these cls tokens scorei clsi ti where i l l is the number of groups clsi is the list of cls tokens in the th group and are the trainable parameters scorei is a list of values indicating the important scores of news topk is an operation to select the top k pieces of news with the highest scores then the group representation is calculated by the weighted sum of the top k cls tokens gi clsi j j the gi is the nal representation of the i th news group which contains the semantic information from the most important news in this group inter groups aggregation the purpose of this step is to aggregate semantic information at the inter groups level the forex trade data and the nance news are highly vant the trade data represents the history ment of forex and the nance news represents the environmental variable so the combination of them can help us model the forex movement ter in a certain input time news groups have ferent impacts on forex movement so we employ the trade data as a query to calculate the attention weights of news groups then the weighted sum of news groups and the trade data representation are nally fused to predict the forex movement for forex trade data we apply a layer tron to access the trade data representation rt and each layer is a non linear transform with relu tivation function then we calculate the attention weight between rt and gi wa atti where is the i th news group s attention weight to trade data then we sum the news groups representations up to get the nal news mantic representation rs to fuse the news semantic and trade data sentations effectively we choose the fusion tion used in wang et al mou et al to fuse rs and rt and predict the movement r rt rs rt rs rt rs y r bp means element wise multiplication methods of grouping news in this part we introduce the three news ing methods the ideal division enables news groups to be high cohesion and low coupling which means the semantic information of nance news should be highly related intra group and less related inter groups we suppose that extracting news by groups can reduce the extraction difculty compared to extracting from all news directly cause news in the same group is close to each other and has less noise moreover this method can help us analyze the contributions of different groups grouping by time in this method nance news is divided into groups according to the time when news happens we set the time unit to minutes and news released in the same time unit will be divided into the same group this method supposes that news happened closely is highly correlated grouping by topic in this method nance news is divided into groups by news topic the news topics are generated by unsupervised news clustering in this work we choose the afnity propagation algorithm frey and dueck to generate news clusters out setting the number of clusters subjectively moreover we choose the tf idf of gram features from news headlines this method supposes that nance news focuses on several nance event ics at a particular time news in the same topic describes this topic from different aspects and has a high correlation grouping by category in this method news is divided into groups are the news by category business sectors business general ness assets business commodities business affairs organizations rs gi atti l the reuters professional nancial news reuters com topic codes and merge some similar categories science technology other this method supposes that news in the same category is close to each other trade data embedding the raw record of forex data includes the close high low trade prices for each minute in der to extract all the possible features we build the trade data embedding y containing multi aspects raw number open close high low trade price for each trade minute change rate change rate of open high low price compared to last trade minute trade statistics mean value max value min value median variance of all the trade prices in input minutes the min max scale is applied for each currency pair s samples to scale the raw numbers in y to according to the maximum and minimum value of each feature training objective the loss function of the proposed model includes two parts the negative log likelihood training loss and the regularization item loss f log y is the model parameters experiments show that the performance improves after adding larization we train three models with different news grouping methods time topic and category and we call them bham time bham topic bham category respectively experiment dataset the experiment dataset is accessed from the fessional nance news providers we collect forex trade data of four major currency pairs usd eur usd jpy usd rmb gbp from to we collect the open close high low trade price for each trade minute as for the nance news data we collect all the english news happened in trade time leased by reuters and match the news with target currency pairs according to news region for ample we match usd eur with news related to us europe or both of them the raw data contains both news headline and body and we utilize the headline only since the headline contains the most valuable information and has less noise the forex movement label f is decided by the comparison of prediction time price and the input window ing price we design the symbol usd to represent the prediction for the usd eur exchange rate with minutes input time and minutes prediction delay to access more data for training we overlap the input time of samples for example when overlap rate is two utive samples input time will be am and am then the data samples will be twice as large as no overlap condition in the dataset the number of samples will increase from to we reserve samples for developing and samples for testing all the rest of samples are applied for training experiment setting we choose the pytorch pretrained as bert implement and choose the bert uncased version in which there are layers hidden states and attention heads in the former we truncate the bert input to tokens and ne tune the bert parameters during ing we adopt the adam kingma and ba optimizer with the initial learning rate of we apply the dropout srivastava et al ularization with the dropout probability of to reduce the batch size is the training epoch is with early stop the weight of regularization is the learning rate begins to decay after epoch the overlap rate of data samples is and the number of lected news in each group is when splitting the dataset we guarantee that the samples in train set are previous to samples in valid set and test set to avoid the possible information leakage we tune the hyper parameters on the development set and test model on the test set the forex prediction is conducted as a binary classication task up or down the evaluation metrics are macro and matthews correlation coefcient mcc mcc is often reported in stock movement forecast xu and cohen ding et al because it can overcome the data imbalance issue reuters news cthomson reuters crefinitiv com thomsonreuters com en html pytorch pretrained bert results and analysis comparison with baselines here we introduce the baselines in this work since there are few existing works we modify two advanced models from stock prediction eld which adopt multi news as input for this task sides we design some ablation variations of the proposed model to check the effects of different modules the baselines are shown below nonews this method considers the forex trade data only and use a layer perceptron the setting is same as full model to encode the trade data and make prediction this is a baseline to check the improvement by adding text information svm this method chooses the support tor machine to predict the result based on the feature vectors extracted by the method duced in seifollahi and shajari han this method is proposed in hu et al for stock movement prediction it includes a hybrid attention mechanism and gated recurrent unit to combine multi day s stock news to predict movement we use ery minutes instead of each day as time unit for this method and the stocknet method cause there is too much news for forex ing and the experiments show that the latest news has the most inuence stocknet this method is proposed in xu and cohen it treats the prediction task as a generation task and designs a variational auto encoder to process days tweets to predict stock movement nogroup this method does not group news and select key news directly from all news noconnect this method does not connect news in the same group instead it gets the representation for each news independently using bert this method groups news by category this method uses the directional lstm and self attention to place the bert as text encoder the ber of lstm hidden states is and the hidden layer is this method groups news by category as shown in table all the three proposed figure the bham category model s performances macro on usd jpy pair under different ditions of input time and prediction delay the dark colour means low performance and light colour means high performance methods perform well and both bham topic and bham category methods outperform all the baselines the bham category performs best among these methods which shows that the mantic information of nance news is mostly aggregated by category all the methods get improved after introducing the text information which proves the related nance news is helpful for the prediction the performance of nogroup method decreases by a large margin compared to bham category which demonstrates that the hierarchical structure works well without erarchical structure selecting essential news rectly from all news has more noise and requires the model to have a stronger tting ability for a longer paragraph after removing the news nection the performance of noconnect method drops sharply compared to bham category cessing the news representation from the nected paragraph helps the news representation alize the context information in the group the method performs worse than the bert based method which proves that bert has stronger power of sentence encoding the two methods borrowed from stock movement tion are designed to consider all news s mation but the forex related news is redundant which can explain the poor performance of these two methods effect of time parameters in this section we analyze the inuence of time parameters on model two crucial time and formance which are input method nonews svm han stocknet nogroup noconnect bham time bham topic bham category usd eur mcc usd jpy mcc usd rmb mcc usd gbp mcc table results of baselines and proposed methods on the test set input time window is minutes and prediction delay is minutes we observe similar result in other time settings all the experiment results have proven signicant with p by student t test time tion delay we choose the input minutes the prediction delay minutes and periment all combinations we take the jpy for example to analyze the time effect of forex trading and we observe similar results in other currency pairs the figure shows category model s performances macro on usd jpy pair under different combinations of put time and prediction delay we can observe that with the increase of input time from utes to minutes the model performance proves too however when we increase the input time continuously the model performance begins to decrease too less text is not enough to port the prediction but too many texts may bring much noise the ideal input time is around minutes besides at all input time conditions the model s performances decline with the increase of prediction delay because events happened in the prediction delay time may also inuence the forex movement we can also conclude that forex ment pays more attention to the latest news cause when masking the latest news input such as usd and usd the latter one can be seen as the former one masking the lastest minutes input the model performance declines obviously at almost all conditions inuence of news attributes in this section we analyze the inuence of nance news s attributes category and region on tion results and summarize the inuence patterns for different currency pairs we conduct the periments based on bham category effect of news category the forex trading data s attention weights over news categories are calculated by equation we sum up all the attention weights of test samples and calculate the proportions each category tributes as shown in figure we display the inuence patterns of news category for different currency pairs we observe that there are vious differences among currency pairs eur trading pays more attention to the business sectors and politics international affairs news usd jpy trading is mostly inuenced by ness sectors and science technology news itics international affairs news has the most nicant impact on usd rmb trading and ness commodities news effects usd gbp ing most the summarized inuence patterns can serve as decision making reference for forex traders when facing news from various categories effect of news region the trading data s attention weight for selected news attij is calculated by the following formula attij atti j where atti is the trade data s attention on the i th category in equation and j in equation is the weight of selected news in group we sum up all the selected news s attention according to their gions and access the region inuence weight the results are shown in figure for each currency pair the news are divided into three classes news related to region a only news related to region b only and news related to both region a and b and we observe that the news related to both region a and b has the least inuence on all currency figure the attention distributions over categories for different currency pairs figure the attention distributions over regions for different currency pairs usd eur usd jpy usd rmb usd gbp table impact of selection number in each group in bham category means keeping all news the sults have proven statistic signicant pairs news related to the us has the largest uence weight on usd jpy and usd gbp ing yet news related to china europe has a larger inuence weight than news related to us in rmb usd eup trading we can intuitively serve the inuence weights of different regions for forex trading which is helpful for the analysis and forecast of forex movement impact of selection number the selection number in each group is an tial hyper parameter to control the amount of tracted information as shown in table the bham category performs best when the tion number is in all currency pairs when the selection number is small the model is too strict so that some crucial information will be missed when the selection number is large some less inuential news will be selected and terfere model s decision when we keep all news in the group the model s performance declines by a large margin this experiment demonstrates that the selection mechanism plays an important role in the proposed model conclusion in this work we propose a bert based chical aggregation model to summarize a large amount of nance news for forex movement diction experiments show that our model forms all the baselines by a large margin which proves the effectiveness of the proposed work we design three grouping news ods time topic and category and experiments show that the category based method performs best which shows that the semantic information of forex related news is mostly aggregated by gory experiments about time effect prove that the proper input time is about minutes and the diction accuracy declines with the increase of diction delay besides we analyze the inuence of news attributes on forex trading and observe some interesting conclusions business sectors news has the most inuence on usd eur ing and politics international affairs news effects usd rmb trading most besides both jpy trading and usd gbp trading pay most tention to news from us all these inuence terns can help forex traders handle different news culture entertainment spotrsscience eur more wisely and make better decisions to our knowledge this is the rst work to lize the advanced nlp pre train technology in the enormous forex market and the results show the potential of this research area promising
