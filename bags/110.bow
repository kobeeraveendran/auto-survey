gold standard online debates summaries and first experiments towards automatic summarization of online debate data nattapong sanchan ahmet aker and kalina bontcheva natural language processing group department of computer science the university of shefeld portobello shefeld united kingdom abstract usage of online textual media is steadily increasing daily more and more news stories blog posts and scientic articles are added to the online umes these are all freely accessible and have been employed extensively in tiple research areas automatic text summarization information retrieval formation extraction meanwhile online debate forums have recently become popular but have remained largely unexplored for this reason there are no cient resources of annotated debate data available for conducting research in this genre in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic summarization task similar to extractive gold standard summary generation our data contains sentences worthy to include into a summary five human annotators performed this task inter annotator agreement based on semantic similarity is for cohen s kappa and for krippendorff s alpha moreover we also implement an extractive summarization system for online debates and discuss prominent features for the task of summarizing online debate data automatically keywords online debate summarization text summarization semantic larity information extraction sentence extraction introduction with the exponential growth of internet usage online users massively publish textual content on online media for instance a micro blogging website twitter allows users to post their content in characters length a popular social media like facebook allows users to interact and share content in their communities as known as friends an electronic commercial website amazon allows users to ask questions on their terested items and give reviews on their purchased products while these textual data have been broadly studied in various research areas automatic text tion information retrieval information extraction online debate domain which recently becomes popular among internet users has not yet largely explored for this reason there are no sufcient resources of annotated debate data available for ing research in this genre this motivates us to explore online debate data in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic tion task there are debate topics collected each topic consists of different number g u a l c s c v v i x r a gold standard online debates summaries of debate comments in total there are debate comments collected accounting for sentences in order to annotate online debate data we developed a web based system which simply runs on web browsers we designed the user interface for technical users when participants logged into the system a debate topic and a comment which is split to a list of consecutive sentences were shown at a time the annotators were asked to select salient sentences from each comment which summarize it the number of salient sentences chosen from each comment is controlled by a compression rate of which is automatically calculated by the web based system for instance table shows a debate comment to be annotated by an annotator based on the pression rate of the annotator needs to choose sentence that summarizes the comment this compression rate was also used in and in total we obtained sets of annotated debate data each set of data consists of comments with total annotated salient sentences inter annotator agreement in terms of cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha are and respectively for social media data such low agreements have been also reported by related work for instance reports kappa scores between and for human constructed newswire summaries reports again kappa scores between and for the conversation transcripts our agreement scores are based on strict conditions where agreement is achieved when annotators have selected exact the same sentences however such condition does not consider syntactically different sentences bearing the same semantic meaning thus we also experimented with a more relaxed version that is based on semantic similarity between sentences we regard two sentences as identical when their semantic similarity is above a threshold our results revealed that after applying such an approach the averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha increase to and respectively finally we report our results of automatic debate data summarization we mented an extractive text summarization system that extracts salience sentences from user comments among the features the most contributing ones are sentence position debate titles and cosine similarity of the debate title words and sentences the paper is structured as follows first we describe the nature of our online bate data in section we discuss the procedures of data annotation and discuss our experiments with semantic similarity applied on inter annotator agreement tion in section we present our rst results on automatically performing debate data summarization we conclude in section gold standard online debates summaries table examples of the debate data to be annotated task is global warming ctitious i do not think global warming is ctitious i understand a lot of people do not trust every source and they need solid proof however if you look around us the proof is everywhere it began when the seasons started getting harsh and the water levels were rising i do not need to go and see the ice caps melting to know the water levels are rising and the weather is changing i believe global warming is true and we should try and preserve as much of the earth as possible table examples of paraphrased arguments example propositions from the proponents global warming is real global warming is an undisputed scientic fact global warming is most denitely not a gment of anyone s imagination because the proof is all around us i believe that global warming is not ctitious based on the observational and comparative evidence that is currently presented to us example propositions from the opponents global warming is bull crap global warming is nt a problem at all just a way for the government to tax people on more things by saying their trying to save energy yes global warming is a myth because they have not really proven the science behind it online debate data and their nature the nature of online debate is different from other domains it gives opportunities to users to discuss ideological debates in which users can choose a stance of a debate express their opinions to support their stance and oppose other stances to conduct our experiments we collected debate data from the debate discussion the data are related to an issue of the existence of global warming in the data there are two main opposing sides of the arguments a side of proponents believes in the existence of global warming and the other side the opponents says that global warming is not true when the proponents and the opponents express their sentiments opinions and evidences to support their propositions the arguments between them arise moreover when the arguments are referred across the conversation in the forum they are gold standard online debates summaries quently paraphrased table illustrates examples of the arguments being paraphrased sentences expressing related meaning are written in different context annotation procedures in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic summarization task there are debate topics collected each topic consists of a different number of debate comments as shown in table the annotation was guided through a web based application the application was designed for non technical users when participants logged in to the system a debate topic and a comment which is split to a list of tences were shown at a time the annotators were given a guideline to read and select salient sentences that summarize the comments from each comment we allowed the participants to select only of the comment sentences these of the sentences are treated as the summary of the shown comment in the annotation task all comments in the debate topics were annotated we recruited participants males and participants to annotate salient sentences the participants backgrounds were those who are uent in english and aged above years old we aimed to have annotations sets for each debate topic due to a limited number of annotators and a long list of comments to be annotated in each debate topic participants were asked to complete more than one debate topic but were not allowed to annotate the same debate topics in which they had done before in total annotation sets were derived debate topics and each with annotation sets each annotation set consists of comments with total annotated salient table statistical information of the online debate corpus topic id debate topics comments sentences words is global warming a myth is global warming ctitious is the global climate change man made is global climate change man made is climate change man made do you believe in global warming does global warming exist can someone prove that climate change is real yes or fake no is global warming real is global warming true is global warming real yes or just a bunch of scientist going to extremes no average total this dataset can be downloaded at gold standard online debates summaries inter annotator agreement in order to compute inter annotator agreement between the annotators we calculated the averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha with a distant metric measuring agreement on set valued items metric masi the scores of averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha are and respectively according to the scale of our alpha did neither accomplish the reliability scale of nor the marginal scales between and likewise our cohen s kappa only achieved the agreement level of fair agreement as dened by however such low agreement scores are also reported by others who aimed creating gold standard summaries from news texts or conversational data our analysis shows that the low agreement is caused by different preferences of annotators in the selection of salient sentences as shown in table the sentences are syntactically different but bear the same semantic meaning in a summarization task with a compression threshold such situation causes the annotators to select one of the sentences but not all depending on each annotator s preference the selection leads to different set of salient sentences to address this we relaxed the agreement computation by treating sentences equal when they are semantically similar we outline details in the following section relaxed inter annotator agreement when an annotator selects a sentence other annotators might select other sentences expressing similar meaning in this experiment we aim to detect sentences that are semantically similar by applying from the gensim package model simultaneously learns the representation of words in sentences and the labels of the sentences the labels are numbers or chunks of text which are used to uniquely identify each sentence we used the debate data and a richer collections of sentences lated to climate change to train the model in total there are sentences used as the training set to measure how two sentences are semantically referring to the same content we used a function provided in the package to calculate cosine similarity scores among sentences a cosine similarity score of means that the two sentences are semantically equal and is when it is opposite the case in the experiment we manually investigated pairs of sentences at different threshold values and found that the approach is stable at the threshold level above the example below shows a pair of sentences obtained at level humans are emitting carbon from our cars planes and factories which is a heat trapping particle so there is no doubt that carbon is a heat trapping particle there is no doubt that our actions are emitting carbon into the air and there is no doubt that the amount of carbon is increasing in the pair the two sentences mention the same topic carbon emission and express the idea in the same context we used the threshold to re compute the gold standard online debates summaries agreement scores by applying the semantic approach the inter annotator agreement scores of cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha increase from to and from to respectively the inter annotator agreement results are illustrated in table note that in the calculation of the agreement we incremented the threshold by only particular thresholds are shown in the table due to the limited space table inter annotator agreement before and after applying the semantic similarity approach trial threshold before after automatic salient sentence selection support vector regression model in this experiment we work on extractive summarization problem and aim to select sentences that are deemed important or that summarize the information mentioned in debate comments additionally we aim to investigate the keys features which play the important roles in the summarization of the debate data we view this salient sentence selection as a regression task a regression score for each sentence is ranged between to it is derived by the number annotators selected that sentence divided by the ber of all annotators in this experiment a popular machine learning package which is available in python called scikit learn is used to build a support vector regression model we dened different features and the support vector regression model bines the features for scoring sentences in each debate comment from each comment sentences with the highest regression scores are considered the most salient ones feature denition gold standard online debates summaries sentence position sp sentence position correlates with the important tion in text in general humans are likely to mention the rst topic in the earlier sentence and they express more information about it in the later sentences we prove this claim by conducting a small experiment to investigate which tence positions frequently contain salient sentences from our annotated data the majority votes of the sentences are signicantly at the rst three positions imately shaping the assumption that the rst three sentences are considered as containing salient pieces of information equation shows the calculation of the score obtained by the sentence position feature sentence position if position otherwise sp debate titles tt in writing a writer tends to repeat the title words in a ment for this reason a sentence containing title words is likely to contain tant information we collected debate titles as shown in table in our iment a sentence is considered as important when it contains mutual words as in debate titles equation shows the calculation of the score by this feature t t number of title words in sentence number of words in debate titles sentence length sl sentence length also indicates the importance of sentence based on the assumption that either very short or very long sentences are unlikely to be included in the summary equation is used in the process of extracting salient sentences from debate comments sl number of words in a sentence number of words in the longest sentence conjunctive adverbs cj one possible feature that helps identify salient tence is to determine conjunctive adverbs in sentences conjunctive adverbs were proved that they support cohesive structure of writing for instance the tive adverb moreover has been used mostly in the essays which lead to a conclusion that it is one of the best accepted linkers in the academic writing process the nltk pos was used to determine conjunctive adverbs in our data cosine similarity cosine similarity has been used extensively in information trieval especially in the vector space model documents will be ranked according to the similarity of the given query equation illustrates the equation of cosine similarity where q and d are n dimensional vectors cosine similarity is one of our features that is used to nd similarity between two textual units the ing features are computed by applying cosine similarity gold standard online debates summaries n qidi n p i n i s p s p cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences cos tts for each sentence in debate comments we compute its cosine similarity score with the title words this is based on the assumption that a sentence containing title words is deemed as important cosine similarity of climate change terms and sentences cos ccts the climate change terms were collected from news media about climate change we calculate cosine similarity between the terms and sentences in total there are most frequent terms relating to location person organization and chemical compounds cosine similarity of topic signatures and sentences cos tps topic natures play an important role in automatic text summarization and information retrieval it helps identify the presence of complex concepts or the importance in text in a process of determining topic signatures words appearing ally in the input text but rarely in other text are considered as topic signatures they are determined by an automatic predened threshold which indicates scriptive information topic signatures are generated by comparing with classied text on the same topic using a concept of likelihood ratio presented by it is a statistical approach which calculates a likelihood of a word for each word in the input the likelihood of word occurrence is culated in pre classied text collection another likelihood values of the same word is calculated and compared in another out of topic collection the word on the topic text collection that has higher likelihood value than the out topic collection is regarded as topic signature of a topic otherwise the word is ignored semantic similarity of sentence and debate titles cos stt since the mentioned features do not semantically capture the meaning of context we create this feature for such purpose we compare each sentence to the list of debate tles based on the assumption that forum users are likely to repeat debate titles in their comments thus we compare each sentence to the titles and then calculate the semantic similarity score by using results in order to evaluate the system summaries against the reference summaries we apply rouge n evaluation metrics we report unigram bi grams and rouge skip bigram with maximum gap length of the rouge scores as gold standard online debates summaries table rouge scores after applying to the salient sentence selection rouge n cb r cj cos cct cos tts cos tps

indicate that sentence position feature outperforms other features the least performing feature is the cosine similarity of climate change terms and sentences feature to measure the statistical signicance of the rouge scores generated by the tures we calculated a pairwise wilcoxon signed rank test with bonferroni correction we report the signicance level of signicance after the correct is applied our results indicate that there is statistically signicance among the features table illustrates the statistical information of comparing sentence position and other features the star indicates that there is a statistical signicance difference between each parison pair conclusion in this paper we worked on an annotation task for a new annotated dataset online debate data we have manually collected reference summaries for comments given to global warming topics the data consists of comments with total annotated salient sentences we have performed ve annotation sets on this data so that in total we have x annotated salient sentences we also implemented an extractive text tion system on this debate data our results revealed that the key feature that plays the most important role in the selection salient sentences is sentence position other useful features are debate title words feature and cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences feature gold standard online debates summaries in future work we aim to investigate further features for the summarization poses we also plan to integrate stance information so that summaries with pro contra sides
