complex relation extraction challenges and opportunities haiyun qiaoben qiao deqing li and yanghua key laboratory of data science school of computer science fudan university china of data science fudan university shanghai china c e d l c s c v v i x r a abstract relation extraction aims to identify the target lations of entities in texts relation extraction is very important for knowledge base construction and text understanding traditional binary relation extraction including supervised semi supervised and distant supervised ones has been extensively studied and signicant results are achieved in cent years many complex relation extraction tasks i e the variants of simple binary relation tion are proposed to meet the complex applications in practice however there is no literature to fully investigate and summarize these complex relation extraction works so far in this paper we rst port the recent progress in traditional simple binary relation extraction then we summarize the ing complex relation extraction tasks and present the denition recent progress challenges and portunities for each task introduction relation extraction re is one of the fundamental tasks in information extraction and it benets a lot of natural guage processing tasks such as question answering text derstanding re is also a core step in the entire edge base construction pipeline traditional re tasks riedel et al aim to identify the correct relation between two entities from texts for ample we hope to extract the relational fact beijing capital of china from the following text beijing formerly romanized as peking is the capital of the people s republic of china traditional re tasks mainly focus on the binary relation tween two entities we refer to these tasks as binary relation extraction bire for short and they usually take based solutions according to the problem settings the ditional bire tasks are roughly divided into three categories supervised bire semi supervised bire distant supervised bire specically supervised bire focuses on the learning of a re model from a set of high quality labeled data however high quality labeled data is difcult and costly to be obtained while unlabeled data is widely available semi supervised bire thus is proposed to train models with only a small set of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data another effort to alleviate the difculty of data labeling is distant pervision distant supervised bire aims to learn a reliable re model based on a set of weakly labeled samples the bels are obtained automatically in a heuristic way and usually contain a lot of noises simple bires dominate the current research in information extraction in the early days feature engineering and based methods are the focus of the research in supervised and distant supervised bire bootstrapping was usually used in semi supervised bire where the relation instances and terns are iteratively extracted based on a small set of seed stances in recent years with the development of deep ing many advanced neural models e bert transformer capsule networks are applied to re tasks in general simple bire has made signicant progress and many effective solutions have been used in practice ever as intelligent applications fast grow simple bire not meet the needs of these applications we elaborate the limitations of simple bire and introduce more complex re tasks to solve these limitations first simple bire depends on large amounts of data however it is difcult to obtain enough labeled or unlabeled noisy data in many scenarios which fails existing supervised semi supervised distant supervised re models to solve this problem the task of few shot relation extraction was proposed which focuses on building effective models with just a few samples some few shot learning algorithms e metric learning based han and zhu are proven to be effective for this task second simple bire is limited to sentence level extraction simple bire mainly focuses on the relation between an tity pair mentioned in a single sentence instead many other sources beyond sentences contain more rich semantic relation instances how to extract relations from various sources is an interesting and challenging problem specically many entity pairs appear in multiple sentences in a ument which can not be extracted by simple bire els this motivates document level extraction most works on bire only focus on monolingual e g chinese or english but many entities are tioned in multiple languages indicating that it is ble to identify the relation using texts of different guages cross lingual relation extraction is thus posed in addition to texts other modal e image video formation is also useful for expressing certain tic relations for example image is good at expressing the spatial relations multi modal relation extraction is proposed to use multi modal information for re third binary modeling in bire is far from satisfying the requirements of some complex applications the ships of entities in the world are very complicated binary relation in general is not enough to model the complicated semantics of real world and more complicated relation eling is needed in some scenarios we have to identify the relations volving multiple entities i e n ary relation extraction n ary relation extraction aims to extract relations among n entities in the context of one or more sentences n ary re is very useful for document level reading hension and supportive for question answering or ment classication categorizing relations into different granularities is cial for some tasks such as building taxonomy multi grained relation extraction aims to jointly extract multi grained relations from texts many relational facts only hold true under certain ditions conditional relation extraction aims to extract relations with certain constrains e temporal or spatial conditions which are very important for complex cations for example we know the fact obama ident united states is only valid during if this fact is used for knowledge based question ing today it may have serious political implications some facts can be expressed in a nested way nested relation extraction is proposed to extract this kind of knowledge fourth the existing bire can not handle the overlapping entities well for another example the former sentence beijing formerly romanized as peking contains three facts beijing the capital of china beijing the same as peking and peking the capital of china however tional bire tends to extract these facts independently which losses much potential supervision information to model this property the task of overlapping re is proposed where one or two entities in two facts are overlapped in this paper we refer to the re tasks mentioned above as complex re the contents of this paper contain two parts the rst part sec presents the summary of the traditional bires besides the challenges and directions in bire are also concluded the second part sec introduces the plex re tasks including the denition example and the cent progress besides we also present the research lenges and opportunities for these complex re tasks we hope this survey will help researchers to understand the latest progress challenges and opportunities of the sub tasks in re binary relation extraction simple binary relation extraction bire has been extensively in general bire can be studied for many years rized into supervised semi supervised distant supervised paradigms supervised bire description supervised bire focuses on the learning of a re model based on a set of high quality labeled ples these samples are widely obtained by manual tation or careful crowdsourcing each sample is formalized as t st r where t is an entity pair st is a tence containing t and it expresses the labeled relation r a supervised bire model accepts t as inputs and predicts the proper relation r for entity pair t as the output recent works in recent years deep learning has been extensively used in re tasks and many novel neural models are proposed we highlight typical efforts in this direction neural graph based models graph based methods have been successfully applied to re and obtain high performance for example zhang and qi rst applied graph convolutional network gcn to re pre training based methods pre trained models e bert and xlnet can encode a given text into its proper distribution representation i e text zhao et al constructs entity pair graphs ding combined with the semantic features from bert capsule network based methods for example zhang et al takes capsule network with an attention based routing algorithm to deal with the label problem in re soat results the commonly used datasets in supervised bire include task ace and we present the state of the art results of task in table model macro tre r bert epgnn table the soat results on task all the results are from zhao et al semi supervised bire description in many scenarios rich labeled data is difcult to be obtained but a lot of unlabeled data is available to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data in the training stage semi supervised bire tries to learn from both labeled data and unlabeled data formally speaking we denote the pre dened set of and tions as r a set of labeled data as sl xi uib no public html ldc upenn edu stanford edu projects a set of unlabeled data as su where yi r and nl or nu is the corresponding data size semi supervised bire aims to learn a function f sl su r that models both the labeled and unlabeled data and predicts the target relation r for recent works as a main branch of semi supervised bire bootstrapping starts from some labeled seed instances and learn a preliminary model which is used to nd more labeled instances many works also focus on ing semantic drift problem in bootstrapping for example carlson et al adds constrains to the training dure by coupling many extractors for different categories and relations with the exploration of teacher student models in supervised learning luo et al introduces this tecture into semi supervised bire where students learn a bust representation from unlabeled data and teachers guide students with labeled data some other works also utilize multi task learning by jointly learning semi supervised bire task with other tasks soat results it is hard to fairly compare different supervised bire models this is because many strapping approaches are deployed in an open world setting and extract relations on the web semi supervised ting varies greatly between methods i e the level of vision the data size of unlabeled data and the evaluation rics can not be exactly the same in different methods for these reasons we do not provide the sota here in eral semi supervised bire has made great progress in recent years and many mature systems e dipre snowball and knowitall have been applied to some structured knowledge acquisition tasks in practice distant supervised bire description similar to supervised bire each sample in tant supervised bire can also be formalized as t st r the difference is that these samples are constructed in an matic way e aligning knowledge base with text corpora riedel et al the strong assumption in sample sition makes the samples in distant supervised bire contain lots of noisy relation labels in other words s may weakly or not express the labeled relation r as a result the main focus of research in distant supervised bire is how to alleviate the impact of noise on performance recent works we highlight several popular directions in recent years the idea of reinforcement learning has been widely used in noise detection for example sun et al takes policy network to detect the noisy labels and further to obtain the latent correct labels the adversarial training is also proven to be effective in improving the robustness of the re model on the noisy samples liu et al various attention mechanisms are also proposed to learn the important features or instances among the noisy ples li et al besides some other techniques are also applied to noise detection e soft constraints of entity types variant cnn non iid assumption noise label converter and so on soat results the commonly used benchmark for tant supervised bire is nyt riedel et al which is constructed by aligning triples in freebase with texts in new york times we report the soat results in table model att seg auc table the soat results on nyt where all the results are from li et al auc denotes the area under the precision recall curve challenges and directions of bire although simple bire has made great progress in recent years there are still some challenges reliability of benchmarks a reliable benchmark can be measured from two aspects scale and quality that is a good benchmark should contain large scale and quality test samples however the two conditions not be easy simultaneously satised in bire tasks for example in supervised bire the scale of the test set is usually very small how to obtain reliable benchmarks is a promising direction reliability of model learning because of the various factors limited data or noise the precise tic features of relations are still difcult to be captured with the development of machine learning technology e pre training transfer learning this problem can be alleviated to some extent but learning a highly reliable bire model is still an important direction sparse detection in applications in real applications we usually pre dene a set of relations r and then tract their instances from massive candidate entity pairs however there are countless semantic relations in the world and most of the candidate entity pairs to be cessed have no relation in r how to detect the correct instances from a huge collection is a big challenge and we refer to it as sparse detection fortunately there are some benchmarks to model this property for example nyt contains relation na that denotes there is no lation in the relation set but to the best of our edge there is no re model that performs very well on sparse detection complex relation extraction there are only very recent works around complex relation extraction core different from conventional bire core tries to extract more complex relations that involve ple entities or under certain constrains in this section we present the denition and investigate the recent progress for each complex re task we also conclude the challenges of each task few shot relation extraction in most cases a relation only has fewer instances which makes the traditional supervised re models powerless as a new paradigm few shot learning tends to be effective for this problem i e few shot re follows be han and zhu given a set of relations r with n relations a supporting set s is denoted as few shot re formalized can as s xn rn xn rn xn mn rn where r is the i th relation xi j is a sentence with an entity pair that is labeled with relation ri few shot re aims to learn a function f s r and predicts the proper relation y for the unlabeled sample learning algorithms on this dataset han and zhu proposes a new few shot re dataset fewrel they also implemented the recent soat shot fewrel gao et al is a more challenging few shot dataset which aims to study the problem of new domain tion under few instances considering the noise in shot re gao et al proposes a hybrid based prototypical network to extract informative features soares et al takes bert to learn the distributional similarity between two sentences where the entity pair in the sentence is replaced by a blank symbol there are two challenges or directions for few shot re relative importance of samples since there is only a few instances for each relation it is very necessary to learn from other relation instances when learning tic features of a target relation as a result the relative importance of an instance to the target relation should be learned otherwise the noise instance will be introduced is knowledge reasoning needed as han and zhu points out the relation diction in a large number of samples need deep reasoning beyond the text in the sample for example given the sentence han and zhu he was a professor at reed college where he taught steve jobs and replaced lloyd j reynolds as the head of the calligraphy gram the logical reasoning with common sense is needed to infer the relational fact steve jobs educated at reed college document relation extraction document relation extraction aims to extract relations in this task the tween entity mentions at document level relation mentions can span multiple sentences and even graphs these properties make the problem more challenging compared to intra sentence relation extraction in the real world case of re the data to be processed is ten in document form which requires re model of level or inter sentence rather than intra sentence until cently methods like song et al sahu et al pear and accelerate the development of inter sentence re tasks all of these methods can be used to enrich the edge base peng et al rst presents graph based lstm model to solve re in multiple sentences they build two rected acyclic graphs based on the word dependencies and then utilize lstm to learn the hidden presentations song et al further improves the model and introduce a graph state lstm model which can keep whole graph formation and has high efcacy in training and decoding sahu al uses ve type edges to build the steps document level graph and learn presentation by a labeled edge gcnn model bi afne layer aggregates all entity tions and generates the nal relation prediction the main difculties in document re are as follows diversity of document format the document can be in a variety of formats the rst task is to transform the original data le like pdf to the specic format like txt some important information can be lost in this step and make it harder to conduct re process long dependencies cross sentences relation mentions can span long distance in the document traditional cnn and rnn based networks fail to capture those tures in longer sequences cross lingual relation extraction cross lingual re seeks to learn an extractor trained in the resource rich language and transfers it to the target language the cross lingual re also takes the sentence as well as entity mentions as input and outputs the relation between the given entity pair cross lingual re is benecial to the knowledge base pletion because some entities may appear more frequently in corpus of a certain language considering the lack of annotated data it will inevitably lose a lot of informative facts that could not be extracted based on the resource poor guage cross lingual re can address this drawback exactly at an early age cross lingual re methods depend on parallel corpora and then conduct extraction by projecting et al the source language to the target one solves the problems with the help of translation nism when cross lingual word embedding was proposed ni and florian utilizes it to map source embeddings subburathinam et al rst builds text to the target features by universal dependency parsing tools and then adopts gcn to learn the hidden presentations in the shared semantic space in which the re of both languages can be conducted although there are many methods of cross lingual re main challenges are as follows gaps between languages the gaps between languages are quite different whether some shared features are useful universally is still a question applicable in practice the proposed state of the art models do not achieve the satisfactory outcome that the best performance of score is around due to the relatively low performance it is not reliable to use in practice multi modal relation extraction with the explosive growth of information from internet ages and videos also become rich resource multi modal re take the advantage of these large scale corpus and focus on extracting relations from them as a vivid way to convey information images and videos can implicate much knowledge on the one hand humans are like to express some common sense knowledge using images rather than explicitly saying it on the other hand ing multi modal corpus has shown promising results in many tasks this phenomena highlights the importance of ing relations from images or videos rather than just free text introduced a never ending image learner neil for visual knowledge from internet neil cluster images from websites and mining relationships tween instances based on recently proposed visual tion answering vqa datasets multi modal re like object or object attribute relations also aroused wide cern chen et al multi modal re is still a research hotspot and have many interesting problems to focus on generality of knowledge relation extracted by existing works is highly related to given input e the ball in the picture is red these knowledge is shallow and hard to be utilized in further study how to extract tive but informative relation e common sense edge is one of the ultimate goals of multi modal re multi modal kb although researches have begun to construct multi modal kbs there is still a big gap tween it and existing kbs n ary relation extraction n ary relation extraction nre aims to extract relations among n entities in the context of one or more sentences in the nre task the input can be denoted as e t where e en contains all the entity mentions and t sm is the given text containing m sentences m the target is to predict the relation among those n entities the relation set is pre dened and represented as r rk where na is also included in r noting there is no relation among the n entities for example given the text the deletion mutation on of egfr gene was present in patients while the point mutation on was noted in all patients were treated with getinib and showed a partial sponse peng et al the entity mentions egfr form the relation of drug gene mutation n ary re has attracted more research interests it plays a crucial role in applications such as detecting cause effect and predicting drug gene mutation facts in contrast to the prosperity of the binary re there are fewer methods posed for n ary re task mcdonald et al studies the case in biomedical domain where the n ary relation is pressed within a single sentence recently some exciting work song et al has appeared in the task of named entity recognition these methods can well handle the sentence n ary re peng et al explores a general re framework based on graph lstm they rst transform the text input to graph by regarding the words as nodes and the dependencies links between adjacent words and inter sentence relations as edges secondly the graph is separated into two dags from which they utilize an extended tree lstm network to learn the text presentations in the third step song et al propose a graph state lstm model that can learn better presentation of the input text during the recurrent graph state transition with increasing numbers of recurrent steps each word can capture more information from a larger context there is still some suffering in n ary re lack of data there is no well annotated data for ating n ary re specially the currently used benchmark dataset in peng et al and song et al is constructed based on distant supervision and has only one ternary relation absence of end to end model most of the preliminary works require all the entity mentions as input but taining them can be demanding in real applications an end to end model can make a vast difference multi grained relation extraction multi grained relation describes knowledge in a coarse ne manner intuitively ne grained relation aims to guish subordinate level relations from a coarse grained tion categorizing relations into different levels is crucial for building taxonomy mining level specic information the performance gains from multi grained information have been demonstrated in many tasks multi grained tions via categories can provide additional supervision from annotated data wu et al by learning multi grained topics of documents chen et al further improves the performance of short text classication however multi grained re attracted little attention from the community recently xia et al proposes a grained named entity recognition framework to tackle the overlapping and nested problem there are several possible reasons for the slow progress of multi grained re fuzzy boundary the boundary between coarse grained and ne grained relations is not clear existing works almost regard two type relations as a whole part which leads to a bottleneck of performance fairness of evaluation metrics the naive ment is not sufcient for multi grained re and sponding evaluation metrics are needed for better reect the quality in a multi grained manner conditional relation extraction conditional re aims to extract relations with certain strains temporal or spatial conditions a conditional lation can be generally denoted as s p o c where s p o overlapping relation extraction different relational triples in a sentence may have different zeng et al concludes two degree overlap ping types entity pair overlap epo and single entity overlap seo epo means some triplets share overlapping entity pairs seo means some triplets share an overlapped entity but they do nt share overlapped entity pair for ample president of and born in are seo which share the same entity born in and live in belong to epo which share the same entity pair the previous re was designed to nd relation based on given entity pairs however in actual applications the tion of entities is often unknown and there may be multiple relationships between entities ignoring overlapping re will lose many related triples leading to incomplete knowledge graphs some researchers are now studying how to consider lapping relations in a sentence copyr zeng et al adopts an end to end neural model with copy mechanism to extract overlapping relations which is the rst work ering overlap problems takanobu et al designs a erarchical paradigm which incorporates reinforcement ing to extract overlapping relations but there are still some challenges in overlapping ship extraction complexity of relations there may be no relationship or multiple relationships between two entities in a tence unknown entities and relationships the locations of entities and relationships are unknown and it is difcult to nd them correctly conclusion relation extraction denotes a series of tasks that aim to identify the proper relations for two or more entities der specic settings in this paper we summarize the est progress of simple binary re tasks including supervised semi supervised and distant supervised re furthermore we also investigate the more complex re tasks including the denition recent progress challenges and opportunities relationship extraction research is an eternal proposition which mainly benets from the advances in natural language processing and machine learning we argue that the existing progress made in simple bire can also be transferred to the complex re tasks mature applications for complex re are still far away we hope this survey make researchers quickly understand the concepts and research progress of each task in complex re is the original subject property object triple and c is the dition to hold relation true take temporal condition as an example the relation presidentof barack hussein obama american only holds true over the temporal period to so the condition can be a temporal interval here nowadays large scale kb contains millions of entity and relation instances such as dbpedia freebase and yago however few of them consider relation as conditioned or include the above mentioned external condition in the kb it heavily limits the applicability of existing kb to cated reasoning task and leads to an urgent need for research in conditional re in the early stage pattern based methods combined with manually designed features are adopted to capture the tion uses regular expressions to extract temporal and spatial relations from wikipedia infobox liu et al try to generate patterns for time variant relations some machine learning approaches are also tried in medical eld gurulingappa et al preliminary works have been attempted but there is still no good solution the main challenges are as follows complexity of dependencies the complex cies between entities relation and its condition make it hard to handle different part properly flexibility of condition condition in free text may have many existing forms a general framework is needed to formalize the conditional dimension lack of data there is no well annotated data for tional re yet to some extent it prevents using end end model for this task nested relation extraction traditional bire can be expressed as rel while nested re can be formalized as rel or rel however traditional nary re will lose some information resulting in incomplete and uninformative triples nested re helps to express the meaning of the original sentence more correctly in addition nested re will be more benecial to downstream tasks such as question answering that relies heavily on the correctness and completeness of triples some recent works try to study nested re nestie bhutani et al learns syntactic patterns for the lations that are expressed as nested templates stuffie prasojo et al exploits stanford dependency parsing and lexical databases to extract nested relations however the existing works are not good enough mainly because of the following challenges complexity of structure sentences consist of many clauses or there are many entities and nested ships sentence structure is often very complex and it is difcult to analyze nested structures directly implicit subject in a sentence the subject may appear only once most of which are in the form of a reference him he and the corresponding real entity needs to be found references bhutani et al nikita bhutani hv jagadish and dragomir radev
