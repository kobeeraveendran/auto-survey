sets baseline reader perceives content able generate summary tone appropriate reader important work implement maximal marginal relevance mmr based multi document text summarization propose nave model change tone summarization setting bias specific set words restricting words summarization output bias specified set words produces summary tone tone specified words keywords text summarization maximal marginal relevance tone bias introduction vast amounts information generated day automated text summarization represent vast information compact form techniques developed recent times improve accuracy summary provide summaries human like features sentences rank sentences included summary ranked sentences refined reordered form coherent summary feature based ranking means try improving query relevance sentences selected summarization turn increase redundancy summary query relevant sentences similar content work implemented maximal marginal relevance mmr based text multi document summarization sentence ranking considers novelty sentence reducing redundancy final summarization current summarization techniques try sure information content accurately represented summary summarization gives accurate representation data summarization nt human like daily life human summaries usually tend customized reader bias tone summarization propose nave model biasing tone summary

method use tf idf df use similarity measures like pearson s coefficient main objective work explore tone biasing evaluate nave approach c maximal marginal relevance maximal marginal relevance mmr technique tries reduce redundancy maintaining relevance query reordering sentences calculate relevance query sentences cosine similarity calculate similarity sentences remove similar sentences remove redundancy equation shows mmr explained subsection rank sentence terms best word query cosine similarity current sentence list n sentences s tunable parameter allows user tune mmr equation value ranges indicated maximum similarity indicates maximal diversity mmr works iteratively best possible redundant summary mmr process stops zero start varying observe best accuracy given dataset dataset performing text summarization d tone biasing discussed introduction propose nave approach biasing tone summary use textblob library python provides functions compute polarity sentences tag positive negative neutral polarity sentence calculated summing polarity words sentence textblob internally stemming lemmatization provide accurate polarity information use method analyze polarity sentence retrieved tf idf sentence ranking sentence negative polarity discard sentence finally sentences neutral positive polarity populated n list passed mmr results mmr producing positive summaries positive bias flip tone simply discarding positive polarity sentences instead negative polarity sentences polarity context sensitive referred abstractly paper needs explicitly defined users according use case users learn polarity words define tone according context tweaking classifiers assign polarity tags textblob ve developed nave approach exploring tone biasing approach approach sophisticated robust augmenting text summarization techniques polarity tagging techniques discuss approaches future work section iv applications system generated summaries generally consistent content accurate desirable properties quest summaries human like possible need bias summary according audience tone biasing lot applications text summaries modified convey message different flavor think applications tone biasing present examples censoring content graceful manner similar content displayed different age groups beneficial change tone summary accordingly apart adding removing sentences based polarity work natural language processing approach use similar words negativity replacement existing words improve polarity sentence required direction summarizing product service reviews summarize reviews positively critically different audiences positive summary provided prospective buyers critical summary provided backend teams feedback improve service extend approach having multiclass summary
