tone biased mmr text summarization chaudhari nelson mattukoyya graduate student computer science information systems pilani birla goa campus goa india abstract text summarization interesting area researchers develop new techniques provide human like summaries vast amounts information summarization techniques tend focus providing accurate representation content tone content ignored tone content sets baseline reader perceives content able generate summary tone appropriate reader important work implement maximal marginal relevance mmr based multi document text summarization propose nave model change tone summarization setting bias specific set words restricting words summarization output bias specified set words produces summary tone tone specified words keywords text summarization maximal marginal relevance tone bias introduction vast amounts information generated day automated text summarization represent vast information compact form techniques developed recent times improve accuracy summary provide summaries human like features sentences rank sentences included summary ranked sentences refined reordered form coherent summary feature based ranking means try improving query relevance sentences selected summarization turn increase redundancy summary query relevant sentences similar content work implemented maximal marginal relevance mmr based text multi document summarization sentence ranking considers novelty sentence reducing redundancy final summarization current summarization techniques try sure information content accurately represented summary summarization gives accurate representation data summarization human like daily life human summaries usually tend customized reader bias tone summarization propose nave model biasing tone summary set

preprocessing mmr fetch relevant sentences remove redundancy improve novelty content accurate novel text summary document tone summary reflects tone content bias tone generated summary proposed nave approach following subsections describe mentioned approach step step preprocessing firstly clean data set able run algorithms efficiently remove unwanted unnecessary data step scan documents remove stop words xml tags unnecessary processing sentences classified separate entities steps process text sentences lastly reduce words sentence stem word porter stemming algorithm sentence ranking idf values idf values relevance sentence respect query vector pick relevant sentences query vector generated finding frequent words document reflect subject document query vector based frequent words idf sentence ranking returns sentences close general summary document cosine similarity equation calculation idf given log weight word sentence tfi term frequency term frequency word sentence equation inverse document frequency idf number total sentences dfi document frequency number sentences contain word vary idf method use idf use similarity measures like pearson coefficient main objective work explore tone biasing evaluate nave approach maximal marginal relevance maximal marginal relevance mmr technique tries reduce redundancy maintaining relevance query reordering sentences calculate relevance query sentences cosine similarity calculate similarity sentences remove similar sentences remove redundancy equation shows mmr explained subsection rank sentence terms best word query cosine similarity current sentence list sentences tunable parameter allows user tune mmr equation value ranges indicated maximum similarity indicates maximal diversity mmr works iteratively best possible redundant summary mmr process stops zero start varying observe best accuracy given dataset dataset performing text summarization tone biasing discussed introduction propose nave approach biasing tone summary use textblob library python provides functions compute polarity sentences tag positive negative neutral polarity sentence calculated summing polarity words sentence textblob internally stemming lemmatization provide accurate polarity information use method analyze polarity sentence retrieved idf sentence ranking sentence negative polarity discard sentence finally sentences neutral positive polarity populated list passed mmr results mmr producing positive summaries positive bias flip tone simply discarding positive polarity sentences instead negative polarity sentences polarity context sensitive referred abstractly paper needs explicitly defined users according use case users learn polarity words define tone according context tweaking classifiers assign polarity tags textblob developed nave approach exploring tone biasing approach approach sophisticated robust augmenting text summarization techniques polarity tagging techniques discuss approaches future work section applications system generated summaries generally consistent content accurate desirable properties quest summaries human like possible need bias summary according audience tone biasing lot applications text summaries modified convey message different flavor think applications tone biasing present examples censoring content graceful manner similar content displayed different age groups beneficial change tone summary accordingly apart adding removing sentences based polarity work natural language processing approach use similar words negativity replacement existing words improve polarity sentence required direction summarizing product service reviews summarize reviews positively critically different audiences positive summary provided prospective buyers critical summary provided backend teams feedback improve service extend approach having multiclass summary instead negative positive summary multiple classes depend context subject documents trying summarize result

value impacted goes score precision total number correct words summary versus total words summary means summary length increases correct words included summary leads increase precision value figure polarity document clusters tone biasing figure plot comparing polarity sentences mmr nave tone biasing approach indicated blue color human summary tone bias dataset denoted red color mmr implemented summary chosen evaluation word length summary provided dataset documents negative polarity human summary mmr nave tone biasing successfully changes polarity documents positive polarity observe document clusters find negative polarity higher positive polarity indicates document high negative polarity converting document positive polarity meant dropping lot negative sentences results loss information conclusion future work observed mmr based multi document text summarization provides good accuracy superior approaches removing redundant information summary nave tone biasing approach works result information loss tones need high document loss information mitigated rephrasing sentences required tone instead discarding larger nlp problem future scope work area nave tone biasing
