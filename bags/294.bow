few shot learning for opinion summarization arthur mirella ivan university of edinburgh university of amsterdam ac uk mlap ed ac t c o g l s c v v i x r a abstract opinion summarization is the automatic ation of text reecting subjective information expressed in multiple documents such as user reviews of a product the task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention however due to the high cost of summary duction datasets large enough for training pervised models are lacking instead the task has been traditionally approached with tive methods that learn to select text fragments in an unsupervised or weakly supervised way recently it has been shown that abstractive summaries potentially more uent and better at reecting conicting information can also be produced in an unsupervised fashion ever these models not being exposed to actual summaries fail to capture their essential erties in this work we show that even a ful of summaries is sufcient to bootstrap eration of the summary text with all expected properties such as writing style ness uency and sentiment preservation we start by training a conditional transformer guage model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the product the model is also conditioned on review erties that are directly related to summaries the properties are derived from reviews with in the second stage we no manual effort ne tune a plug in module that learns to dict property values on a handful of summaries this lets us switch the generator to the rization mode we show on amazon and yelp datasets that our approach substantially forms previous extractive and abstractive ods in automatic and human evaluation introduction summarization of user opinions expressed in line resources such as blogs reviews social media or internet forums has drawn much attention due to its potential for various information access cations such as creating digests search and report gold ours reviews these shoes run true to size do a good job supporting the arch of the foot and are well suited for exercise they re good looking comfortable and the sole feels soft and cushioned overall they are a nice light weight pair of shoes and come in a variety of stylish colors these running shoes are great they t true to size and are very comfortable to run around in they are light weight and have great

wearing them running running shoes felt great right out of the box they run true to size my feet and feel like a dream tally light weight shoes run small more true to size t is great supports my arch very well they are lightweight usually wear a size women s ordered a and the t is great table example summaries produced by our system and an annotator colors encode its alignment to the input reviews the reviews are truncated and delimited with the symbol generation hu and liu medhat et al angelidis and lapata although signicant progress has been observed in supervised summarization in non subjective single document context such as news articles rush et al nallapati et al paulus et al see et al liu et al ern deep learning methods rely on large amounts of annotated data that are not readily available in the opinion summarization domain and expensive to produce a key obstacle making data annotation expensive is that annotators need to consider ple input texts when writing a summary which is time consuming moreover annotation would have to be undertaken for multiple domains as online views are inherently multi domain blitzer al and summarization systems can be sensitive isonuma et al this suggests that it is unlikely that human annotated corpora large enough for training deep models will be available recently a number of unsupervised tive multi document models were introduced e copycat brazinskas et al and meansum chu and liu that are trained on large tions of unannotated product reviews however unsurprisingly perhaps since the models are not exposed to the actual summaries they are unable to learn their key characteristics for instance sum chu and liu is prone to producing summaries that contain a signicant amount of formation that is unsupported by reviews cat generates summaries that are better aligned with reviews yet they are limited in detail over both systems are trained mostly on tively written reviews and as a result tend to erate summaries in the same writing style the main challenge in the absence of large tated corpora lies in successful utilization of scarce annotated resources unlike recent approaches to language model adaptation for abstractive document summarization hoang et al fel et al that utilize hundreds of thousands of summaries our two annotated datasets consist of only and annotated data points it was also observed that a naive ne tuning of multi million parameter models on small corpora leads to rapid and poor generalization vinyals et al finn et al in this light we propose a few shot learning framework and demonstrate that even a tiny number of annotated instances is sufcient to bootstrap generation of the formal mary text that is both informative and uent see table to the best of our knowledge this work is the rst few shot learning approach applied to summarization in our work we observe that reviews in a large unannotated collection vary a lot for example they differ in style the level of detail or how much they diverge from other reviews of the product in terms of content and overall sentiment we refer to vidual review characteristics and their relations to other reviews as properties ficler and goldberg while reviews span a large range of property values only a subset of them is appropriate for maries for example summaries should be close to the product s reviews in content avoid using the rst person pronouns and agree with the reviews in sentiment our approach starts with ing a property aware model on a large collection of reviews and then adapts the model using a few annotator created summaries effectively switching the generator to the summarization regime as we demonstrate in our experiments the summaries do not even have to come from the same domain more formally we estimate a text model on a dataset of reviews the generator is a former conditional language model clm that is trained with a leave one out objective besag brazinskas et al by attending to other reviews of the product we dene properties of unannotated data that are directly related to the end task of summarization those properties are easy to derive from reviews and no extra annotation fort is required the clm is conditioned on these properties in training the properties encode partial information about the target review that is being predicted we capitalize on that by ne tuning parts of the model jointly with a tiny plug in work on a handful of human written summaries the plug in network is trained to output property values that make the summaries likely under the trained clm the plug in has less than half a cent of the original model s parameters and thus is less prone to on small datasets theless it can successfully learn to control ics of a large clm by providing property values that force generation of summaries we shall refer to the model produced using the procedure as few shot summarizer fewsum we evaluate our model against both extractive and abstractive methods on amazon and yelp human created summaries summaries generated by our model are substantially better than those produced by competing methods as measured by automatic and human evaluation metrics on both datasets finally we show that it allows for cessful cross domain adaption our contributions can be summarized as follows we introduce the rst few shot learning work for abstractive opinion summarization simplicity we use the term product to refer to both amazon products and yelp businesses we demonstrate that the approach tially outperforms extractive and abstractive models both when measured with automatic metrics and in human evaluation we release datasets with abstractive maries for amazon products and yelp nesses unsupervised training user reviews about an entity e a product are naturally inter dependent for example knowing that most reviews are negative about a product s battery life it becomes more likely that the next review will also be negative about it to model inter dependencies yet to avoid intractabilities sociated with undirected graphical models koller and friedman we use the leave one out ting besag brazinskas et al specically we assume access to a large pus of user text reviews which are arranged as m groups n m where n are reviews about a particular product that are arranged as a get review ri and n source reviews ri rn our goal is to estimate the conditional distribution by optimizing the parameters as shown in eq arg max log i i m n m n m n m n arg max log i i our model has an encoder generator former architecture vaswani et al where the encoder e produces contextual representations of ri that are attended by the generator g which in turn is a conditional language model ing the target review ri estimated using forcing williams and zipser an tion is presented in fig the objective lets the model exploit common formation across reviews such as rare brand names or aspect mentions for example in fig the generator can directly attend to the word vacuum in the source reviews to increase its prediction bility additionally we condition on partial tion about the target review ri using an oracle the code and datasets are available at github com abrazinskas fewsum ri as shown in eq n m m n log i i i rj i we refer to this partial information as properties ficler and goldberg which correspond to text characteristics of ri or relations between ri and ri for example one such property can be the rouge score lin between ri and ri which indicates the degree of overlap between ri and ri in fig a high rouge value can signal to the generator to attend the word vacuum in the source reviews instead of predicting it based on language statistics intuitively while the model serves a wide distribution of rouge scores during training on reviews during summarization in test time we can achieve a high degree of input output text overlap by setting the property to a high value we considered properties that are listed below content coverage and rouge l scores between ri and ri signal to g how much to rely on syntactic information in ri during prediction of ri writing style as a proxy for formal and informal writing styles we compute pronoun counts and create a distribution over three points of view we also added an ditional class for cases with no pronouns see pendix for details and examples rating tion we compute the difference between the ri s rating and the average ri rating length deviation we similarly compute the difference between the ri s length and the average length of ri in terms of tokens novelty reduction while summary and review generation are cally similar there is an important difference that needs to be addressed reviews are often very diverse so when a review is predicted the erator often needs to predict content that is not present in source reviews on the other hand when a summary is predicted its semantic content ways matches the content of the source reviews to address this discrepancy in addition to using the rouge scores as was explained previously we introduce a novelty reduction technique which is similar to label smoothing pereyra et al specically we add a regularization term l scaled by that is applied to word distributions figure illustration of the fewsum model that uses the leave one out objective here predictions of the target review ri is performed by conditioning on the encoded source reviews i the generator attends the last encoder layer s output to extract common information in red additionally the generator has partial information about ri passed by the oracle r produced by the generator g as shown in eq m n m n log i i i rj i i i i rj i it penalizes assigning the probability mass to words not appearing in ri as shown in eq and thus steers towards generation of text that is more grounded in content of ri ri t ri i ri ri here t is the length of ri and the inner sum is over all words that do not appear in the word cabulary of ri intuitively in fig the penalty could reduce the probability of the word hoover to be predicted as it does not appear in the source reviews summary adaptation k once the unsupervised model is trained on reviews our task is to adapt it to generation of summaries here we assume access to a small number of annotator written summaries sk rk where s is a summary for n input reviews as we will show in sec naive ne tuning of the vised model on a handful of annotated data points leads to poor generalization instead we ize on the fact that the generator g has observed a wide range of property values associated with ri during the unsupervised training phase itively some combinations of property values drive it into generation of text that has qualities of a mary while others of a review however we might not know values in advance that are necessary for generation of summaries furthermore ri can not be applied at test time as it requires access to target texts in the following section we scribe a solution that switches the generator to the summarization mode relying only on input reviews plug in network we start by introducing a parametrized plug in work that yields the same types of erties as ri from a practical perspective the plug in should be input permutation invariant and allow for an arbitrary number of input reviews zaheer et al importantly the trainable plug in can have a marginal fraction of the main model s parameters which makes it less prone to when trained on small datasets we initialize the parameters of by matching its output to ri on the unannotated reviews specically we used a weighted combination of distances as shown for one group of reviews in eq n l here is a distance for the property l and l is an associated weight specically we used norm for content age rating and length deviations and leibler divergence for writing style for the plug in network we employed a very sturdy vacuum ri latexit ri latexit latexit ou latexit ou great vacuum rn latexit wczcevt rn latexit wczcevt encoder statesoracle this vacuumhooverproductgenerator attention layer feed forward network with multi head tion modules over the encoded states of the source reviews at each layer followed by a linear mation predicting property values note that the encoder is shared with the main model fine tuning unsurprisingly perhaps the network p being tialized on unannotated reviews inherits a strong bias towards outputting property values resulting in generation of reviews which should not be propriate for generating summaries fortunately due to the simplicity of the chosen properties it is possible to ne tune p to match the output of q on the annotated data sk rk n k an alternative is to optimize the plug in to rectly increase the likelihood of summaries under g while keeping all other parameters xed using eq as the generator is trained on unannotated views it might not encounter a sufcient amount of text that is written as a summary and that highly overlaps in content with the input reviews we dress that by unfreezing the attention module of g over input reviews and the plug in p and by maximizing the likelihood of summaries k k log n n this allows the system to learn an interaction tween g and p for example what property values are better associated with summaries and how g should better respond to them experimental setup dataset for training we used customer reviews from zon he and mcauley and yelp from the amazon reviews we selected categories tronics clothing shoes and jewelry home and kitchen health and personal care we used a ilar pre processing schema as in brazinskas et al details are presented in appendix for training we partitioned business product reviews to the groups of reviews by sampling without replacement thus for unsupervised training in sec we conditioned on reviews for each target review the data statistics are shown in table explored that option and observed that it works larly yet leads to a slightly worse result yelp com challenge dataset yelp amazon training validation table data statistics after pre processing the format in the cells is businesses reviews and ucts reviews for yelp and amazon respectively we obtained human written summaries for amazon and for yelp for reviews each using amazon mechanical turk amt each uct business received summaries and averaged rouge scores are reported in the following tions also we reserved approximately for ing and the rest for training and validation the details are in appendix experimental details for the main model we used the transformer tecture vaswani et al with trainable length embeddings and shared parameters between the coder and generator raffel et al subwords were obtained with bpe sennrich et al using merges subword embeddings were shared across the model as a form of regularization press and wolf for a fair comparison we approximately matched the number of parameters to copycat brazinskas et al we domly initialized all parameters with glorot rot and bengio for the plug in network we employed a multi layer feed forward network with multi head attention modules over encoded states of the source review after the last layer we performed a linear projection to compute property values further parameter optimization was formed using adam kingma and ba and beam search with n gram blocking paulus et al was applied to our model and copycat for summary generation all experiments were conducted on geforce rtx ti hyperparameters our parameter shared encoder generator model used a head and layer transformer stack dropout in sub layers and subword embeddings dropout was both set to and we used dimensional position wise feed forward neural works we set subword and length embeddings to and respectively and both were nated to be used as input for the plug in network we set the output dimension to and internal forward network hidden dimensions to we used a stack of layers and the attention modules with heads at each layer we applied internal dropout and attention dropout property values duced by the plug in or oracle were concatenated with subword and length embeddings and linearly projected before being passed to the generator in total our model had approximately m ters while the plug in network only k i e less than of the main model s parameters in all experiments the hyperparameter tuning was performed based on the rouge l score on yelp and amazon validation sets baselines lexrank erkan and radev is an vised extractive graph based algorithm selecting sentences based on graph centrality sentences resent nodes in a graph whose edges have weights denoting similarity computed with tf idf meansum is an unsupervised abstractive marization model chu and liu that treats a summary as a discrete latent state of an coder the model is trained in a multi task fashion with two objectives one for prediction of reviews and the other one for summary reviews alignment in the semantic space using the cosine similarity copycat is the state of the art unsupervised abstractive summarizer brazinskas et al that uses continuous latent representations to model review groups and individual review semantics it has an implicit mechanism for novelty reduction and uses a copy mechanism as is common in the summarization literature we also employed a number of simple tion baselines first the clustroid review was computed for each group of reviews as follows we took each review from a group and computed rouge l with respect to all other reviews the review with the highest rouge score was selected as the clustroid review second we sampled a random review from each group to be used as the summary third we constructed the summary by selecting the leading sentences lead from each review of a group evaluation results automatic evaluation we report rouge score lin based evaluation results on the amazon and yelp test sets in tables and tively the results indicate that our model forms abstractive and extractive methods on both table rouge scores on the amazon test set fewsum copycat meansum lexrank clustroid lead random fewsum copycat meansum lexrank clustroid

appendix for every criterion a system s score is computed as the percentage of times it was selected as best minus the percentage of times it was selected as worst orme the scores range from

baselines copycat is preferred over lexrank in terms of uency and non redundancy yet it shows worse results in terms of informativeness and overall sentiment preservation in the same vein on yelp in

tests the only exception is non redundency on yelp when comparing our model and copycat where our model shows a slightly lower score content support as was observed by falke et al tay et al brazinskas et al the rouge metric can be insensitive to lucinating facts and entities we also investigated how well generated text is supported by input views we split summaries generated by our model and copycat into sentences then for each mary sentence we hired amt workers to judge how well content of the sentence is supported by the reviews three following options were able full support all the content is reected in the reviews partial support only some content is reected in the reviews no support content is not reected in the reviews the results are presented in table despite not using the copy mechanism that is benecial for fact preservation falke et al and tion of more diverse and detailed summaries see appendix we score on par with copycat analysis alternative adaptation strategies we further explored alternative utilization proaches of annotated data points based on the same split of the amazon summaries as explained in sec first we trained a model in an pervised learning setting usl on the amazon views with the leave one out objective in eq in this setting the model has neither exposure to maries nor the properties as the oracle ri is not used further we considered two alternative settings how the pre trained unsupervised model can be adapted on the gold summaries in the rst setting the model is ne tuned by predicting maries conditioned on input reviews in the second one similar to hoang et al we performed adaptation in a multi tasking learning mtl fashion here usl is further trained on a mixture of unannotated review and gold summary batches with a trainable embedding dicating the task the results are presented in table first we observed that usl generates maries that get the worst rouge scores tionally the generated text tends to be informal and substantially shorter than an average summary we shall discuss that in sec second when the model is ne tuned on the gold summaries it noticeably improves the results yet they are substantially worse than of our proposed few shot approach it can be explained by strong inuence of the unannotated data stored in lions of parameters that requires more annotated data points to overrule finally we observed that mtl fails to decouple the tasks indicated by only a slight improvement over usl observed that the review summary proportion works the best fewsum mtl usl random rl table rouge scores on

unannotated data we further analyzed how plain ne tuning on maries differs from our approach in terms of turing summary characteristics for comparison we used usl and which are presented in sec additionally we analyzed unannotated reviews from the amazon training set specically we focused on text formality and the average word count difference len from the gold summaries in the amazon test set as a proxy for the former we computed the marginal distribution over points of view pov based on pronoun counts an ditional class nopr was allocated to cases of no pronouns the results are presented in table first we observed that the training reviews are largely informal and for and pov respectively unsurprisingly the model trained only on the reviews usl transfers a lar trait to the summaries that it generates on the contrary the gold summaries are largely formal indicated by a complete absence of the and a marginal amount of pov pronouns also an average review is substantially shorter than an age gold summary and consequently the generated summaries by usl are also shorter example maries are presented in table further we investigated how well adapts to the summary characteristics by being beam search attempting to nd the most likely didate sequence was utilized opposed to a random sequence sampling we observed that generated sequences had no cases of the pov pronouns and complete absence of pronouns nopr table example summaries produced by models with different adaptation approaches in domain cross domain domain cloth electronics health home avg table in and cross domain experiments on the zon dataset rouge l scores are reported tually ne tuned on them indeed we observed that starts to shift in the direction of the maries by reducing the pronouns of the pov and increasing the average summary length theless the gap is still wide which would probably require more data to be bridged finally we served that our approach adapts much better to the desired characteristics by producing well formed summary text that is also very close in length to the gold summaries cross domain we hypothesized that on a small dataset the model primarily learns course grained features such as common writing phrases and their correlations tween input reviews and summaries also that they in principle could be learned from remotely lated domains we investigated that by ne tuning the model on summaries that are not in the get domain of the amazon dataset specically pipeline framework for abstractive summary eration our conditioning on text properties proach is similar to ficler and goldberg yet we rely on automatically derived properties that associate a target to source and learn a separate module to generate their combinations moreover their method has not been studied in the context of summarization conclusions in this work we introduce the rst to our edge few shot framework for abstractive opinion summarization we show that it can efciently lize even a handful of annotated reviews summary pairs to train models that generate uent tive and overall sentiment reecting summaries we propose to exploit summary related properties in unannotated reviews that are used for vised training of a generator then we train a tiny plug in network that learns to switch the generator to the summarization regime we demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms competitive ones both abstractive and extractive in human and automatic evaluation finally we show that it also allows for successful cross domain adaptation acknowledgments we would like to thank members of edinburgh nlp group for discussion and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback we gratefully edge the support of the european research council titov erc stg broadsem lapata erc cog transmodal and the dutch national science foundation nwo vidi we matched data point count for domains of training and validation sets to the in domain zon data experiment presented in sec the test set remained the same for each domain as in the in domain experiment then we ne tuned the same model times with different seeds per target domain for comparison we used the in domain model which was used in amazon experiments in sec we computed the average rouge l score per target domain where overall was the results are reported in table the results indicate that the models perform par on most of the domains supporting the sis on the other hand the in domain model shows substantially better results on the health domain which is expected as intuitively this domain is the most different from the rest related work extractive weakly supervised opinion rization has been an active area of research lexrank erkan and radev is an pervised extractive model opinosis ganesan et al does not use any supervision and relies on pos tags and redundancies to generate short opinions however this approach is not well suited for the generation of coherent long summaries and although it can recombine fragments of input text it can not generate novel words and phrases other earlier approaches gerani et al di brizio et al relied on text planners and plates which restrict the output text a more cent extractive method of angelidis and lapata frames the problem as a pipeline of steps with different models for each step isonuma et al introduce an unsupervised approach for gle product review summarization where they rely on latent discourse trees the most related pervised approach to this work is our own work copycat brazinskas et al unlike that work we rely on a powerful generator to learn ditional spaces of text without hierarchical latent variables finally in contract to meansum chu and liu our model relies on inductive ases without explicitly modeling of

we used for ing validation and testing respectively both the automatic and human evaluation experiments were performed on the test sets training procedure first to speed up the training phase we trained an unconditional language model for epoch on the amazon reviews with the learning rate lr set to on yelp we trained it for epochs with lr set to the language model was used to initialize both the encoder and generator of the main model subsequently we trained the model using eq for epochs on the amazon reviews with lr and for epochs with lr set to additionally we reduced novelty using eq by training the model further for epoch with lr and on amazon on yelp we trained for epochs with lr and for the plugin network s initialization as plained in sec we performed optimization by output

summary text we used the following instructions the summary should reect user common opinions expressed in the reviews try to serve the common sentiment of the opinions and their details e what exactly the users like or dislike for example if most reviews are negative about the sound quality then also write negatively about it please make the summary coherent and uent in terms of sentence
