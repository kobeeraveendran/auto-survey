e f l c s c v v i x r a clinical text summarization with syntax based negation and semantic concept identication wei hung weng edu yu an chung edu schrasing tong edu introduction in the era of clinical information explosion a good strategy for clinical text summarization is helpful to improve the clinical workow charles et al the ideal summarization strategy can preserve important information in the informative but less organized ill structured clinical narrative texts instead of using pure statistical learning approaches which are difcult to interpret and explain we utilized knowledge of computational linguistics with human experts curated biomedical knowledge base to achieve the interpretable and meaningful clinical text summarization our research objective is to use the biomedical ontology with semantic information and take the advantage from the language hierarchical structure hamburger and crain the constituency tree in order to identify the correct clinical concepts and the corresponding negation information which is critical for summarizing clinical concepts from narrative text we rst used the classical natural language processing nlp approaches such as sectioning sentence and word tokenization with stanford corenlp manning et al we then identifed clinical concepts in the narrative texts by several nlp components in the apache clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system ctakes savova et al which include the clinical word level morphological and semantic analyzers along with biomedical knowledge base unied medical language system umls and semantic network bodenreider mccray for negation detection we collected a list of negated terms e no rule out no evidence of and categorized them into different negation types next we detected negated concepts in the clinical sentences through sentence pruning syntactic analysis and parsing using apache opennlp and stanford tregex tsurgeon toolkits levy and andrew then we combined the negation information of each identied concept and constructed an curated itemized list of concepts by localizing the identied concepts in each document section finally we conducted case studies for error analysis and the direction of further improvement and also evaluated the performance of the proposed method quantitatively the curated itemized list of clinically important concepts generated by our method may be the prototype for clinical effective communication in this study we achieved the clinically acceptable performance for both negation detection and concept identication the clinical concepts with common negated patterns can be identied and negated yet we also found that the concepts inside fragmented sentences or sentences with medical abbreviations may not be correctly identied and negated the key challenge is that such sentences may not be parsed correctly by the statistical learning based constituency tree parser that we relied on to obtain the correct syntactic patterns future directions of the project may focus on designing more syntatcic rules for different sentence structure especially for clinical fragmented sentences investigating different constituency tree parsing models to t the clinical content and obtain correct constituency trees for downstream clinical syntax based negation and clinical concept identication motivation clinicians often face with the dilemma whether they should spend more time on seeing patients or go through clinical data carefully without missing any information clinical information explosion which results from the great adoption of electronic health record ehr aggravates this problem due to the exponential growth of the available clinical multimodal data charles et al among all modalities of clinical data clinical narrative text is one of the most important sources for the appropriate patient care since it is not the raw physiological signals or raw imaging data but the information that is recorded by trained clinicians after human thinking and reasoning weng et al in other words clinical narrative texts includes clinicians thoughts and reasonings about patient s condition and treatment strategy therefore reading medical records is essential for good clinical care yet it is also a time consuming task even for well trained clinicians oxentenko et al this is because that clinicians are trained to use the specic documentation style sentence structures with medical jargons and abbreviations or semantically meaningful but syntactically fragmented sentences to record patients clinical history disease progression and the results of examinations therefore how to condense and summarize the document but keep the useful clinical concepts for the effective communication between clinicians becomes an important issue regarding text summarization task in the eld of nlp the state of the art approach is deep learning algorithms which utilizing the ability of stacked neural network layers that can approximate different mathematical functions to learn the semantics of words sentences and documents for example recent studies used neural networks with the sequence to sequence model or even reinforcement learning to demonstrate high performances on abstractive text summarization task in the general purpose paulus et al nallapati et al rush et al however deep learning algorithms may not be the optimal choice for clinical corpus due to some reasons first clinical corpus is usually much smaller than general purpose corpus for instance the english wikipedia has more than four million documents yet the largest publicly available intensive care unit icu clinical database medical information mart for intensive care mimic iii has less than clinical summaries johnson et al for current deep learning approach learning from small data is usually a big issue that is hard to overcome lake et al secondly there is a huge biomedical knowledge base already existing bodenreider this knowledge base has already integrated with many biomedical ontologies as well using biomedical concepts is helpful for text summarization since the texts can be normalized and itemized into the standardized terminologies in community consensus for example different texts cr cr cre creat creatinine will be normalize to creatinine with appropriate ontology mapping in contrast deep learning algorithms will take them as different independent tokens there is also no feasible approaches to integrate this knowledge framework into machine learning and deep neural network architecture due to their fundamental differences moreover it is important to make the method much precise and interpretable rather than providing a transparent but hard to explained approximation function for clinical related tasks most clinical problems have a characteristics of near zero tolerance of error lipton thus articial intelligence method implementations in medicine usually require close inspection and evaluation by human clinical experts rather than just reporting few metrics for example misidentifying patient with malignant tumor to without malignant tumor in the pathology report will result in devastating outcome for the automated clinical text summarization task negation detection becomes one of the tial components since they play a critical role for preventing fatal errors which may result from computational models current standard for the clinical negation is the regular expression based method chapman et al the capability of using regular expression in linear string structure is interpretable but limited since human assembles language in a hierarchical geometrical structure rather than linear way hamburger and crain researchers also approached the clinical negation problem from both the machine learning and linguistic based methods rather than the simple regular expression approach miller et al mehrabi et al gindl et al machine learning approach may be extraordinary to discover the patterns that human can not nd however the model is hard to be interpreted by our knowledge of human language which is essential for analyzing the linguistic structure these may be the reasons why the current clinical negation system can not be generalizable in this project we therefore proposed a method and pipeline to integrate both the syntax based negation detection and the semantic clinical concept identication for the clinical text summarization task for better clinical effective communication previous work clinical text summarization the key components of this project are clinical text summarization and clinical text negation detection for clinical text summarization current approaches are mainly based on extractive and indicative methods which extract the original clinical text but not replace the original text to the clinical concept pivovarov moen et al goldstein and shahar most studies adopted machine learning algorithms to tackle the problem pivovarov et al performed machine learning algorithms such as latent dirichlet allocation lda and bayesian networks to point out the important pieces in the original clinical document pivovarov moen et al extract key sentences using machine learning based word space models moen et al goldstein and shahar utilized the knowledge based heuristics to extract the related sentences from the clinical text goldstein and shahar to our knowledge there is no literature on clinical text summarization on the clinical concept level using itemized semantic concepts for clinical text summarization however the itemized list instead of the paragraph is preferred since the former structure expression is easy to understand and well structured clinical negation detection the current gold standard for the clinical negation detection is the regular expression based method without considering language hierarchical structure chapman et al the standard algorithms context and negex context algorithms identify negated clinical concepts using regular expression by a list of negation trigger terms and linear token windows rather than the syntactic structure of sentence chapman et al researchers also investigated the clinical negation problem through a linguistic approach gindl et al looked into the part of speech pos and the syntactic meaning of the negated term in the sentence gindl et al mehrabi et al adopted dependency parsing to improve the performance of regular expression based negex system mehrabi et al these studies attepmted to look into the linguistic structure of sentence but did not consider the hierarchical structure of the sentence others attempted to utilize the power of machine learning to discover the negation pattern in the different corpora as well miller et al used unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm based on structural correspondence learning scl and boot strapping miller et al cruz et al adopted the support vector machine algorithm to detect negation for sentiment analysis cruz et al fancellu et al utilized the recurrent neural network architecture bidirectional long short term memory lstm to detect negation scope in non biomedical corpora fancellu et al these machine learning methods usually yield promising performance but are hard to interpret and difcult to x errors even if the error analysis was conducted in the study we adopted the idea of the negation trigger term list and took the advantage of the syntactic structure of language for clinical negation detection methodology and implementation our proposed method allows us to summarize a clinical narrative document into an itemized clinical concept list by identifying clinical concepts with the corresponding negation information both the sentence and fragment level syntactic analysis as well as the word level morphological and semantic analysis for clinical named entity recognition ner were used in the study we rst used the small set of sentences with negation along with a list of curated negated trigger terms negation terms and phrases to design and implement a syntax based negation detector section then we adopted the clinical nlp pipeline and medical ontology to identify and extract biomedical concepts in the narrative texts through ner with knowledge base lookup section next the extracted concepts were ltered semantically only the clinically relevant concepts were preserved to create the curated itemized list along with their negation information which obtained from negation detector the full workow is shown in figure we also conducted error analysis for the clinical negation and see how to improve the performance of detecting negated concepts figure workow of syntax based negation detection upper and semantic clinical concept identication lower linguistic preprocessing we applied stanford corenlp toolkit for common linguistic preprocessing steps manning et al such as clinical document section and sentence fragmentation word tokenization stopword removal before further natural language analysis tasks syntactic analysis and processing of negation for detecting negation we applied the apache opennlp library which is an open source machine learning based toolkit for nlp to obtain constituency trees we also used tregex and tsurgeon which are the tools for analyzing patterns of constituency trees and pattern matching via tree relationships and regular expression levy and andrew the foundation of syntax based negation detection is the collected negation trigger terms we rst collected negation trigger terms and formed a negation term list negation terms both negation words and phrases that are commonly used in clinical writing were collected from multilingual negex lexicon medinfo april version chapman et al with manual modications and additions we analyzed all collected negation terms and assigned them to the appropriate negation type regarding their negation location and negation phrase structure for example the negation term no belongs to pre negation regarding the feature of location and np of negation phrase type since no usually expresses in the pattern of no congestive heart failure no known allergy which the term is followed by a noun phrase therefore no has the characteristics of pre negation and np type negation negation location the negation location is necessary for the meaningful sentence pruning before constituency tree parsing we designed ve categories of the negation location chapman et al pre negation pren post negation posn pre possible negation prep post possible negation posp and pseudonegation pseu which is not a true negation the motivation and further discussion of pesudonegation is in section table provides few examples of each type of negation location there are pre negation post negation pre possible negation post possible negation and pseudonegation terms in our negation trigger term list table examples of commonly seen clinical negation terms in each negation location pre negation no no evidence without can not unremarkable for post negation free unlikely was ruled out is ruled out have been ruled out may be ruled out for pre possible ro r o rule out rule out for post possible not ruled out did not rule out not been ruled out be ruled out is to be ruled out pseudonegation no increase no change not cause without difculty not only negation phrase structure the goal of assigning the appropriate negation phrase structure is to explore general patterns of clinical negation and design commands for the tregex tsurgeon manipulation to be noticed the negation phrase structure is not the phrase type of the negation term but the type of interaction between the negation term and the negated concept we started from the simple rules and used real world clinical sentences to iteratively design our strategy and rules to identify more negation patterns in order to achieve the generalizability the sentences are analyzed by human to detect the common patterns of acceptable negation meaning in the syntactic structures we mainly used bottom up parsing with leftmost derivation in our manual investigation this characteristic is for appropriate tregex tsurgeon manipulation of the sentences with different syntactic structures in general there are eight categories we found the following very common valid negation phrase structure patterns of clinical negation that are simple but can cover more than of constituency trees without overtting np negation vp a vp anterior negation vp p vp posterior negation pp negation adjp a adjp anterior negation adjp p adjp posterior negation advp a advp anterior negation and advp p advp posterior negation pseudonegation does not have the negation phrase structure type assignment since they are not valid negations at all these categories are all possible options for clinical negation table table common negation phrase structure patterns negation type example command in tregex tsurgeon format np vp a vp p pp adjp a adjp p advp a advp p np target neg np top t delete neg vp target top t delete neg vp vp np head top t s s excise s head pp head in np target top t excise s target pp head np target top t excise s target vp vp np head top t s s excise s head vp head rb neg top t s s excise s head vp head rb neg top t s s delete head delete neg we also added few negation patterns to tackle some exceptions for example the sentence with sbar with coordinate or with some grammatical errors but commonly seen in clinical texts for excessive capturing of the negation span we applied tsurgeon to excise the subtrees for example we can remove the sbar part of subtree under the np with negated concepts using the syntax np no sbar sbar delete sbar figure sbar is usually removable in most clinical sentences especially after sentence pruning by localizing the negation term we listed few examples for some exceptions in table table negation patterns for some exceptions negation type forced sbar removal np without s node for fragmented sentence example commands in tregex tsurgeon format sbar sbar delete sbar np target np top t delete neg figure examples of inappropriate subtree in this case the correct negated concept is congestive heart failure only the sbar part should not be included for concept negation in our implementation users can add new customized tregex tsurgeon patterns and the corresponding conditions when they discover the new rules for negation patterns other characteristics for negation types we also used the pos tagger model in nltk model to identify the pos of the rst word in each negated trigger term we used this negation trigger term list with the additional designed features to detect negated concepts and their span in the following experiments sentence pruning we extracted and pruned the sentences with negation patterns by identifying negation terms within the prepared negation term list we rst identied whether the sentence includes the negation term if no we then labeled them as non negated sentence if yes we then pruned the sentence based on the characteristics of negation location for example the sentence left lower ext edema u s was performed no evidence of dvt will become no evidence of dvt since no evidence of is a pre negation negation term we assume that only the concepts after this negation term may be negated the purpose of the sentence pruning is to reduce the complexity of sentence parsing since the negation patterns of constituency trees become much complex when the sentence becomes longer for the longer sentence the uncertainty of the statistical parser we used to obtain constituency trees may be higher sentence parsing next the negated clinical sentences fragments were imported into the opennlp pipeline and used its maximum entropy algorithm based sentence parsing to obtain corresponding constituency trees once the constituency tree is obtained we utilized the syntactic parsing tools tregex tsurgeon along with the corresponding negation phrase structure type to identify the negated subtrees and extracted them to match and negate the corresponding clinical concepts to extract the negated subtree by tsurgeon we applied top down approach since that we have tried bottom up method but the latter approach could not capture all possible negated concepts for example the tsurgeon syntax of extracting the subtree with the pattern of np no is np head no top t s s excise s head we also experimented on using stanford corenlp api for all tasks from section and sentence tokenization to constituency tree parsing however we shifted back to opennlp syntactic parsing with tregex command line version due to the speed concern an example of negation detection the following is an articial user case for the full process of negation detection dvt deep vein thrombosis u s ultrasound clinical document section and sentence tokenization by stanford corenlp left lower ext edema u s was performed no evidence of dvt obtaining the syntactic parse tree by opennlp top s s vp vbd left np jjr lower jj ext nn s s np nnp u s vp vbd was vp vbn performed s np np no nn evidence pp in of np nn dvt extracting the subtree with the negated term and concept by tregex with manual designed rules in this case we used very simple rule np no np no nn evidence pp in of np nn dvt extracting the negated clinical concept by regular expression np dvt this step is important for error analysis and improving the performance of the negation detection the modied version of the clinical negated term list is available in the github repository weng morphological syntactic and semantic analysis we applied ctakes for morphological and syntactic analysis for clinical concept ner savova et al ctakes is an open source nlp system for ehr free text information extraction it is built on the basis of unstructured information management architecture uima ferrucci and lally which is an open source scalable and extensible platform for nlp ctakes has several analytical engines for processing narrative texts to identify correct and useful biomedical concepts which are usually named entities in different clinical semantic categories we adopted lexical normalizer pos tagger and phrasal chunker to correctly perform ner task after the concept identication by ctakes we connected the concepts to the biomedical knowledge base umls metathesaurus for semantic analysis and dictionary lookup bodenreider umls metathesaurus is a large multi purpose thesaurus with millions of biomedical and clinical related concepts and their relationships we specically used two clinical highly relevant ontologies in umls systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms snomed ct and rxnorm for concept semantic mapping the standard terminology approach may be helpful for further analysis of using clinical narrative tasks for machine learning clustering classication and prediction then we further utilized the umls semantic network to lter clinically relevant umls concepts in clinical notes mccray mccray et al we adopted the trained clinician pre dened semantic types and semantic groups for ltering table weng et al tools we used use the natural language toolkit package and stanford corenlp toolkit version for text preprocessing and lexical normalization such as word tokenization and stemming process bird and loper table designed clinical semantic categories and the corresponding examples semantics disorder syndrome symptom sign umls semantic types examples hypertension ab chf chest pain cough hypovolemic medication diagnostic procedure anatomy epinephrine acei insulin ns ct scan mri of brain pet biopsy left knee right thyroid segment vi we used apache opennlp version tregex and tsurgeon version rst by working with its gui tregexgui but will use the command line version later for batch processing levy and andrew for negation syntax analysis the pipeline of morphological syntactic and semantic analysis for clinical ner was integrated and implemented on python version with ctakes version umls metathesaurus version will be adopted for all clinical semantic mapping and ltering all source codes and the instruction are available in the github repository weng testing data and preprocessing for testing clinical narrative texts were randomly selected from the mimic iii critical care database johnson et al which contains icu patients admitted to the beth israel deaconess medical center bidmc a large tertiary medical center in boston massachusetts usa we extracted narrative discharge summaries from the mimic iii database and randomly choose the result of three notes to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method the three testing notes are not overlapped with the negated sentences used for developing rules development set as well as the sentences in evaluation set for evaluation we used annotated negated sentences provided by negex context repository man which are also not overlapped with the development set the detailed was shown in the section of evaluation we provide the development set and evaluation set in our code repository however testing notes are not available due to the terms and conditions in use of mimic iii narrative text data therefore we provided the slightly revised version of testing notes below for readers experiment in the testing phase we demonstrated the result of summarizing three random clinical narrative notes in mimic iii we also performed the error analysis by discussing the issues we found in the real cases the error analysis gave us insights of the limitation and pitfall of our proposed method especially the part of using machine learning based statistical parser and in what conditions should we be cautious of using the tools based on statistical and machine learning approaches in the end we provide conclusions of the investigation of the testing phase testing case in the rst testing case we conducted the qualitative analysis of both concept identication and negation detection tasks we highlighted some key issues in our discussion of error analysis the original narrative text and the output of our proposed method are shown below here we provided two sections of the note history of present illness and brief hospital course since they are usually the most ill structured sections in the clinical note history of present illness year old female with recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis on mercaptopurine prednisone mg daily who presents with a new onset of headache and neck stiffness the patient is in

congestive heart unstable several npo nothing by parenteral nutrition history of blood anemia of chronic npo nothing by parenteral nutrition prophylactic hepatoerythropoietic respiratory secretion npo nothing by rehabilitation concept identication initially we found that using the original ctakes ner component does not consider the span of concept and may obtain redundant concepts for example it will recognize ulcerative colitis as three concepts ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis yet we just want to capture the longest concept ulcerative colitis thus we further implemented the script for detecting the longest extracted concept for these redundant concept identication nevertheless current concept identication approach may still miss some concepts for example we just identied phonophobia from or phonophobia since is not a usual clinical concept in our ontology the possible solution is to preserve the original text along with the mapped concepts to prevent information loss after the concept mapping step negation detection there are seven sentences in this note which contain negation terms in the beginning we missed the negated concepts of vegetation essential tremor but captured the afrmative concepts of pulmonary edema we found that the issue came from sentences with sbar structure that usually can not be handled by designed general rules for example in her neurological exam was markedly improved and by her headache was gone no meningeal signs noted although her baseline essential tremor was slightly more severe the concept essential tremor in the sbar should not be negated but the system indeed capture it therefore we designed the rule to handle the sbar condition by removing them is important for precise negation detection in the following testing cases we will mainly focus on the sentence with negation terms for negation detection since the issue of concept identication is similar across all inspected cases testing note concept identication there is only one additional issue need to be pointed out regarding concept identication the clinical ner task using ctakes with biomedical knowledge base and semantic information may miss capturing the concepts or map to inappropriate concepts while ontology mapping due to ambiguity for example ivf can indicate intravenous uid or fertilization to capture correct clinical concepts further investigation across sentences concerning semantics should be considered cross sentence semantics for identifying concepts may be achievable through the statistical approach such as word embedding algorithms based on co occurrence of words negation detection there are sentences in this note that contain negation trigger term most negation terms are correctly identied in this case for example we can capture multiple negated concepts in the same sentence she otherwise denies any vomiting rash rhinorrhea dysuria cough sob or abdominal discomfort which is not able to be identied if we use the negex window size based approach since they can set an arbitrary negated span usually ve words before or after the negation trigger term in this testing case we can still remove the redundant part of the sentence e sbar part to reduce the unnecessary negation span however we also found that some medical terms can not be identied by opennlp parser and therefore they will be ignored during the construction of constituency trees for example the negated medication concept neulasta was not recognized by statistical parser and therefore was not be negated in the end the reason may due to the fact that such clinical terms are not shown in the original training dataset for opennlp parser the constituency tree of this case is as following original most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt s request however due to the rapid rise in her wbc count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility tree top s s np np adjp rbs most jj likely this jj current nn episode pp in of np nn neutropenia vp vbz is adjp jj due pp to to np the nn fact sbar in that vbn given pp in during np np this nn cycle pp in of np np np nn chemo pp in per np np nn pos nn request adjp rb however jj due pp to to np np the jj rapid nn rise pp in in np her nnp wbc nn count nn myelosuppression pp in from np nn sepsis vp vbd was advp rb also np a nn possibility one can see that neulasta was gone in the tree a potential solution might be replacing professional clinical terms especially the name of medication or clinical procedure to some special token such as medication and record the original name along with their location in other place once the medication is captured and negated we can replace them back to the original name of medication otherwise the negation detection did well in this case the input and output of the proposed pipeline are shown as following history of present illness she stated that for the past two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her stool she otherwise denies any vomiting rash rhinorrhea dysuria cough sob or abdominal discomfort she denies any recent travel or sick contacts as well his cxr did not show denitive source of infection either while in the ed she developed hypotension not responding to ivf boluses the pt denied cvl placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine peripherially in order to maintain sbps in the she did not have a change in her mentation during these episodes of hypotension history of present illness itemized concepts abdominal abdominal discomfort illness source of fertilization in brief hospital course neutropenic on presentation the pt s pmn count was most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of neulasta use when cdiff returned negative agyl was discontinued blood cultures were sent and a u a was not concerning for infection we also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta d glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative the following day after admission her wbc rose signicantly and she no longer was neutropenic she was continued on vanc cefepime until afebrile and with for greater than hours after which she was switched to po levooxacin to complete an day total course for community acquired pneumonia in the pt s sbp dropped to not responding to ivf boluses she was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt s request however due to the rapid rise in her wbc count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility brief hospital course itemized concepts communicable fertilization in probable testing note again we only focus on the sentences with negated terms for negation detection there are sentences in this note which contain negated terms in general the negation detection can nd the negated concepts correctly in most cases the issue raises in this case is that sometimes using only tregex tsurgeon can not remove the negation term due to the structure of constituency tree for example in the following case the negation term negative for is splitted and hard to be removed by tregex tsurgeon original abdominal ct was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump subtree top np np nn negative pp in for np np an nn abscess cc or nn fluid nn collection vp vbg surrounding np the nn pump the possible solution again is simply use regular expression to remove the negation term however we did not specically implement this part since the negation terms will be removed anyway after the clinical concept identication and mapping for future renement we may experiment on whether using constituency tree structure for negating concepts and using linear regular expression for removing negation trigger terms will be helpful history of present illness cxr showed cardiomegaly but no inltrate abdominal ct was negative for an abscess or uid collection surrounding the pump history of present illness itemized concepts brief hospital course pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication a tte ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group b strep bacteremia surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended the culture returned positive for mrsa and gram negative rods not conservative management given that it had no signs of infection pseudomonas once the gnr sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas ceftaz was stopped she was without signs of baclofen withdrawal i e incr hr temp bp seizures once pump was removed an eeg on hd was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an eeg on hd was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures an mri was nally done on hd and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke after a supposed seizure at osh pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b c no breath sounds were appreciated at baseline pt has respiratory weakeness to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation brief hospital course itemized concepts group b streptococcal streptococcal conservative physical communicable mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus rod antimicrobial physical baclofen grade severe adverse mild adverse communicating cerebrovascular multiple other interesting patterns we found that the pre negation term is commonly seen in tingling or the middle of noun phrase np np np nn neurologic np no nn numbness np nn tingling cc or np nn weakness which commonly happens in examination sections our sentence pruning strategy is helpful to remove the sive negation in such cases however this may also result in the trade off of the appearance of fragmented sentence and the capability of statistical parser for no numbness we also found the existence of double negation in the clinical texts the commonly seen double negation problem is due to the negation of already negated words for example if the negated word is no abnormalabnormal has already contained the semantics of negation then it is not negated after adding no in front of it and we should labeled them as pseudonegation we designed the specic negation type for commonly seen clinical pseudonegation terms to prevent such false negation conclusion of the testing phase from the above analysis of real testing cases we realize that proposed approach gives us precise summarized information but still have a space to improve the performance concept identication using the semantic concept identication approach has the advantage of standardization the extracted concepts are standardized by biomedical knowledge base and ontology so the issues of writing style and english grammar can be ignored as much as possible the standardized concepts can also be processed and compared afterward for large scale clinical text analysis as well however for the concept identication task there are still some parts that we can improve beyond the span of concept that we have solved there are still some concepts that are not correctly captured for example some medications are missing in the summarization we may need to relax the restriction of semantic ltering by adding more semantic types however we need to keep in mind the trade off between the amount of necessary information and usefulness of the information presenting both the original text and the identied umls concept as well as using word embedding approach to enhance the semantics between sentence may also be helpful for improvement negation detection for the negation detection task our approach worked well with acceptable performance judge by the clinician since it can capture most of the negated concepts if they are correctly identied by semantic concept identication some of the correctly negated concepts are removed during concept identication we can handle common double negation cases by introducing the family of pseudonegation terms however different from general negation cases there are still some very special clinical negations that we are not yet able to capture well for example afebrile means no fever test case we need to explore other strategy to identify those concepts contain the semantics of negation within the concept which are not able to be correctly negated by using the negation trigger terms list approach in the sentence level we pruned the whole sentence into the possible negated portion using negation trigger term list and their features of or post negation the advantage of this approach is that we can minimize the error parsing that usually happens in opennlp or any statistical parsing tools however the following issue of this approach is that the sentence may be fragmented the fragmented issue is also a common problem in raw clinical texts for example no acute distress or without any evidence of signicant anemia we need to consider more about the syntactic structure with complicated condition such as sbar or fragmented sentences which may be parsed incorrectly by opennlp parser string pattern matching instead of constituency tree parsing is inevitable to correctly identify these cases initially we attempted to solve the problem through rewriting the sentences however it is not feasible to generalize patterns for rewriting the clinical negation sentences thus we instead approached the problem through adding more rules to deal with exceptions which may be much helpful to improve the performance of negation detection even if we face the new text corpus in the future tools there are some issues raised from the tools we adopted in the project tregex can only operate one node at once this limited us to do only one step manipulation in one command thus multiple steps processing is required for complicated cases tregex can not handle multiple matches however since the goal of our task is to detect the span of negation it is okay to cover whole span without removing all negated terms for example once we detected the rst no in she otherwise no vomiting no rash no rhinorrhea no dysuria no cough no sob and no abdominal discomfort then we can just mark all concepts after this negation term without specically removing other nowhich means that single match is useful enough for us to detect the negated concepts the maximum entropy based opennlp parsing algorithm can not always parse sentences in a correct way there are some issues for adjp and pp negated types in opennlp parsing no evidence of and negative for are usually splitted by opennlp we need to remove the negation term arbitrarily through linear string pattern matching if needed however for negating the concepts this is a minor issue since we will not preserve those negation terms after concept identication through mapping biomedical ontology for example opennlp parses no evidence of seizures to the tree like figure tregex will only crop out no evidence and leave of seizures which is not the exact result we want yet we will only obtain the correct negated concept seizures after ontology mapping figure opennlp parsing for pp type negation no evidence of result presentation for visualizing the result a better approach to present our result to make our itemized list be easier to interpret is needed for instance building a hierarchical structured tree for detailed items as we see in the le system of computers e brief hospital course congestive heart failure treatment several concepts about medications evaluation we evaluated the performance of negation detection using negated concepts in clinical negated sentences for evaluation we reported the accuracy of negation detection we briey discussed the result and did analyzed the error cases in two different approaches since the human explanation is required for potential clinical use we need to make the proposed method be explainable and interpretable we provide the evaluation set in our code repository under txt which is derived from txt from the negex context algorithm with our human labeling evaluating negation detection for the negation detection the clinician was asked to examined the output of all negated sentences and labeled the negated clinical concepts inside the sentences then the clinician evaluated whether the method captured or missed the negated concepts manually we also ran the baseline regular expression based negex algorithm for comparison then we computed the accuracy of negation detection between our proposed approach and negex approach the performance of negation detection is shown in table table performance of negation detection method syntax based proposed approach regular expression based implemented negex algorithm accuracy we hypothesized that syntax based negation detection works better than baseline regular based detection since the latter approach considers only the language linear structure but not the hierarchical structure the regular expression based approach uses the window size and punctuation to determine the span of negation which is intuitive but may be limited to capture the negation in complex or long sentences however the syntax based approach still faces problems due to the limitation of the statistical parser that generates constituency trees in our case the maximum entropy based apache opennlp parser we found that some rules we designed to prune and extract the constituency subtrees are not optimized for example in the following examples we demonstrated in the format of our intermediate result during processing negated sent original normal saline contrast injection without evidence of right to left intracardiac shunt neg part without evidence of right to left intracardiac shunt negated term without evidence of tregex tsurgeon with negated type pp constituency tree top pp in without np nn right sbar s vp to to vp vb left np jj intracardiac nn shunt np without s node constituency tree top pp in without np np np nn evidence pp in of np nn right sbar s vp to to vp vb left np jj intracardiac nn shunt forced remove sbar constituency tree top pp in without np np np nn evidence pp in of np nn right remove first token f if in negated list or stopword list evidence of right opennlp parsed this fragmented sentence in a strange way and split the concepts that should be negated right to left intracardiac shunt to evidence of right np and to left intracardiac shunt sbar which is not correct therefore we did not obtain the correct negated concepts in this case due to the incorrect constituency tree however this is an issue for all clinical narrative text analysis tasks since clinical texts usually have a characteristics of fragmentation abbreviation as well as using incorrect grammars for clinical convenience and time saving to further improve the performance of syntax based negation detection the best approach to improve the statistical model is to collect the human annotation of pos tagging and constituency tree tagging for fragmented sentences and clinical abbreviation however this may not be a feasible approach since it is a labor clinical task the alternative way is to investigate other potential statistical models to obtain constituency trees using different machine learning models may decrease the interpretability but may be helpful to boost the performance for example using recurrent neural network sequential models sutskever et al or even the hierarchical model such as treelstm tai et al that might be possible to preserve the semantics in the hierarchy evaluating concept identication for the concept identication we also asked the clinician to label the meaningful clinical concepts in the sentences of evaluation set by his expertise and examined the result of automated extracted clinical concepts then we computed the accuracy precision recall and score to investigate whether ctakes clinical ner with umls metathesaurus knowledge base can capture meaningful clinical concepts with without using semantic network ltering for only clinically relevant concepts the performance of concept identication is shown in table table performance of concept identication using ctakes clinical ner and umls knowledge base with or without semantic network ltering for clinical concepts score accuracy precision recall score with semantic ltering without semantic ltering utilizing the strategy of umls semantic ltering can signicantly reduce the case number of false positive and therefore yields much precise summarized information this is not surprised since the full set of umls metathesaurus contains many redundant concepts with semantic types that are not related to clinical work for example amino acid peptide or protein embryonic structure regulation or law experimental model of disease gene or genome these concepts might be useful for biomedical literature analysis but not for clinical documents however there are still two main issues of using ctakes and umls metathesaurus mapping there are issues of ambiguity and granularity in concept identication for example posterior neck pain versus neck pain drug allergy versus allergy tongue elevation versus elevation occult blood versus blood ctakes clinical ner sometimes gives us the concept with higher granularity but sometimes not we may want to map to concepts using the largest word span to minimize the uncertainty of the ambiguity and granularity issue occasionally umls metathesaurus has both afrmative and negated concept identiers for some clinical concepts to prevent from incorrect negation we may need to improve the negation detection to ensure that we will not leave the negation terms in the input for concept identication conclusion in this study we demonstrated that the proposed method of combining the syntax based negation detection and semantic concept identication provides us the ability for clinical narrative tion the key contributions of this project are designing and developing a strategy and rules of classifying negated trigger terms for better negation detection utilizing the constituency tree to identify the negation pattern syntactically and apply different rules to identify the neagted concepts identifying the clinically relevant concepts using biomedical knowledge base with semantic information along with syntax based negation information we also realized that the language linear structure is efcient but not enough to capture the correct syntax hierarchical nature of human language should not be ignored for such natural language tasks having the expert knowledge of clinical semantic information also allow us to obtain the better concept identication and summarization for future investigation we plan to work on improving and customizing the constituency parser for clinical narrative texts we also plan to design more rules for fragmented sentences and abbreviations that are usually seen in clinical content based on the human knowledge of clinical language we also plan to improve the statistical learning part of sentence parsing with different hierarchical learning models such as treelstm we hope that the proposed method can be a prototype of the clinical text summarization tool for effective clinical communication references stration

identification introduction we utilized the power of computational linguistics with human experts curated knowledge base for identifying clinical concepts with their corresponding negation information in the clinical narrative texts we used the medical knowledge base umls along with semantic network and take the advantage from the language hierarchical structure the constituency tree in order to identify the clinically relevant concepts and the negation information which is extremely important for summarization in this project we used stanford corenlp apache clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system ctakes unified medical language system umls and semantic network to identify clinical concepts in the narrative texts we also performed the negation detection in the clinical sentences through sentence pruning syntactic analysis and parsing using apache opennlp and stanford tregex tsurgeon then we constructed itemized lists of clinically important concepts using
