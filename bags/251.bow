pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization jingqing zhang yao zhao mohammad saleh peter j liu abstract recent work pre training transformers with self supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when ne tuned on downstream nlp tasks including text rization however pre training objectives lored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse in this work we propose pre training mains large transformer based encoder decoder els on massive text corpora with a new supervised objective in pegasus important sentences are removed masked from an input ument and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences similar to an extractive

all downstream datasets measured by rouge scores our model also shows ing performance on low resource summarization surpassing previous state of the art results on datasets with only examples finally

conference on machine learning vienna austria pmlr copyright by the figure the base architecture of pegasus is a standard transformer encoder decoder both gsg and mlm are applied simultaneously to this example as pre training jectives originally there are three sentences one sentence is masked with and used as target generation text gsg the other two sentences remain in the input but some tokens are randomly masked by mlm introduction text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise summaries from input in contrast to extractive summarization which merely copies informative fragments from the input abstractive summarization may generate novel words a good abstractive summary covers principal information in the input and is linguistically uent summarization in abstractive sequence to sequence sutskever et al has become a dominant framework using encoder decoder architectures based on rnns chung et al hochreiter schmidhuber and more recently transformers vaswani et al most prior work on neural abstractive summarization relied on large scale high quality datasets of supervised document summary pairs hermann et al and achieved promising results rush et al nallapati et al see et al in recent years there has been increased interest in collecting new summarization datasets that have more abstractive summaries narayan et al have longer documents cohan et al sharma et al utilize multiple documents fabbri et al and are sourced from diverse domains grusky et al koupaee wang kim et al kornilova eidelman zhang tetreault pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization however there has been little work on systematic evaluation of models across these broad settings contemporaneously the adoption of transformer models vaswani et al pre trained using self supervised jectives on large text corpora radford et al devlin et al have improved performance on many nlp tasks wang et al rajpurkar et al recent work leveraging such pre training for based sequence to sequence models dong et al song et al rothe et al lewis et al raffel et al has extended the success to text tion including abstractive summarization in this work we study pre training objectives specically for abstractive text summarization and evaluate on stream datasets spanning news hermann et al narayan et al grusky et al rush et al fabbri et al science cohan et al short stories kim et al instructions koupaee wang emails zhang tetreault patents sharma et al and legislative bills kornilova eidelman we nd that masking whole sentences from a ment and generating these gap sentences from the rest of the document works well as a pre training objective for stream summarization tasks in particular choosing tively important sentences outperforms lead or randomly selected ones we hypothesize this objective is suitable for abstractive summarization as it closely resembles the stream task encouraging whole document understanding and summary like generation we call this self supervised objective gap sentences generation gsg using gsg to pre train a transformer encoder decoder on large pora of documents web and news articles results in our method pre training with extracted gap sentences for stractive summarization sequence to sequence models or pegasus with our best m parameter model trained on the cently introduced raffel et al we equal or exceed state of the art on the summarization tasks we consider we further push forward the state of the art using a newly collected text corpus comprised of news like articles we call hugenews including the highly competitive xsum and cnn dailymail summarization datasets large scale document summary datasets are rare and in practice there is a mismatch between research datasets and real world use cases where collecting summaries is sive the most common setting is that of low resource marization we simulate this setting and show that our model is able to adapt very quickly when ne tuning with small numbers of supervised pairs obtaining state of the art results in datasets with only examples qualitatively we observed high quality outputs from our best models and validated this in human evaluation studies we found that pegasus summaries are at least as good as reference summaries for the datasets we assessed xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu even at low levels of supervision to summarize our contributions we propose a new self supervised pre training tive for abstractive summarization gap sentences eration and study strategies for selecting those tences we evaluate the proposed pre training objective on a broad range of downstream summarization tasks with careful ablations to choose the best model settings which we use to train a m parameter pegasus model that surpasses or is on par with the state of art on all downstream datasets considered we show how good abstractive summarization mance can be achieved across broad domains with very little supervision by ne tuning the pegasus model and surpassing previous state of the art results on many tasks with as little as examples we conducted human evaluation studies to validate our experimental design and demonstrate human level marization performance on xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu related work dai le ramachandran et al used lm and autoencoder pre training on in domain data to improve formance of rnn sequence models however the tion of pre training with much larger external text corpora such as wikipedia books or web pages and based sequence models has led to a dramatic improvement in performance when ne tuned for both natural language derstanding and text generation tasks radford et al devlin et al rothe et al yang et al joshi et al song et al dong et al lewis et al most similar to our approach are transformer encoder decoder models pre trained on some masked input pre training objective mass song et al proposed masked sequence sequence generation that reconstructs a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence a single sentence fragment was randomly selected unilm dong et al proposed jointly training on three types of language modeling tasks unidirectional to right and right to left bidirectional word level mask pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization with next sentence prediction and sequence to sequence word level mask prediction however such a procedure would only train a model to copy sentences thus not suitable for abstractive summarization raffel et al generalized the text to text work to a variety of nlp tasks and showed the advantage of scaling up model size to billion parameters and pre training corpus introducing a massive text corpus derived from common crawl which we also use in some of our models was pre trained with randomly corrupted text spans of varying mask ratios and sizes of spans bart lewis et al introduced a denoising coder to pre train sequence to sequence models bart corrupted text with an arbitrary noising function and learned to reconstruct the original text for generation tasks the noising function was text inlling which used single mask tokens to mask random sampled spans of text in contrast to mass unilm bart and the proposed pegasus masks multiple whole sentences rather than smaller continuous text spans in our nal objective we deterministically choose sentences based on importance rather than randomly as in pegasus does not struct full input sequences and only generates the masked sentences as a single output sequence in this work we focus entirely on downstream summarization generative tasks and do not evaluate on nlu classication tasks there has been some work on the low resource rization setting using the cnn dailymail dataset radford et al showed that a large transformer language model pre trained on web text could generate summaries if prompted with achieving a of on cnn dailymail khandelwal et al pre trained a transformer language model on wikipedia and ne tuned using examples achieving inspired by recent success in masking words and contiguous spans joshi et al raffel et al we select and mask whole sentences from documents and concatenate the gap sentences into a pseudo summary the corresponding position of each selected gap sentence is replaced by a mask token to inform the model gap sentences ratio or gsr refers to the number of selected gap sentences to the total number of sentences in the document which is similar to mask rate in other works to even more closely approximate a summary we select sentences that appear to be important principal to the ument the resulting objective has both the empirically demonstrated benets of masking and anticipates the form of the downstream task we consider primary strategies for selecting m gap tences without replacement from a document d comprised of n sentences random uniformly select m sentences at random lead select the rst m sentences principal select top m scored sentences according to portance as a proxy for importance we compute lin between the sentence and the rest of the document d xi i in this formulation sentences are scored independently ind and the top m selected we also consider selecting them sequentially seq as in nallapati et al by greedily maximizing the between selected sentences s xi and remaining sentences d s xi as in algorithm pre training objectives algorithm sequential sentence selection we propose a new pre training objective gsg in this work but for comparison we also evaluate bert s language model objective in isolation and in conjunction with gsg gap sentences generation gsg we hypothesize that using a pre training objective that more closely resembles the downstream task leads to better and faster ne tuning performance given our intended use for abstractive summarization our proposed pre training tive involves generating summary like text from an input document in order to leverage massive text corpora for training we design a sequence to sequence self supervised objective in the absence of abstactive summaries a naive option would be to pre train as an extractive summarizer s xi d s xi s for j to m do rouge i s t s k arg s s xk end for when calculating we also consider n grams as a set uniq instead of double counting identical n grams as in the original implementation orig this results in four variants of the principal sentence selection strategy choosing ind seq and orig uniq options an example containing lead random and principal gap tence

sole pre training tive or along with gsg when mlm is the sole pre training objective the transformer decoder shares all parameters with encoder when ne tuning on downstream tasks ing rothe et al figure simultaneously shows how both gsg and mlm are applied to the same example when used in conjunction however we found that mlm does not improve stream tasks at large number of pre training steps

large model all experiments hyper parameters can be found in pendix c and reported numbers are in appendix d and e ablations on pegasusbase we used pegasusbase to evaluate choices of pre training

khandelwal et al with examples qualitative observations and human evaluation overall we observed high linguistic quality in terms of ency and coherence closely emulating the style of truth summaries while some previous work suggested that maximum likelihood training results in repetitive text in model outputs welleck et al we found this to be rare in our outputs and did not require additional measures to mitigate although rouge clearly has its draw backs kryscinski et al over penalizing abstractive approaches pared to extractive ones and having no sense of tic quality we found that choosing perplexity optimized models using aggregated rouge rather than directly timizing rouge as in paulus et al resulted in qualitatively good models randomly sampled by a gram model decodes across all datasets and a broad range of rouge scores can be found in appendix i we found that even low rouge model summaries often were quality figure g to assess how close pegasuslarge is to human mance we conducted human evaluation experiments on amazon mechanical turk comparing model summaries with human reference summaries given the input document the examples were drawn from the xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu datasets the rst two were chosen due to their popularity in past work and the third was chosen for its signicant difference in style workers were asked to rate the summaries on a scale

training corpora are a large collection of documents from the internet and potentially have overlap with the stream test sets in this section we measured the extent of overlap between the pre training corpus and downstream datasets we also studied if the pre trained model was able to exploit memorization to achieve higher performance on the downstream datasets to measure the overlap we calculated similarities between all pairs of downstream test set targets and pre training documents we use the recall as a similarity measure common grams test set targets grams it is not necessarily exact match even if the similarity score is we ltered all test set examples that have similarity to any pre training example above a threshold and recalculated the rouge scores on the remaining test set in figure we conducted this study on the pre training and test set of xsum cnn dailymail reddit tifu and wikihow with a similarity threshold of and results show that only xsum has signicant amount of overlap to

out on mice and pigs reveals the protein infused patch encourages the growth of healthy cells and leads to less scarring scarring can be common after a heart attack making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail writing in the journal nature researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment during an attack muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood ow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long term damage in this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels while showing signs of pumping more effectively prof pilar ruiz lozano at stanford university which has patented the patch said many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation the hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage commenting on the study in nature prof gordana vunjak novakovic at columbia university said the work could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction but she cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans a prototype patch could help the repair the damage caused by a heart attack scientists say scientists say they have developed a synthetic patch that can repair damaged hearts after a heart attack around countries are expected to

for tackling rising temperatures but some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a distraction despite the absence of president obama around world leaders are expected here at un headquarters including french president francois hollande and prime minister trudeau from canada but their signatures alone will not be enough to make the paris agreement operational the legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratication for some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the united states others though such as india and japan will have to take the document to their parliaments some may need new laws the european union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually some countries including the marshall islands palau fiji and switzerland have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on april to become operational the treaty needs at least countries representing at least of global emissions to complete all the steps while this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible firstly president obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes ofce

administration and the delivery of council services he told bbc radio gloucestershire a few weeks ago we would expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders exactly as now so if there s a crime in cirencester gloucestershire police attend and if there s a burglary in burford thames valley police attend but gloucestershire s pcc martin surl said he had taken legal advice on the

but with the good comes the bad the taller you are the higher your odds of developing cancer and a new paper has added weight to this key points key points taller people have more cells in their body as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow for every cm over the average height a person s risk for cancer increases per cent new analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this and also nds a few specic cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height leonard nunney an evolutionary biologist at the university of california riverside looked at massive cancer databases to nd out how the number of cells in a person s body using height as a proxy might affect their risk of developing cancer reporting in the proceedings of the royal society b he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall for every centimetres over the average height the risk of developing any cancer increased by around per cent this ts with previous studies if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board professor nunney said he also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma and women specically had greater odds of developing thyroid cancer but it does nt mean tall people should panic now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware a new study on cancer wo nt make for pleasant reading for tall people consider this quote from lead researcher leonard nunney of the university of california riverside if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board he tells australia s abc yes nunney s study in the proceedings of the royal society b suggests that taller people are at greater risk for cancer the surprisingly simple reason they have more cells and thus more things go can wrong in those cells explains the guardian specically the study found that cancer risk rises by for every inches people are above average feet for women and feet for men reports cnn the ndings held true for of cancers studied now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this and if they have any concerns to get checked says nunney cancers of the colon and kidney were among those with the strongest correlation to height a researcher not involved with the study says it backs up previously seen links between height and cancer taller people are more likely to develop cancer than shorter people according to a new study the study published in the proceedings of the royal society b found that for every centimeters over the average height of a person the risk of developing cancer increases by if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board leonard nunney an evolutionary biologist at the university of california riverside tells australia s news network the study also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma thyroid cancer and cervical cancer now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this and if they have any concerns to get checked nunney says it just suggests more vigilance i think one theory is that taller people have more cells in their bodies which encourages them to grow but nunney also found that cancers in the skin stomach and mouth were more closely linked to height across other cancers there s no real

streptomycin and tetracycline source world skeletons dug up in london last year are indeed the remains of people who died from the black plagueand who suffered a tough life before falling ill the bbc

of where the photographs were taken when photographer paul nicklen and lmmakers from conservation group sea legacy arrived on somerset islandnear the larger bafn islandin the canadian arctic in late summer they came across a heartbreaking sight a starving polar bear on its deathbed nicklen is no stranger to bears from the time he was a child growing up in canada s far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over bears in the wild but the emaciated polar bear featured in videos nicklen published to social media on december was one of the most gut wrenching sights he s ever seen we stood there cryinglming with tears rolling down our cheeks he said video shows the polar bear clinging to life its white hair limply covering its thin bony frame one of the bear s back legs drags behind it as it walks likely due to muscle atrophy looking for food the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by inuit shers it nds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground in the days since nicklen posted the footage he s been asked why he did nt intervene of course that crossed my mind said nicklen but it s not like i walk around with a tranquilizer gun or pounds of seal meat and even if he did said nicklen he only would have been prolonging the bear s misery plus feeding wild polar bears an estimated billion people saw the image a starving polar bear struggling across an arctic landscape the mission was a success but there was a problem we had lost control of the narrative writes cristina mittermeier in national geographic accompanied by a photographic team she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague paul nicklen shot videoall part of their mission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change she writes when paul posted the video on instagram he wrote this is what starvation looks like he also wondered if all polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint but he did nt say climate change had killed this bear that nuance vanished when national geographic posted the video with the subtitles this is what climate change looks like and the washington post ran a dramatic headline about gut wrenching images people also responded dramatically expressing gratitude for validation of climate science anger the crew had nt fed the bear or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we did nt know what

customer card details and process payments these are often dened by your own technical expertise it could mean providing a simple means of redirecting customers from your site to their hosted payment pages or maybe you require a way for you to authorise payments remotely whatever your requirement a dedicated psp should have the solutions to meet it one size does not t all so do nt let anyone persuade you otherwise a xed monthly fee starts at around but there are some cheaper options available starting as low as per transaction as a rule of thumb the higher your transaction volume the lower the unit cost and remember to compare like with like ask if its a complete solution with inclusive fees or whether you ll be paying the bank separately on top of that will the psp with those oh so attractive prices charge huge set up fees for enabling services such as deferred payments a virtual terminal or subscriptions that come as standard with other psps look beyond the headline gures and consider the overall long term operational cost of partnering with each psp for example does the psp have limited support for fraud management the cost of imsy security could do much more damage to your bottom line than any fractional differences in rates as an online merchant you need to make sure you can also manage them as efciently as possible which is why an effective psp should provide you with the right reporting and administration tools to manage your merchant services will you have access to real time transaction statements can you export valuable customer data is the reporting sophisticated enough to allow you to answer questions that can better target future sales for enquire about their technical solutions technically your psp must be capable of supporting all of your plans look for genuinely competitive rates costs set up fees and cost per transaction can vary greatly between competing psps so you need to shop around for the best rates establish if there are any upfront costs the real costs associated with accepting online card payments do not start and end at the rate quote manage reporting and administration facilities accepting online payments is only one part of the e commerce equation enquire about their technical support a service is not a service unless its fully backed up find out if you would be protected against fraud when accepting card payments online fraud is potentially the biggest threat to your prots make sure you can trust their services online the difference between a prospect and a customer is trust look out for a full service history okay its not a car but the principle is the same establish what your psp needs to do to meet the needs of your online merchant business look at the pricing offered by the psp consider the level of support you ll get from the psp look at the tools you ll be using to manage your merchant services consider the need for fraud management systems pms there s no doubt that the quality of a psps fraud solution will depend upon its support for merchant services solutions in other words its ability to meet the needs of your online merchant business check the reliability of the psps

the customer has left the cart so when the customer comes out the bottom door of the ghost train they are about a ft gap away from due to the space for the other carts to take up because of this i try to make them leave their cart asap to prevent another coming out and crashing into them and some times i ll press the button to control that cart just a tad to move it so they get the idea to move out

i got that they keep popping up all over my body i then proceeded to show him bruises on my arms i was trying to climb trees whilst drunk over the weekend as a cover up boss became concerned and said i need to see a doctor right away as it could be something more serious like leukemia he has given me next monday off to see the doctor girl attacked my neck boss sent me to the doctor went out with a

were playing with nerf guns shooting eachother around the house being older and more experienced with weapons i got him good quite a few times and we were having a great time his family had bought some knock off nerf darts that seemed like a great deal until they arrived and had solid tips so instead of feeling like a mild ick these feel like a very strong ick now so far these darts had caused no real injuries just a bit more pain than your average nerf dart then i foolishly decided to bring out the big guns namely a pipe i used as a blowgun that was the perfect diameter for nerf darts i have used blowguns for a good few years and am pretty good with them in both accuracy and power so i knew to regulate my power when shooting at people it was still more powerful so in an attempt to draw my re and catch me ammoless my cousin held a cowboy hat out from behind a doorway for me to shoot exactly like in a western so seeing as i m shooting an innanimate object i took a deep breath and lined up my shot i could see my other even younger cousin female in the background watching me but due to my blowgun experience i assumed she d be ne so i let this breath go and instead of the thump of it hitting the hat my cousin crumples and runs outside crying i follow her and she is crying and saying i shot her and her eye is blurry and its not getting better she was being very brave given the context and i tried to console and reassure her it d be ne so gold model while playing nerf with one cousin i accidentally shot another in the eye causing her iris to bleed which if jerked too

like the wigner function xcite and the husimi kano function xcite the diagonal representation of quantum states was suggested in xcite see also xcite it was studied and applied in xcite in this representation a quantum state is represented in terms of weighted sum of coherent state projectors the properties of all the quantum state representations considered are associated with the properties of the density operator which is hermitian trace class nonnegative operator this means in particular that all the eigenvalues of the density operators must be nonnegative in the quantum domain the multipartite systems have a specic property connected with strong correlations of the quantum subsystems this property provides the entanglement phenomenon xcite in the diagonal representation of the density states the weight function is an analog of the probability distribution function in the phase space for some class of states this function is identical to the probability distribution function like in classical statistical mechanics in xcite the tomographic probability representation of quantum states where the quantum state is associated with the so called symplectic

relatives of affected men have a fold increased risk of pca when or more rst degree relatives are affected or at least rst degree relatives before the age of years the family is considered a hereditary prostate cancer hpc family according to the so called johns hopkins or carter criteria yet only a few very rare high penetrance gene mutations have been identied to cause hpc in recent years genome wide association studies have added approximately low penetrance genetic polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of pca several polymorphisms have also been identied that are associated with serum prostate specic antigen psa the most commonly used marker for early detection of pca an ongoing matter of debate is whether psa testing should be used for population wide screening in a population based setting the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer erspc showed a decrease in pca mortality of in the screening arm after correction for non attendance and contamination by contrast the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial plco found no effect of psa screening on mortality but suffered from methodological problems

structural characteristics or loss of structural integrity due to the electrolytic capabilities of saliva various types of brackets are commercially available and each demonstrates a unique pattern of corrosion in soldered brackets this corrosion is due to the presence of dissimilar metals i e the silver solder and the stainless steel a phenomenon termed galvanic corrosion metal injection molding mim brackets are manufactured as a single unit and therefore do not demonstrate galvanic corrosion corrosion can have detrimental effects on the surface of stainless steel brackets due to the continuous loss of metal ions corrosion can increase the surface roughness of the bracket which leads to elevated friction forces between the bracket and the archwire this increase in friction results in unfavorable distribution of forces and reduces the effectiveness of archwire guided orthodontic tooth movement moreover by means of increased stress the friction would further accelerate the corrosion process the release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this eld among these metal ions furthermore direct and prolonged contact of orthodontic appliances and the resulting corrosion products have been shown to cause local pain and statement of the problem stainless steel brackets release metallic ions following the

individuals and their families alongside the sizeable burden on employers health care systems and society in general when chronic pain occurs it has the potential to become disease itself and subsequently chronic pain has emerged as a distinct phenomenon management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even within nations literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care although various health care systems may not always support this concept consistently the current standard of care for chronic noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions pharmacology and psychological and physical therapies opioid analgesics are often prescribed despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting their long term use in the management of chronic pain however for many patients this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable and debilitating only at this late stage the eld of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost years ago the original term of dorsal column stimulation has evolved to become known as spinal cord stimulation scs scs has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic nociceptive and neuropathic radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome fbss and complex regional pain syndrome crps neuromodulation therapies offer a treatment option that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and spinal cord stimulation scs applications and technologies are fast advancing new scs technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical environment but often there is a lag period between the clinical application and the publishing of high quality evidence on safety and efcacy recent developments will undoubtedly expand the applicability of scs allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients and may have the potential to salvage patients who have previously failed neuromodulation already high level evidence exists for the safety efcacy and cost effectiveness level i ii of traditional scs therapies in the treatment of chronic refractory low back with predominant limb pain regardless of surgical history more than half of all patients with chronic painful conditions experience sustained and signicant levels of pain reduction following scs treatment although only limited evidence exists for burst stimulation there is now level i evidence for both dorsal root ganglion scs and high frequency scs that
