conduct sive experiments on summarization datasets our analysis provides evidence that ing is a promising avenue of research towards future summarization introduction a summary is reliable only if it is true to original abstractive summarizers are considered to be less reliable despite their impressive performance on benchmark datasets because they can hallucinate facts and struggle to keep the original meanings tact kryscinski et al lebanoff et al in this paper we seek to generate summary lights to be overlaid on the original documents to allow summaries to be understood in context and avoid misdirecting readers to false conclusions this is especially important in areas involving islation political speeches public policies social media and more sadeh et al kornilova and eidelman highlighting is most commonly used in education to make important information stand out and bring attention of readers to the sential topics rello et al original document and summary highlights afghan opium kills people every year worldwide more than any other drug and the opiate heroin kills ve times as many people in nato countries each year than the eight year total of nato troops killed in afghan combat the united nations said wednesday about million people around the world use heroin opium or morphine fueling a billion market for the drug and also fueling terrorism and insurgencies drug money is funding insurgencies in central asia which has huge energy reserves costa said europe and russia together consume just under half of the heroin coming out of afghanistan the united nations concluded and iran is by far the single largest consumer of afghan opium table an example of sub sentence highlights overlaid on the original document the highlights are self contained the characteristics of summary highlights are saliency i e highlights must give the main points of the documents and non redundancy suggesting that redundant content should not appear in a mary nenkova and mckeown importantly a highlighted text should be self contained i e derstandable on its own without the need for cic information from surrounding context table provides an example of sub sentence highlights in contrast new jersey is located in hardly tutes a good highlight because the information it contains is incomplete and may confuse readers to date there has not been any unied framework to account for all these characteristics to generate highlights we overcome the challenge by fying self contained sub sentence segments from the documents then combining determinantal point processes and deep contextualized representations to produce highlights determinantal point process belongs to a class of optimization methods that have had considerable success in summarizing text and video kulesza and taskar gong et al sharghi et al it selects a diverse subset from a ground set of items where an item is a candidate text segment in the context of generating summary highlights an item is characterized by a quality score that dicates the salience of the segment and a diversity t c o l c s c v v i x r a score that models pairwise repulsion suggesting that two segments carrying similar meaning can not both be included in the summary to avoid dancy the quality and diversity decomposition of dpp allows it to identify an optimal subset from a collection of candidate segments we study sub sentence segments as they strike a balance between the quality and amount of lights whole sentences often contain excessive or unwanted details keywords are succinct but less informative we conjecture that sub sentence ments can be identied from a document similar to salient objects are identied from an image ing bounding boxes girshick et al to best estimate the size of segments we present a novel method to overgenerate a rich set of contained partially overlapping sub sentence ments from any sentence based on contextualized representations yang et al devlin et al then leverage determinantal point processes to identify an essential subset based on saliency and non redundancy criteria our contributions of this work are summarized as follows we propose to generate sub sentence summary highlights to be overlaid on source documents to enable users to quickly navigate through content comparing to keywords or whole sentences sentence segments allow us to attain a good ance between quality and amount of highlights importantly sub sentence segments are designed to be self contained and for which we introduce a new algorithm based on deep contextual sentations to obtain self contained text segments all candidate segments are fed to tal point processes to identify an optimal subset containing informative non redundant and contained sub sentence highlights we perform experiments on benchmark rization datasets to demonstrate the exibility and modeling power of our approach our ysis provides further evidence that highlighting offers a promising avenue of research

summaries can lead the readers to false conclusions cao et al falke et al lebanoff et al we aim to produce summary highlights in this paper which will be overlaid on source documents to allow maries to be interpreted in context generation of summary highlights is of crucial importance to tasks such as producing informative snippets from search outputs kaisser et al summarizing viewpoints in opinionated text paul et al amplayo and lapata and notating website privacy policies to assist users in answering important questions sadeh et al determining the most appropriate textual unit for highlighting however has been an understudied problem extractive summarization selects whole sentences from documents a sentence can tain to words on average kamigaito et al keyphrases containing two to three words are much less informative hasan and ng neither are ideal solutions there is a rising need for other forms of highlighting and we explore sentence highlights that strike a balance between the amount and quality of emphasized content it is best for highlighted segments to remain contained in fact multiple partially overlapping and self contained segments can exist in a sentence as illustrated in table identifying self contained segments has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies woodsend and lapata pose to generate story highlights by selecting and combining phrases li et al explore tary discourse units generated using an rst parser as selection units spala et al present a crowdsourcing method for workers to highlight tences and compare systems arumae et al propose to align human abstracts and source cles to create ground truth highlight annotations importantly and distinguishing our work from lier literature we make a rst attempt to generate self contained highlights drawing on the successes of deep contextualized representations and their extraordinary ability of encoding syntactic ture clark et al hewitt and manning we next discuss our method in greater detail our method we present a new method to identify self contained segments then select important and non redundant segments to form a summary as text fragments taining incomplete and disorganized information are hardly successful summary highlights self contained segments a self contained segment is in a sense a miniature sentence any text segment containing incomplete or ungrammatical constructions is ble to humans table presents examples of contained and non self contained segments since its very inception vladutz the concept of semantically self contained segment has not been sufciently examined in the literature and lacks an universal denition we assume in this paper that a self contained segment shall conform to certain syntactic validity constraints and there exists only weak dependencies between words that belong to the segment and those do not the automatic identication of self contained segments requires more than segmentation or ing sentences into tree structures dozat and ning self contained segments do not sarily correspond to constituents of the tree and ther there is no guarantee that tree constituents are self contained in this paper we dene a segment to be a consecutive sequence of words excluding segments formed by concatenating non adjacent words from consideration we perform exhaustive search to analyze every segment of a given sentence to determine if it is self contained or not let xn be a document sentence we present a method to estimate whether an trary segment j of the sentence is semantically self contained or not our method is inspired by figure the xlnet architecture with two stream attention mechanism is leveraged to estimate whether a segment is contained or not a self contained segment is assumed to be preceded and followed by end of sentence markers eos xlnet yang et al that introduces a novel architecture with two stream attention mechanism for autoregressive language modeling pretrained contextualized representations such as bert and xlnet have demonstrated remarkable success on language understanding tasks we expect the sentations to encode the syntactic validity of ments as similar ndings are seen in recent tural probings hewitt and manning we hypothesize that a self contained segment similar to a miniature sentence can be preceded and followed by end of sentence eos markers without sacricing grammatical correctness we follow the convention of clark et al to ne end of sentence markers eos to include ods and commas our method inserts hypothetical tokens xs and xe to the beginning and end tions of a segment then constructs ized representations for these positions denoted by pstart and pend based on which we estimate how likely xs is an end of sentence marker similarly for their average probability indicates self containedness a higher score of j suggests xi has a higher likelihood of being self contained pstart pstart it is important to induce contextualized tations for the augmented segment without using the content of hypothetical tokens xs and xe we leverage xlnet with two stream attention anism for this purpose as illustrated in figure for the k th position start end of the l th l layer a content stream builds representation h masked two stream attentionmasked two stream streamquery stream figure dpp selects a set of summary segments marked yellow based on the quality and pairwise dissimilarity of segments by attending to all tokens of the segment whereas a query stream builds representation g taneously without incorporating the content of the current token xk following the equations given low our method builds on the pretrained xlnet model without ne tuning it relies on two stream attention to construct deep contextualized tations pstart and pend respectively for the beginning and end positions l h h l g g kv h kv h i i our method is the rst attempt to extract tically self contained segments from whole tences segments that do not resemble miniature sentences will be given low probabilities by the method e closed and hundreds of ights have been is scored low not only because an end sentence marker rarely occurs after have been but also the syntactic structure of the segment does not resemble that of a well formed sentence we split a sentence at punctuation and extract a number of segments from each sentence chunk a segment is discarded if its start or end probability is lower than the upper quartile value indicating an inappropriate start or end point the ing segments are ordered according to the average probability this process produces a collection of self contained and partially overlapping segments from a set of documents next we assess the formativeness of the segments and leverage dpp to identify a subset to form the summary highlights segment selection with dpp we employ the modeling framework proposed by cho et al for modeling determinantal point processes dpp kulesza and taskar denes a probability measure p over all subsets of a ground set containing a collection of n segments y n the probability of an tive summary containing a subset of the segments y y is dened by eq where det is the determinant of a matrix l rnn is a positive semi denite matrix and lij indicates the tion between segments i and j ly is a submatrix of l containing only entries indexed by elements in y i is the identity matrix this denition gests that the probability of a summary l is proportional to the determinant of ly l i log p y i n a decomposition exists for the l ensemble trix lij sij qj where qi is a quality score of the i th segment and sij is a pairwise ilarity score between segments i and j if q and s are available can be computed using eq estimating the pairwise similarity s is trivial we refer the reader to cho et al for details in this paper we present a inverted pyramid method to estimate the quality of segments q the quality model is parameterized by thus the l ensemble is parameterized the same denoted by for the i th instance of the dataset y i represents the ground truth summary eq the model is timized by maximizing the log likelihood where parameters are learned during training as trated in figure dpp allows us to identify a set of salient and non redundant summary segments inverted pyramid we describe a classier to dict if a segment of text is summary worthy or not according to the inverted pyramid principle it is a way of front loading a story so that the reader can get the most important information rst e the most newsworthy information such as who what

the bottom paragraph of a news article which usually contains trivial details importantly the classier is trained using cnn dm see et al rather than any multi document summarization data during training we obtain the ground truth mary of each article a summary sentence is paired with the lead paragraph of the article that contains the sentences to form a positive instance and similarly with sentences to form a tive instance if a summary sentence appears as is in the top or bottom paragraph we exclude the tence from the paragraph to avoid overtting the classier at test time the classier learns to distill the essential content of the segment and assigns a high score to it if its content is similar to the lead paragraph indicating the segment is relevant and summary worthy for each instance we obtain deep contextualized representation for it using the bert architecture where a segment and a lead or bottom paragraph is used as the input and the top layer hidden vector of the cls token is extracted as the representation it is fed to a feedforward a dropout and a softmax layer to predict a binary label for the segment once the model is trained we apply it to a segment and its lead paragraph to produce a vector which is used as part of the features for computing q dpp training we obtain feature representations for the i th segment by concatenating the previous vector and a

afford to have human annotators to label a large number of segments we introduce an approximation method instead first we greedily select a set of summary sentences from a document set that achieve

total segments per document set summary segments per document set words per tree segment tree segments per sentence total segments per document set summary segments per document set table statistics of text segments generated by xlnet and the constituent parse tree method on duc tac datasets collect text segments governed by the subtrees an illustration is shown in figure constituent parse trees are obtained using the stanford parser ning et al in both cases the segments are passed to dpp which identies a set of important and non redundant segments as highlights as shown in tables and we nd both ods to perform competitively with state of the art extractive and abstractive systems while producing summary segments with simpler structure our xlnetsegs method achieves the highest scores on and it performs comparable to other tems on it is important to note that ing a sentence into smaller segments dramatically increases the search space making it a challenging task to accurately identify summary segments yet extracting segments remains necessary as whole sentences may contain excessive and unwanted tails the degree of difculty involved in ing sub sentence highlights is thus beyond that of sentence selection a similar nding is reported by cheng and lapata table presents a direct comparison of xlnet and tree segments on duc and tac datasets we nd that xlnet segments are

worst to best and we report their average scores human evaluation suggests that text segments generated by our model demonstrate a high degree of self containedness self containedness we perform further analysis to investigate the tiveness of our method on generating self contained segments it is impractical to create a standard by asking human annotators to judge all available sentence segments as the number of ments is polynomial in sentence length instead we perform post hoc evaluation on segments erated by our xlnet algorithm which are used as input to dpp we sample topics from extract sentences from each document for a tal of sentences and system generated segments a human annotator is given the original sentence and its segments and asked to score each segment on a likert scale of worst to best for self containedness a likert scale is necessary to accommodate potentially ambiguous cases we employ human annotators to judge each segment their average scores are reported in table we observe that of segments have an average score of have a score and receive the full score the human annotators are able to achieve a moderate level of agreement the standard deviation of their scores is of the segments have their majority score agreed by three or more annotators table presents example segments and their human assessment scores more in supplementary while our summary highlights figure absolute position of the whole sentence among all segments sorted by xlnet scores of self containedness tree segments a tree segment contains tokens on average while an xlnet segment contains tokens on both methods produce a large number of candidate segments ranging from to segments per document set with only to ground truth summary segments per document set the small ratio poses a substantial challenge for dpp not only must it identify salient content but it has to accurately identify the segments worthy of being included in the summary in table we show example highlights produced by both ods more examples are in supplementary segments generated by xlnet are sorted ing to their scores of self containedness in table we provide examples of segments and their scores the higher the score the more likely the segment resembles a miniature sentence we are particularly interested in understanding where the original sentence is placed according to xlnet scores results are shown in figure we observe that in of the cases the original sentence is placed among the candidates suggesting the effectiveness of the xlnet model as segments are shorter and occur more often in natural language texts it is possible that they are considered more self contained than the original sentence segments extracted from subtrees are sorted by the depth of tree nodes the higher nodes are mative constituents denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses hwa an important caveat of the tree segments is their lack of coverage e people died is a valid self contained segment but it does not belong to a tree constituent as seen in figure given that drawback we focus on segments created by xlnet in our experiments propositions from a given sentence is beyond the scope of this paper as proposition structures given by openie banko et al or props stanovsky et al are often not consecutive segments of text instead they are presented as relation tuples or directed graphs highlighting the proposition structures can cause hundreds of small text chunks to be highlighted in the documents which may result in undesirable visual effects have been evaluated using both standard automatic metrics for assessing the informativeness of the summary and human assessment for judging the well formedness of individual segments we hope to explore other methods in future work ing human evaluation of highlights for the entire document set the task is nontrivial it requires a well designed intuitive graphical user interface for evaluators to read through all source documents
