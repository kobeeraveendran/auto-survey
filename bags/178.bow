contents preface the book is a summary of various lectures on nonperturbative qcd which i has given during the last three decades at stony brook it is about the topological objects present in gauge theories their semiclassical theory and applications to multiple physical phenomena the overall content of the book can be grasped from the list of chapters and sections below so let me mention here at the start what is dierent in this book relative to others there are good classic reviews books and lecture notes on magnetic monopoles and instantons yet those about dyons sphalerons and even such traditional object as qcd ux tubes are yet to be found even for subjects on which there is extensive pedagogic style literature they all have rather dierent focus usually these objects topological solitons as one can call them collectively are treated individually it can be compared to a visit to a zoo here is a lion and here is a gazelle of course we will have similar individual discussion of all these objects below as well but the focus will be on their ensembles and phenomena which such objects generate collectively think of it as an actual trip to african savannas for ple at some settings such solitons can exist in nite cluster or groups and in another in innite scaled as volume condensates under certain conditions monopoles undergo bose einstein condensation related to connement deconnement phase transitions instantons lead to quark pairing and condensation breaking neously the chiral symmetry this leads to eective quark mass and therefore large fraction of the nucleon s mass as well as our own sphalerons lead to chiral balance in heavy ion collisions and in early universe producing also sounds gravity waves and perhaps even the baryon asymmetry the semiclassical models of all these phenomena have also strong roots in the rst principle numerical approach to gauge theories known as lattice gauge theories for all of these objects observations of them on the lattice and verication of their collective eects would also be the important part of many chapters below crucial feature of modern eld string theories is a notion of dualities namely existence of dierent yet physically equivalent descriptions we will discuss three of those i the famed electric magnetic duality the poisson duality e between monopoles and instanton dyons as well as the holographic gauge string or ads cft duality discovery of each duality is always a surprise complemented with original disbelief then some confusion and nally multiple tests this make internal logic of a book a bit complex since some chapters are dual to others let me illustrate the situation for poisson duality much less known than the others it tells us that the partition function and of course everything else stemming from dyons but the it using monopoles looks very dierent from that using instanton results are the same therefore one should either use one or the other formulation not their sum or other combination they are just two dierent ways of organizing evaluation of the same path inntegral march wspc book trim size for in in allinone contents chapter introduction what are

allinone chapter introduction what are the nonperturbative topological phenomena in quantum eld theory qft courses one rst learns about weakly coupled eld theories such as quantum electrodynamics and perturbative qcd they start with harmonic oscillator quantization quanta of the elds and their weak action described by feynman expanding the partition sum of a theory represented by some path integral in powers of the coupling one get results which schematically looks like this is assumed to be small enough to make series convergent in some where s practical the coecients cn are calculated functions of the kinematical parameters e products of momenta of in and out going quanta this approach was created in s in quantum electrodynamics qed the corresponding is small serving as a natural small parameter of the perturbation theory in non abelian gauge theories such as qcd the coupling constant is running it depends on the momentum scale involved the course feynman diagrams have now much wider than qft range of applications readers interested in the easiest introduction to feynman diagrams can nd it in my textbook manybody theory in the nutshell princeton university press where they are explained using basic toy models from quantum statistical mechanics these series are known to be divergent or asymptotic several its terms approach certain limit at suciently small s before divergent away from it in higher order general issues related with perturbative series we will discuss in connection to the so called transseries later will use now standard high energy physics units showing them explicitly only in few cases such as this one for more on units and notations see appendix n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction pling is small at large momentum transfer hard processes perturbative qcd pqcd also uses feynman diagrams but we will not discuss any of that in these lectures the most important perturbatively calculated function is the beta tion of the renormalization group which is discussed in the appendix another perturbatively calculated quantity we will need is the eective action created by quantum uctuations for constant classical also given in appendix these lectures are not about feynman diagrams and perturbation theory but about nonperturbative phenomena unfortunately the word nonperturbative pearing in the book s title is used in literature with several dierent meanings the weakest of them is a situation in which the perturbative series are re summed sometimes the sum is simpler than each diagram by itself this for example happen integer power of s the most important re summation will if the answer is non be that given by renormalization group rg gell mann law beta function however in this book we adopt stronger meaning of the term namely we will call nonperturbative any phenomena which are in the perturbative context what it means is exemplied by a function of the coupling like this exp const s attempting to expand it in powers of the coupling one nds that all coecients of its taylor expansion are zero the exponential term and the perturbative series build on it are derived by the semiclassical methods which we will study all exponential perturbative and logarithmic not shown terms together form the so called relations between coecients bn and cn of if found are called resurgence relations the topological phenomena are related to existence of topological solitons made of so strong elds that the interaction non quadratic parts of lagrangian is as large as quadratic ones in the case of gauge theories it means aa g specically we will discuss i instantons and their constituents instanton dyons ii sphalerons unstable magnetic balls and their explosions iii magnetic monopoles iv conning electric ux tubes also known as the qcd strings as interesting as those objects are by themselves as some mathematical ties we will be mostly interested in what they can do to help us to understand the world around us to mention a standard textbook style sentence therefore speaking they are visible via the so called dyson phenomena explaining why the turbative series are asymptotic badly divergent series curious reader may wander if exponent log and powers do form together a suciently complete set the answer to it is armative march wspc book trim size for in in allinone what are the nonperturbative topological phenomena let me mention on the onset why we are going to study them instantons are dimensional solitons historically important as evidence of tunneling phenomena existing not only in quantum mechanical systems like nuclear decays but in qft as well in gauge theories especially they also were the rst objects for which semiclassical approximation was used in the qft instantons also are very important in qcd because their fermionic zero modes generate non trivial interaction between light quarks in qcd or quarks and tons in electroweak theory if instantons are present in large enough density this eective multi quark forces are strong enough to form the so called quark condensate this does happen in the qcd vacuum we leave in making near massless u d s quarks look like objects with an eective mass m ev so instantons are responsible for signicant fraction of the nucleon mass and thus our mass as well this alone means that they deserve to be studied quark condensate melts at in qcd t t the so called temperature of the chiral symmetry restoration with physical quarks both are close t tc m ev another important phenomenon in qcd at nite temperatures is deconf inement both transitions seem to happen at the same temperature this however seems to be monopoles are d solitons made of the gauge and scalar elds with nonzero magnetic charges they are bosons and their ensemble can undergo bose einstein condensation in qcd this happens below some temperature tc their condensate expells the color electric eld into conning electric ux tubes that is why tc is called the deconf inement temperature above it the matter is quark gluon plasma qgp sphalerons like monopoles are magnetic d solutions to yang mills tions unlike monopoles their magnetic eld goes in circles and so they lack magnetic charge although they satisfy yang mills equation they are not i m a of the action but only saddle points therefore they are unstable and with small perturbation can explode along the so called sphaleron path congurations the explosion itself allows for analytic solution and we will study it in sphaleron chapter while sphalerons are important both in qcd and electroweak theory we will discuss them mostly in the context of cosmological electroweak phase tions ewpt since they violate the baryon lepton numbers conservation and are generic semiclassical objects called uctons were also developed and will be discussed in chapter we did not list them above since they are not generally topological and their role in qfts is not worked out in detail so far we know this because some deformations of qcd does split them signicantly and even make them of dierent transition order march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction suspect to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe certain properties of hadronic amplitudes and spectrum lead to the idea that quarks in the qcd vacuum are connected by the qcd strings studies of fective string description led to creation of the string theory but we will not go in this direction below instead we will discuss their structure interactions and in general their role in strong interaction physics the main applications we will sider are inter quark conning potentials closely related to pomerons and reggeons the somewhat mysterious objects which emerged in s from phenomenology of hadronic scattering we will of course have a look at modern lattice and mental data as well as some modern derivation of the pomeron amplitude let un now return to perturbative phenomena for a moment a re summation of certain sequence of diagrams can lead to properties of new quasiparticles tive excitations even more advance theory can be based on the tion group the calculations may start in weak coupling and lead to xed points they may also indicate coupling ow to strong coupling and explain existence of qualitatively new phases of the theory a classic example is the bcs theory of superconductivity weak phonon induced attraction between electrons get stronger near the fermi surface till nally it become strong enough to form cooper pairs qcd like gauge theories we will discuss also posess the asymptotic freedom in the uv high momenta small distances the coupling is weak to one loop accuracy their coupling runs according to phenomenon log qcd the he rst one loop coecient in the r s of the beta function give depends on the number of colors nc and light quark avors nf it will always be positive in this course so the number of fermions would be limited substitution of this expression into perturbative series one gets series in inverse power of small at large since log is not a very strong function one would need to reach rather far in momentum scale compared to the basic scale qcd m and gev gev to make coupling rather weak to give an idea gev now we return to non perturbative phenomena substituting it into the nential function mentioned above one obtains certain powers of the momentum scale exp c qcd p c so one may reformulate our denition of the non perturbative eects as those march wspc book trim size for in in allinone brief history of non abelian gauge theories and quantum chromodynamics depending on the relevant momentum scale as its inverse powers furthermore one might expect that those powers would be some integers and indeed one expects such eects to be present they go under the term infrared renormalons and have large literature devoted to them nevertheless the origin of those eects remains rather obscure and will not be discussed instead we will focus on the topological non perturbative eects induced by logical solitons of various kind unlike small perturbative elds photon or gluon waves they by no means are small perturbations around classical vacuum the zero elds their masses or actions in the weak coupling are large count for such eects complement generalize the perturbative series to the so called trans series the main analytic method to be used are semiclassical approximation in ious settings in this lectures we will compare the results with what is obtained in numerical simulations of the gauge theories which is based on rst principles of the theory and by denition include all eects perturbative and non perturbative needless to say the ultimate judge in physics is experiment to which we will refer whenever possible brief history of non abelian gauge theories and quantum chromodynamics while most readers can skip this section some may still need some historic spective maxwellian electrodynamics is clearly the prototype eld theory on which signicant part of physics and its applications is rmly based as shown by lorentz and poincare electrodynamics require transforms from one moving frame into other by then unusual lorentz transformations einstein in extended lorentz invariance to all elds of physics including mechanics explaining that previously used galilean transformation are but an approximation at small velocities v c after creation of quantum mechanics was complete electrodynamics was also extended from classical eld theory to quantum one known now as quantum trodynamics qed development of its perturbative formulation and working out multiple applications splitting of atomic levels anomalous magnetic moments of electron and muons was quite a triumph qed is an abelian theory this follows from the fact that photons quanta of electromagnetic eld a are not themselves charged only other particles say electrons can provide a source for electromagnetic elds it is a gauge theory the wave function of charged objects allows transformation of its phase where is an arbitrary function of the space time coordinates the invariance is created by a compensation subtracting gradient of from the gauge eld the corresponding group of transformations is abelian which means that one can march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction multiply by these phase factors in any order in yang and mills qed was famously generalized to the case in which there are several types of charges to non abelian gauge theories the local gauge symmetry is not a symmetry in the usual sense because it is indeed quite ferent from say translational rotational or avor symmetries we are used to all physical observables are singlets under gauge rotations and therefore are not ally transformed thus there can not be any relations between them to be deduced from this symmetry rather it tells us which degrees of freedom of the elds are unphysical or redundant variables in order to explain its general meaning it is useful to trace an analogy with the einstein s general relativity special relativity postulates that all inertial ence frames can equally be used general relativity goes further and suggests that one can make arbitrary coordinate transformations independently at any point similarly in gauge theories global symmetries rotations in the space of internal quantum numbers the physicists came to local gauge invariance based on dent rotations in space of charges at dierent space time points gauge transformation of the charged elds now possessing some additional dex is generalized to unitary reecting the fact that in the space of charges a coordinate system can be chosen arbitrarily and it can be done independently at each space time points the sponding groups of u are non abelian since order of transformation is important in general unitary matrices do not commute with each other this leads to many consequences in particularly to non maxwellian relation between the vector eld a and the eld strength g containing the yang and mills rst interpreted the index i as isospin the su avor symmetry due to approximate similarity of the two lightest quarks u and d therefore their non abelian eld was su adjoint vector eld identied with the mesons subsequent natural application of such su group was related to the weak isospin of weak interactions with non abelian elds being vector w z bosons of weak interactions in both of these cases great original diculty was that gauge symmetry requires the vector eld quanta to be massless needless to say neither mesons nor w z bosons are massless this puzzle was eventually solved by soft spontaneous breaking of the su gauge symmetry of weak interactions in weinberg salam theory quantum chromodynamics qcd is based on the su group of rotations in space of quark s color degree of freedom this gauge group is not broken so gluons in other papers and books we use here and below the einstein s notations any repeated index is summed readers not familiar with this may need to consider more introductory texts march wspc book trim size for in in allinone brief history of non abelian gauge theories and quantum chromodynamics are massless yet they are strongly interacting and do not propagate individually due to color connement phenomenon which we will discuss in the next subsection historically qcd became standard theory of strong interaction after the retical discovery of asymptotic freedom gross and wilczek politzer running of the coupling toward zero at small distances nicely correlated in time with the experimental discovery of weakly interacting pointlike quarks inside the nucleons and other hadrons of course we will not discuss perturbative qcd as such and thus discussion and the relevant expressions can be found in appendix c derivation of the two loop beta function for supersymmetric relatives of qcd based on instantons will be given in section while the main playground of qed is in the atomic physics that of qcd is the physics of strong interactions instead of atoms one has particles collectively called hadrons some authors emphasize the fact that while atoms are nonrelativistic hadrons show large variety of regimes including very light and very heavy quarks we would emphasize even more important distinction between them in qed the vacuum is empty in qcd it is very nontrivial it is the understanding of the vacuum structure which is necessary in order to understand structure of various hadrons we will not go into large eld of hadronic models here and just present brief overview of few main directions quark models too many to mention here are aimed at tion of static properties e masses radii magnetic moments normally all calculations are done in hadron s rest frame using certain model hamiltonians typically chiral symmetry breaking is included via eective constituent quark masses the coulomb like and connement forces are included via some potentials in some models also a residual interaction is also included via some quark terms of the nambu jona lasinio type numerical calculation of euclidean time and three point correlation functions is another general approach with a source and sink operators creating a state with needed quantum numbers and the third one in between representing the observable originally started from small distance ope and the qcd sum rule in shuryak method it moved to intermediate distances see review e and is now mostly used at large time separations compared to inverse mass gaps in the problem by the lattice gauge theory lgt simulations this condition ensure relaxation of the correlators to the lowest mass hadron in a given channel we will discuss euclidean correlation functions and lattice gauge theories in the corresponding chapters below light front quantization using also certain model hamiltonians aimed at the set of quantities available from experiment deep inelastic scattering dis as march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction well as many other hard processes use factorization theorems of perturbative qcd and nonperturbative parton distribution functions pdfs hard exclusive cesses such as e formfactors are described in terms of nonperturbative hadron on light front wave functions lcwfs for reviews see brodsky and lepage chernyak and zhitnitsky we will discuss it in chapter relatively new approach is holographic qcd describing hadrons as tum elds propagating in the bulk space with extra dimensions it originally supposed to be a dual description to some strong coupling regime of qcd and therefore was mostly used for description of quark gluon plasma qgp phase at high temperatures nevertheless its versions including connement via dilaton background with certain walls erlich et al and quark related elds cially in the so called veneziano limit in which both the number of avors and colors nf ixed jarvinen and kiritsis do reproduce are large nf nc hadronic spectroscopy with nice regge trajectories the holographic models also led to interesting revival of baryons as solitons type models generalizing skyrmions and including also vector meson clouds brodsky and de teramond brodsky and de teramond proposed to relate the wave functions in extra dimension to those on the light cone identifying z with certain combination of the light cone variables needless to say all of these are models constructed bottom up but with well dened lagrangians and some economic set of parameters from which a lot of mutually consistent predictions can be worked out while i and iv remain basically in realm of model building ii remains the most fundamental and consistent approach lattice studies starting from the rst principles of qcd had convincingly demonstrated that they correctly include all nonperturbative phenomena they do display chiral symmetry breaking and nement and reproduce accurately hadronic masses yet its contact with pdfs and light front wave functions remains dicult the light front direction on the other hand for decades relied on perturbative qcd in denial of most of nonperturbative physics introduction to color connement this phenomenon more precisely called color electric connement is perhaps the most complicated non perturbative phenomenon in this section we introduce eral ways in which its presence or absence called deconf inement at high ature densities can be dened and studied in a qualitative form its denition can be that no object with color electric charge such as quarks or gluons or any combination of them with nonzero charge appears in physical spectrum however to prove it in theory or in practice is rather hard so many other denitions are used in pure gauge su nc theories deconnement transition is related with breaking march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction to color connement of certain well dened symmetry called center symmetry therefore the transition is a phase transition with a well dened order parameter so we will start with the corresponding explanations and lattice data in subsection another manifestation of connement is formation of ux tubes between quarks and related linear conning potential v r r in wilson this idea was reformulated for lattice studies requiring that the so called wilson loop have pectation value decreasing as an exponent of its area if the area is large w large c exp t discussion of this statement will be done in subsection another interesting denition of connement is related with bose einstein densation bec of magnetic monopoles the introduction of this idea is given below with much more detailed discussion of it in chapter devoted to magnetic monopoles let me here only mention that bec can be detected in a number of ways with certain specially constructed order parameters however those eters are nonlocal ones and it is not clear where they do or do not show up as a singularity of the free energy connement can be associated with existence of the electric ux tubes with a nonzero tension we will discuss those in chapter devoted to qcd ux tubes this operational denition is not in fact correct it has been theoretically argued and recently observed on the lattice that the electric ux tubes can in fact exist even in the deconned phase finally the so called hagedorn phenomenon a divergence of the partition funciton of hadronic matter can also serve as an approximate indicator of the deconnement transition polyakov lines the polyakov line polyakov is dened as a similar integral as in w but over the euclidean time dened on a closed circle c around matsubara euclidean time see fig with circumference p p p t r p nc the hats here and below remind us that it is still a matrix in color space since a is hermitian p is unitary matrix u nc p exp means path order exponent dened as a limit of a product of matricies describing small steps in time on the lattice p can be seen as a product of link variables and the product should be done over the same circular contour c the corresponding integrals in mathematics are known as holonomies unlike gauge potential itself p is gauge invariant due to close contour c the example of the simplest non abelian group su will often be discussed march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction fig the polyakov line p on the lattice the vertical direction is that of euclidean time periodicity in it means that the elds on upper and the lower planes are identied assuming p is diagonal it has the form e i where the phase is where is from the fact that color generator is and we introduced a new parameter for the average eld strength then the trace is the physical meaning of vacuum expectation value vev of p is the eective quark free energy t p p exp fq t in the conning phase of pure gauge theories p which corresponds to innitely heavy point quark while deconnement means that it is nite p so for su case the so called trivial holonomy corresponds to values p while the conning value are p qcd is of course based on su gauge theory and thus p a are matrices we will discuss those when needed let us give an example of the numerical ulations of lattice qcd shown in fig in qcd transition is smooth crossover while in pure gauge su theory without quarks not shown the vev of p at t tc is strictly zero with a jump at tc small means large eective quark free energy and strong suppression of their contribution to physical processes at low temperatures p p march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction to color connement fig lattice data on the average value of the renormalized polyakov line as a function of the temperature t in qcd dierent points correspond to dierent lattice actions two vertical lines indicate location of the critical point following from studies of the thermodynamical observables wilson lines and vortices using the language of color charges in particular very heavy external quarks one explains absence of colored states by the existence of color electric ux tubes as shown in fig it has a non zero tension energy per length and thus creates a linear potential between charges in qcd with light quarks those string can be broken if its length is sucient for production of two heavy light mesons ken wilson in s played key role in formulation of the non perturbative denition of qcd like theories on the lattice he also promoted the statement about a linear potential to a more abstract mathematical form the vev of the wilson line over some contour c of suciently large size with the matrix valued color gauge eld p exp means product of exponents along a given contour c its vev should behave as follows w t rp w e area the area means to be of a surface inclosed by the contour c if it is a rectangular l and contour t l in plane it is indeed corresponds to the area t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction fig a sketch of a heavy heavy evolution from small distances bottom to broken ux tube and formation of two heavy light meson excitations top is identied with the string tension this statement is known as the so called wilson s connement criterium the main achievement of the very rst numerical lattice studies by m creutz in were demonstration of the area law both in the strong and weak coupling settings what kind of gauge eld congurations may lead to such area law this question lead to attention to the congurations with a nontrivial topology known as vortices quantized vortices in liquid helium and superconductors are well known c over any contour keep and they are characterized by the fact that integral the same value su n is dened as the set of elements with commute with the center zn each group member those are n n note that in the simplest non abelian group with n there are with squares equal to two elements in the gauge theory people looked at the so called center vortices for which the circulation integral around them is zn let us in particular focus on element in the n case each time such vortex pierces the wilson line there is a sign change note that in dimension linkage of the d wilson line with the d vortex line history is a topological concept note also that since one thinks about w in plane the d vortex should be extended in the dual plane now if there is a certain ensemble of center vortices the area law follows suppose their locations is random and n of them are linked with smaller wilson line with area a the probability to have n piercing it is p n c n n a a n n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction to color connement and w n n l n e the argument in this form is due to engelhardt reinhardt et al if it is suciently dense as lattice studies had shown one obtains nearly all experimental value of the string tension removing center vortices from lattice gauge eld congurations leads to zero string tension thus the so called nance of center vortices claimed more details about the center vortices as the origin of connement can be found in the connement problem in lattice gauge theory j greensite prog part nucl phys hep hadronic

polarizations of the quark elds are independent of each other and can be rotated separately one may wander how the small quark masses in qcd lagrangian can be seen in a hadronic work in fact they can via massless pions the goldstone modes of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry one may also wander if the phenomenon of the deconf inement can be really pressed in hadronic framework yes it can via the so called hagedorn phenomenon hagedorn noticed that the spectral density of hadronic masses grows very rapidly approximately exponentially em th and as a result when t approaches th the statistical sum z diverges due to eration of many states the reason why grows so fast is very nontrivial already in s hadronic phenomenology the regge trajectories and veneziano scattering amplitudes could be explained by so called qcd strings or ux tubes connecting the quarks march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction fig a sketch of a meson structure at low t left and high t right with a string excitation important observation is that strings have much more states congurations than particles illustrated in fig attempts to create eective theory of the qcd strings of course later lead to the appearance of the string theory which with time switched to much larger time dimensions and claimed a high title of theory of everything including gravity nobody has a clue if this is or is not true particle monopoles including the real time minkowskian applications how magnetic charges may coexists with quantum was explained by dirac who found that it may only happen when the electric and magnetic charges satisfy a particular relation which makes singular lines between monopoles the dirac strings invisible g thooft and polyakov discovered monopole solution in non abelian gauge theories with scalars t hooft polyakov existence of monopoles were used in famous model of connement due to nambu mandelstam t hooft who argued that if the monopole density is large enough for their bose einstein condensation the resulting dual superconductor will expel tric color eld via dual meissner eect creating electric ux tubes monopoles were identied on the lattice starting from s their properties spatial relations and paths in time analysed it was in particularly observed that these monopoles do indeed rotate around the ux tubes producing solenoidal netic current needed to stabilize the ux tubes their paths do indeed indicate their bose einstein condensation at t tc elimination of monopoles from tice congurations also kills connement thus there are also papers on monopole dominance in the connement problem note that since magnetic monopoles are the d topological objects they are particles although lattice simulations can only work with an euclidean nary time nothing prevents one to use monopoles in real time applications such was just years old then march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instantons and its constituents the instanton dyons applications included studies of the quark and gluon scatterings on monopoles signicantly contributing to small value of kinetic coecient viscosity of gluon plasma recently there were identied contribution of the monopoles to jet quenching instantons and its constituents the instanton dyons finally non abelian gauge theories also have some d solitons with nontrivial topology belavin et al known as instantons they do not explain ment in four dimensions as their elds falls too quickly to generate a wilson s area law but they induce important eects associated with light quarks intantons have fermionic zero modes solutions of the dirac eqn in such elds with the zero r s because the contribution for a gauge eld conguration to the partition function is proportional to the determinant of the dirac operator naively zero eigenvalues mean that instantons can not appear in the ensemble this is indeed true for a single instanton however if there is an ensemble of them the so called instanton liquid it is possible the phenomenon can be described as a collectivization of these fermionic zero modes into the so called zero mode zone zmz of quasi zero dirac eigenstates fig short and long loops in the fermionic determinant if the instanton density is suciently large zmz has states arbitrary close to zero which forms the so called quark condensate the zmz has been observed on the lattice and indeed shown to be made of linear superposition of zero modes of the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction of all individual instantons removing zmz which constitutes only about fermionic states leads to eective restoration of the chiral symmetry and change in hadronic masses by large amount typically percents this is also true for the nucleons which mass is also that of all of us and of the whole visible matter so it is a very important eect we will also discuss several other instanton induced eects one of them is pairing not in the qq channel producing chiral symmetry breaking but in the diquark qq channel leading to color superconductivity the celebrated witten solution of n supersymmetric gluodynamics is mostly a series of all order instanton eects derived by the explicit calculation of all instanton amplitudes by n nekrasov in decreasing the temperature below one nds a nontrivial average value of indicating that an expectation value of the gauge the polyakov line p potential is nonzero v this calls for re dening the boundary condition of at innity for all solitons including instantons that lead to discovery by kraan and van baal lee and li that nonzero v splits instantons into nc number of colors constituents the selfdual instanton since these objects have nonzero electric and magnetic charges and source abelian diagonal massless gluons the corresponding ensemble is an instanton dyon plasma with long range coulomb like forces between constituents by tradition the selfdual ones are called m with charges e m and l with charges e m the anti selfdual antidyons are called m e m and l m diakonov and collaborators emphasized that unlike the topologically tected instantons the dyons interact directly with the holonomy eld they gested that since such dyon anti dyon become denser at low temperature their back reaction may overcome perturbative holonomy potential and drive it to its conning value leading to vanishing of the mean polyakov line or connement in order to study instanton dyon plasma one needs to know the dyon antidyon interaction this was recently acheieved by larse and myself and several works has studied the instanton dyon plasma both analytically in the mean eld imation and numerically by a direct simulation it has indeed been conrmed that instanton dyons in gauge theory lead to ning phase provided their density is large enough in qcd like theories with light quarks both deconnement and chiral restoration transition happen at about the same dyon density more recent studies focused on qcd deformations by fermion phases which were found to modify both phase transitions drastically they are called instanton monopoles by unsal et al and are similar but not identical to instanton quarks discussed by zhitnitsky et al march wspc book trim size for in in allinone interrelation of various topology manifestations and the generalized phase diagrams interrelation of various topology manifestations and the eralized phase diagrams the objective of this course can be dened as derivation of eective theories based on topological objects various topological objects present in gauge eld congurations are all related for example intersection of two center vortices where they disappear are the monopoles two uxes with angle each make one with ux known as the dirac string ending on a magnetic monopole monopole paths may end at the instanton elimination of center vortices in lattice gauge congurations also eliminates monopoles and elimination of the monopoles eliminates the dyons if so which objects should we study most my answer is from the top down the instantons rst is based on the following arguments the instantons and their constituents have noticieable action large compared to therefore their eective theory based on semiclassical approximation can be self consistenly constructed furthermore this eective theory has the form of classical statistical ics with integration over certain collective coordinates positions of the dyons for monopoles their eective theory would include path integral over their path corresponding to quantum manybody theory for vortices one would need an analog of quantum string theory integrating over all of their world sheets attempts to reformulate gauge theory as such were made but basically abandoned note however that even in the absence of consistent theory one can still study eects of these objects qualitatively probing qft s in various conditions produce dierence response in its dierent versions and comparing to phenomenology real and lattice experiments one may identied the best if not unique explanations this is what we will do in this course a lot innitesimal probes with various quantum numbers excite corresponding mentary excitations in qcd those are hadrons mesons and baryons yet we will not be interested that much in hadronic spectroscopy we will focus on the study of the vacuum structure generally speaking those are revealed by a multitude of the vacuum correlation functions with varios local or nonlocal operators yet their detailed discussion will take us too far what we will discuss are vacuum expectation values vevs of various elds or eld combinations known as condensates for example we will discuss in detail how and under which conditions a nonzero vev of the scalar bilinear of the quark eld known as the quark condensate can be formed or whether it can coexist with color superconductivity in which another bilinear condensate let me at the onset specic strategy we will follow the vacuum state with its condensates and strong coupling eects is very complicated to understand it gradually it is convenient to start with high t setting in which non perturbative march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction phenomena are power suppressed monopoles and instantons appear as rare ual excitations with decreasing scale t the coupling grows and non perturbative phenomena increase their presence till nally they get dominant and completely reshape the statistical ensemble creating the world we live in therefore we will focus at deconnement and chiral transitions which quantum eld theories will we discuss many books and reviews focus on cataloging qft s their properties and nections in dierent dimensions the main focus of this book is understanding of non perturbative physical phenomena occurring in our physical world therefore we discuss two ingredients of the standard model sm i the electroweak one based on su non abelian gauge theory plus quarks leptons and higgs scalar quantum chromodynamics qcd describing strong interactions based on non abelian gauge theory with the su color group and quarks the electroweak theory is in a weak coupling regime and therefore most of its nonperturbative topological eects are hard to address experimentally we will only study electroweak sphalerons in conjunction with cosmological phase transition in sphaleron chapter since in qcd the charge is running rapidly changes as a function of the mentum scale considered from weak to rather strong regime here nonperturbative phenomena are responsible for many phenomena we will discuss in particular the topological eects appear in it in full glory being our main focus below however in order to understand these phenomena better it would be sometimes desirable to consider not just physical qcd but wider set of theories with and various settings of those with certain variable parameters and investigate how eects considered get modied the most obvious parameter is the number of colors nc of the gauge group and this is the rst parameter of the theory which we will change whenever it is useful to do so in some cases we will use the smallest value of it nc and in some case we would discuss the opposite limit of large nc much less obvious is the parameter in a cp odd gauge theories with term in the lagrangian we will also discuss in some cases the so called def ormed qcd with added gauge invariant terms containing powers of the polyakov loop this will be needed to aect the connement phenomenon furthermore one can consider the non abelian gauge theories possessing various f ermions dierent from the quarks we have in the real world qcd let us rst remind that six known quark avors are naturally divided in sm as follows the electroweak sector split them in three dublets ud tb in qcd we instead split them into three light uds and three heavy cbt ones putting the masses of three light to zero one nds the chiral symmetry su march wspc book trim size for in in allinone which quantum eld theories will we discuss su for left and right handed polarizations expansion in light quark masses is known as chiral perturbation theory putting the masses of three heavy quarks to innity mq one nds the heavy quark symmetry shuryak isgur and wise and expansion in mq is known as heavy quark eective theory of course one can add more quarks to qcd for example change the number of light quark avors to arbitrary integer nf u d s another deformation or the quark elds to be considered is related with their periodicity on the matsubara circle in euclidean time the quarks being fermions are antiperiodic on this circle if they instead assumed to be periodic quarks eectively become bosons this setting is used if one would like to preserve the more generally we will also use arbitrary periodicity phases which also can be dierent for each avor f so these quarks would have intermediate statistics as we will see the deconnement and chiral symmetry restoration phase transition are sensitive to the value of these phases revealing the topological objects which cause them all of these theories can be generically called versions of deformed qcd to be used in conjuction with our discussion of this or that phenomena when needed one should however carefully single out some of these deformations the special cases in which there are certain new symmetries absent in the real world qcd those may have specic behavior which is absent in qcd one example is two color case in which antiquarks can be related to quarks by pauli gursey symmetry much more important case are theories with several number of supersymmetries they as well as supergravity theories occupy large portion of qft literature n textbooks and lecture notes in the last three decades so let me explain to what extent it will be discussed in this book as of the time of this writing we see no evidences that supersymmetry exists in nature we will also not focus on supersymmetry in technical sense for example we will not use superspace notations and yet we will turn to some supersymmetric theories which proved to be useful toy models in many cases they provide valuable lessons or even analytically derived expressions for some quantities the analog of which in non supersymmetric theories are only available from numerical simulations if at all to be specic we will discuss the super gluodynamics in connection with the rst application in chapter on the instanton dyons in this theory the calculation of the gluino condensate resolved some long standing puzzle n it would be impossible not to mention many fascinating aspects of the twice supersymmetric yang mills theory two gluinoes one scalar also known as n this to be the case one also would need either to change the color quark representation from the fundamental to adjoint one in which case those will be called and the number of the types of those will be denoted by na or introduce fundamental scalars or squarks march wspc book trim size for in in allinone introduction seiberg witten theory especially in connection with the issues of electric magnetic duality in chapter some minimal information about it is therefore given in appendix conformal theory gluinos scalars leads to many more nating features which we will partly cover in the next chapter and appendix n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter monopoles one would be surprised if nature had made no use of it dirac magnetic monopoles in electrodynamics not discussing the origin of electricity and magnetism in antiquity let me jump to pre maxwellian xix century in which it was clearly stated that electric charge can be divided into positive and negative charges while the magnets if cut still produce only dipoles with the so called north and south poles in other words it was observed that it is not experimentally possible to separate magnetic charges and in well known subsequent developments which lead to maxwellian electrodynamics magnetism is ascribed to motion of the electric charges yet by the end of that era some notably j j thomson and h poincare were discussing possible existence of some hypothetical particles with a magnetic charge since then this idea has a very unusual history it tends to be dormant for decades then become very active and then dormant again it did so at least times to my count development of quantum mechanics brought in an issue of quantization at that stage the greatest impetus to the whole problem has been provided in dirac and subsequent works he argued that the equation can be consistent with nonzero magnetic charges if there are singular lines the dirac strings supplying the magnetic ux from outside and under special dirac quantization condition the dirac strings can be made invisible dirac stressed that this condition seems to be the only known reason explaining why all electric charges are quantized an introductory review on electromagnetic magnetic monopoles is e that by milton milton for an in depth source on monopoles in non abelian theories one may consult the book by shnir shnir multiple searches for qed magnetic monopoles has produced no convincing candidate events an argument why this can be the case follows from the dirac condition itself since the electric ne structure is very small the magnetic one section is written in qed notations in which the coulomb eld is in qcd march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles fig the magnetic monopole with the dirac string thick line carried the ingoing magnetic ux equal to the total ux carried out by coulomb like eld thin lines with arrows the circle around the dirac string is a path of an electron e moving around it should be very large separation of the charges is problematic perhaps at such strong magnetic coupling any the gauge eld conguration with a dirac string is sketched in fig above what one would like to obtain is a coulomb like magnetic eld from some vector potential conguration here is one which does so g where r are spherical coordinates note that for a half line the numerator is and thus the is singular but for a half line it is zero of higher degree and it is in fact zero more general form of the dirac potential is g g r r where now is an unit vector directed in any direction we like the question however remains whether the dirac string is or is not visible in any physical experiment the answer to it goes back to the so called aharonov bohm eect aharonov and bohm an electron making some closed loop c around c adx for some thin this the string will pick up a phase phase e notations to be used elsewhere the eld and charge normalization changes so that the ab eect has even been observed for quantized vortices in a superconductor in spite of the fact that quantization mean periodic wave function of the condensate that is possible because the cooper pairs of the condensate has electric charge so if their loop results in an invisible phase a single electron gets half of the phase n which is visible for odd n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone magnetic monopoles in electrodynamics phase can take any value and be observable even if the electron is never allowed into the region where plugging in the dirac potential one nds that the phase is in order the dirac string be invisible the phase needs to be and so one thus needs to enforce the following dirac quantization phase eg n fig j j thomson static electric and magnetic charges create a rotating eld as indicated by the rotating pointing vector there exists also another instructive way toward understanding the dirac tion in j j observed that even static non moving charges tric e and magnetic g create a rotating electromagnetic eld indeed two coulomb elds from such charges meet at a generic point at some angle see fig and thus create a nonzero pointing vector circling around the line connecting two charges thus the eld is rotating even while the charges themselves are not moving if one or all charges are allowed to move the existence of the eld angular momentum dramatically changes their trajectories since only the total angular momentum of the particles and the eld combined is conserved we will discuss that in the sections below with dierent normalization of the eld and couplings the extra factor will appea in the l s j thomson was recipient of the nobel prize in physics for measuring the charge to mass ratio of the electron eectively discovering the rst elementary particle known his other high distinction was that seven of his students including his son also became nobel prize winners march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles those changes later in the book for now it is enough to say that this observation would be the key to understanding of properties of the quark gluon plasma in quantum context the angular momentum carried by the eld must be tized as usual to an integer times the consequences of that are explained in the following exercise exercise calculate the angular momentum j and show that its quantization just mentioned lead to the dirac quantization condition of the charges the non abelian gauge elds and thooft polyakov monopole the solution found independently by t hooft and polyakov ments these ideas in the setting with non abelian gauge theory what is however required for success of the program is an ingredient which qcd like theories do not possess namely a scalar eld in the adjoint color representation here is the lagrangian of the so called georgi glashow gg model l ga a direct descendant of ginzburg landau free energy of a superconductor it diers from the electroweak sector of the standard model the weinberg salam model exactly by the fact that has adjoint color representation nonzero vev shown as v provides dierent higgsing of the gauge elds their mass is proportional to the commutator of their color generator with that of the vev in this model the su nc color group into its nc the simplest case we will only discuss is the nc gauge theory the corresponding algebra has generators t a a since we will be dealing with nc qcd also some explanation of the notations on color representations are in order diagonal subgroups in the nc qcd we will be dealing with quarks which are in f undamental or spinor representation of the su group this means that quark color indices run over a and color generators are t a where a are three pauli matrices familiar from quantum mechanics description of in the gg model the scalar is in adjoint or vector representation this means that scalar color indices run over a the color matrices are then given directly by group structure tensor which in this group is simply t let us take the nonzero vev to be along the diagonal so v then get nonzero masses while the boson number neutral two gauge bosons w photon remains this eld is called a photon this is not surprising since there is a relation between the su and rotational groups georgi glashow model was designed to avoid existence of the z boson then unknown experiments eventually had shown that it is the weinberg salam version with fundamental it is representation of the scalar which describes the weak interactions of quarks and leptons march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the non abelian gauge elds and thooft polyakov monopole since there is such a drastic dierence between those components one may like to introduce a special notations for the abelian projected elds without color indices a aa a a a a where we introduced a unit vector indicated by a hat in order to dene also the abelian eld strength the eld denition should not be just the usual abelian expression based on a because it should be supplemented by a term canceling possible derivatives of the higgs color direction the denition is f a a e a b c this last term is of course zero for constant higgs eld furthermore in fact it vanishes for all topologically trivial congurations of it will be nonzero for topologically nontrivial ones and the possibility to have a gauge in which there is no dirac string is based on this observation the magnetic current can now be dened from the denitions given above k f here and in many occasions below we will use tilde for d dual eld given by application of the index epsilon unlike the usual nether currents this magnetic current k is conserved by inition without any underlying symmetry the integral of its density is known in mathematics as the brouwer degree as any other topological quantity it gives in appropriate normalization an integer which dened topologically distinct higgs eld how it may happen is clear from an example of a in which the needles go radially the magnetic charge for it is v ra r g e now known as the standard model glashow was still quite correctly awarded the nobel prize that magnetic eld is dual to electric one and selfdual elds we will be discussing later have equal electric and magnetic elds relation between such eld conguration and this cute animal unfortunately absent in america has appeared for the rst time to my knowledge in the polyakov s paper march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles fig classical solutions and for the t hooft polyakov monopole at the bps limit and let us now look for a solution consistent with that asymptotical trend in terms of two spherically symmetric functions a ra aa n ra aa when those are plugged back into the expression for the hamiltonian one nds the following expression for the monopole mass e e d k h h k here we rescaled the radial coordinate evr and the derivative over is denoted by a dot this expression can be minimized by variational methods the equations obtained can be viewed as corresponding to some classical motion in the k h plane of a particle with being the time the standard way to get equations of motion is as described in classical mechanics courses the boundary conditions at small r correspond to h as then the higgs eld is smooth in spite of the hedgehog direction at large distances h and higgs becomes of the magnitude v while k and k march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the non abelian gauge elds and thooft polyakov monopole at large distance only abelan part of the eld survives as it is massless the obtained soliton happen to be a dirac monopole with the magnetic charge note that it is indeed consistent with the dirac quantization condition in fact we prefer to write it later in a more symmetric form using electric and magnetic ne structure constants namely which are then inverse to each other the solution for the eom can generally be obtained numerically two of them are shown in fig taken from shnir on general grounds the monopole mass can be written as e em m e with smooth function depending on the ration of two dimensionless couplings of the gg model some of its values are f and the special case in which scalar has no potential at all is the so called bogomolny prasad zommerfeld bps limit in this limit both prole functions are simplied and known analytically k h exercise using this denition of the bps functions calculate the abelian magnetic eld for the bps monopole observe the dierence in r dependence between the color diagonal and non diagonal components classical monopole solution has symmetries three of them is a shift in the monopole position and one is a gauge rotation u which leaves scalar vev unchanged when quantum corrections are added to classical elds a acl a one nds that quadratic lagrangian part has zero modes corresponding to directions in hilbert space of all possible deformations a in which the action remains unchanged those zero modes generated by symmetries create signicant problems in semiclassical theory they should be taken out before calculation of quantum corrections we will study that using the example of instantons later solutions with the integer monopole number m obviously have m zero modes the corresponding collective coordinate keep the same simple meanings when one speaks about well separated monopoles but the situation changes when this point one invariably asks if there is no potential and thus no minimum of it how one can select the scalar vev v the answer is all values of v is in this case possible this means in the bps limit all nonequivalent vacua with dierent v values may occur there is no way to say which one is better than the other march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles they overlap the shapes of the solutions with m and the metric of the collective coordinates turned out to be a very nontrivial problem involving power mathematics for example the m solution deforms from two monopoles into a doughnut and for larger m there appear even more exotic shapes the dimensional moduli space of relative collective coordinates called known as atiyah hitchin manifold has explicitly written metrics and very nontrivial ometry manton has further introduced a notion of slow motion in moduli space along its geodesics in nice analogy to motion in general relativity however we will not have time to discuss those beautiful results for a pedagogical introduction of them the interested reader can consult shnir some key elements of it we will discuss later in connection to selfdual gauge elds in connection to instantons two monopole congurations bound by fermions will be discussed in chapter in connection to the so called unusual connement issue polyakov s connement in three dimensions this section belongs to this chapter only partly since in it the monopole solution is not used as a particle having paths in but as an instanton or pseudo particle as polyakov calls it of the dimensional setting still it is a very famous tion from classic polyakov s paper polyakov touching on the connement problem we will discuss a lot later the part of this paper we discuss here is a chapter on georgi glashow gg model which after higgsing is renamed as compact qed the monopole is the solution to ym equations of motion we discussed in the monopole chapter now we however will not discuss particle monopoles in space time as before but consider this solution to be the instanton in euclidean d space recall that generic gg model has two couplings the gauge one e and the higgs selfcoupling called the classical action for a set of monopoles is s mw a a qaqb xa where mw is the mass of the non diagonal gluons called w by analogy to weak teraction bosons and is the monopole mass recall that for generic couplings it can only be calculated numerically the main term is the magnetic coulomb interaction term so the manybody problem one needs to solve is that of the coulomb gas with the partition function in fact this paper starts with instantons in the double well quantum mechanical problem which we discussed at the beginning of the book and ends with acknowledgement to gribov who suggested tunneling interpretation of them needless to say as it appeared i read and re read it dozens of times since then march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electric magnetic duality of the type where fugacity is large in weak coupling exp scalar eld coupled to charges z n n qa qb mw is exponentially small when the monopole action polyakov uses standard mean eld or debye approximation introducing a de n n the physical meaning of is of course a gauge potential coupled to the charges note however that since the charges are magnetic ones the gauge potential is dual to a its gradients are not the electric but magnetic eld note that taking gaussian integral in will return us to the original coulomb gas instead we will keep as is sum over two types of charges ei z and exponentiate the series in monopoles de expanding the cosine one nds that the exponentially small coecient in front of it is basically the mass squared of the eld now the magnetic potential and thus eld was the last massless eld left after higgsing now it is also gapped polyakov showed that the usual criteria of connement like the area law of the wilson loop hold and so gg theory is conning let me add that the mean eld criterium is that there are many particles in the debye cloud nm it is satised in weak coupling because m is exponentially small polyakov then goes on to the d instantons only to nd that their interaction law is not coulombic in but or short range thus no debye screening and no connement by the same electric magnetic duality the term duality generally means that the same theory may have very dierent eective descriptions depending on the dynamical regime in question for example remember how disappointed he was four years later i came to see him and told that his tons beautifully solve another famous qcd problem the chiral symmetry breaking polyakov s answer was but i have not invented them for that march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles qcd a theory of colored quarks and gluons has a dual low energy description in terms of the so called chiral eective lagrangian describing interaction of the lightest particles the pions and other goldstone mesons in which they are heavy solitons with a large mass m electric magnetic duality is basically a similar question depending which ticles are the lightest one eective low energy description should use appropriate degrees of freedom above we discussed magnetic monopoles in a weak coupling regime v the previous section dened t hooft polyakov monopole as a classical solution the reader perhaps expect that we will now develop a semiclassical theory of them with small uctuations around classical solutions included in etc number of loops like we did in the previous chapter for quantum mechanical extreme paths and indeed one can do so we will in particularly return to the issue of fermions coupled to the monopoles in one loop approximation below let us however for now focus on the following question since the coupling runs as a function of scale becoming stronger as momentum scale decreases one may ask what happens with the monopoles when or even become large due to classic work seiberg and witten we know what happens with monopoles in the supersymmetric theories pure gauge or with quark squark multiplets they were able to make a quantum leap over all such steps to exact results not only those include any number of loops in perturbation theory but any number of instantons as well we will not discuss how they gured out the answer for this one has to read their original paper but simply present the results the theory in question is the simplest supersymmetric theory which needs to include a complex scalar eld in the adjoint representation like the georgi glashow model discussed above the gluodynamics or super yang mills sym theory has gluons spin two real gluinoes spin and a complex scalar spin which we will call a each of them has two degrees of freedom thus bosonic and fermionic ones n n the qcd is a theory with additional matter supermultiplets of structure f with spin and respectively we will call nf the number of dirac quarks as in qcd or majorana ones the coupling renormalization in these theories is done only via the one loop beta function with the one loop coecient of the beta function equal nf while in the two loop and higher orders all coecients of the beta function are zeroes we will only consider the simplest case with two colors nc note further that if nf this version of supersymmetric qcd has zero beta function and is therefore a scale invariant in fact conformal theory we will however not that unlike the same coecient for non sypersymmetric theories it is strictly integer the explanation for that is given in the instanton chapter where it will be explicitly derived see the section on nsvz beta function march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electric magnetic duality discuss it let us return to the basic supersymmetric gluodynamics nf nc or sym the only complex scalar of this theory may have a nonzero vev n denoted by some complex number v supersymmetry require that there is no potential and thus one has the bps limit we discussed already the set of all possible v lls a complex plane which is in general called the moduli space of all possible vacua of the theory a schematic plot of this space is given in fig fig the map of the moduli space according to seiberg witten solution one can also use another variable u independent of the particular direction of the vev the setting allows for monopoles as the scalar is in the adjoint color taion supersymmetry does not allow any self interaction potential for scalars so in georgi glashow notations the coupling so that the monopoles are matically in the bps limit for which we gave above the explicit classical solution supersymmetry also require that for any value of v the vacuum energy remains zero thus there is a whole manyfold of non equivalent vacua known as moduli space labeled by a complex number v all properties of the system are expressed as derivatives of one fundamental holomorphic function f u in particularly the eective charge and the theta angle are combined into a variable which is given by its second derivative u u we will return to the exact form of this function later in connection with its instanton based description march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles the map of the moduli space is skematically given in fig there are three distinct patches on the v plane there is a perturbative patch in which the coupling i at large values of v is weak it is dominated by electric particles gluons gluinoes and higgses with small masses which determine the beta function monopoles have large masses there and can be treated semiclassically a magnetic patch around the v point in which the coupling is innitely strong the monopole mass goes to zero as well as the magnetic charge g iii a dyonic patch around the v electric and magnetic charges both being gets massless point in which a dyon particle with e v the coupling is weak let us for deniteness follow development along the real axes from right to left at large and the eective electric theory resembles electroweak sector of the standard model the lightest particles are gauge bosons w and their superpartners with small masses induced by higgsing the intermediate region indicated by an oval on the plot both the electric and magnetic couplings are and thus comparable physics here is very complicated for example non bps bound states appear and disappear there both electric magnetic and dyonic positronium like bound state of a monopole with anti dyon with magnetic charge zero and electric charge one can mix with electric states so the classication of even the lowest excitations gets quite complicated what is however remarkable is that unlike in the case of non supersymmetric theories supersymmetry prevent any phase transitions on the oval exact solution tells us how gradual rg ow of the charge leads to a smooth transition reaching the magnetic patches on the plot one nds that the lightest degrees of freedom are now monopoles obviously here they can not be treated by sical approach anymore but one can easily formulate dual magnetic theory of them abelian supersymmetric electrodynamics the beta function is that region is indeed in agreement with such weakly coupled magnetic theory and it has the opposite sign as indeed required by the dirac condition we will now terminate our discussion of the supersymmetric and return to the real world where so far supersymmetry is absent the topic will be qualitative map of the phase diagram of the qcd like theories with nite temperature and chemical potential following the so called magnetic scenario liao and shuryak aiming at the description of quark gluon plasma qgp near the phase boundary the arguments of this paper are based on two very generic pillars i the direction of the ow and the dirac quantization condition their combination require the magnetic coupling denoted by g in this chapter to run in the direction opposite to e thus becoming weak in the ir in fig from that paper one nds the schematic phase diagram on a will return to it few times later in this chapter we will discussion how fermions are bound to monopoles march

magnetically dominated region e which includes the e conned hadronic phase as well as postconned part of the qgp domain light region includes electrically dominated part of qgp and also color superconductivity cs region which has electrically charged diquark condensates and therefore obviously m conned the dashed line called the e g line is the line of electric magnetic equilibrium the solid lines indicate true phase transitions while the dash dotted line is a deconnement cross over line pactied plane of temperature and baryonic chemical potential t it resembles upper right part of the plot fig in that along its periphery the electric coupling is weak and theory is e dominated its physics is weakly coupled qgp or wqgp for short describe by the qcd perturbation theory the near circular line marked e g line is analogous to the oval in fig here electric and magnetic quasiparticles become of comparable mass their actions are all strong and no simple eective description of it is possible we now know from heavy ion experiments that in this region qgp is a near perfect uid with small mean free path of all constituents also known as sqgp we will discuss its phenomenology a bit later the main dierence between the supersymmetric world and fig with the real one and fig is that in the latter case there are phase transitions the blue shaded region is the region of connement on the plot it is called m dominated since in this phase the color electric eld is expelled into the ux tubes march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles lattice monopoles in qcd like theories qcd like theories have gauge elds and fermions but there are no adjoint scalars therefore stricktly speaking there are no t hooft polyakov magnetic monopoles available in those theories yet both the pure gauge theory or qcd certainly do possess some quantities which are in adjoint color representation one option out is to use the th component of the adjoint vector eld instead of a scalar at non zero temperature lorentz symmetry is broken anyway and as already mentioned in the tion it does have a nonzero vev polyakov loops this option leads to the so called instanton dyons which we will discuss later in a separate chapter ever this option would not work outside the euclidean theory attempts to return which would ruin a would be to minkowski time would also transform monopole solution another option is to perform lattice simulations with the gauge eld and then look for magnetic monopoles in the congurations of the ensemble a motivation for that e following from the example of the supersymmetric gauge theory is that in the infrared the eective theory should be something resembling magnetic abelian higgs model t hooft in particularly argued that trying to identify physical degrees of freedom from pure gauge ones one would inevitably locate monopole like singularities on the lattice we already know that dirac strings are not observable but their endpoints are as cubes in which suddenly magnetic ux suppose we select some composite not present in the lagrangian adjoint quantity x gauge transforming like u examples a polyakov line p or some component of the eld strength like f ij or quark bilinear ij but not aij as its gauge transform is dierent one can go to a gauge in which x is diagonal this separates non diagonal charged gluons from diagonal neutral photons we already discussed this for the polyakov line before the operator x is local and its eigenvalues depend on the point x t hooft argued that the locations at which these eigenvalues cross lead to singularities of this gauge xing procedure characteristic for the monopoles the procedure depends on our rather un restricted selection of x separating the gauge eld into diagonal photonic and non diagonal w elds with notation reminding the georgi glashow model a a w one can further dene the so called maximal abelian gauge mag in which the local one talk i depicted monopoles as some dogs on a leash while the leash the dirac string is unphysical and thus invisible the corresponding dog s collars at leach end can be detected march wspc book trim size for in in allinone lattice monopoles in qcd like theories gauge rotations are chosen in such a way as to maximize the following functional fm ag ret this gauge is widely used by lattice practitioners another widely used option is the so called polyakov gauge in which local value of the polyakov line is used to dene the abelian subgroup looking at the abelian projected part of the eld strength calculated from a without the commutator one indeed nds what is known as lattice monopoles some cubes have abelian magnetic uxes through its surface and those cubes make continuous paths in d the dimensionless density of monopoles in the su pure gauge theory at nite temperatures is shown in fig from dalessandro and delia as expected the dimensionless density is small at high density but grows rapidly toward tc however the best t to these data are not the inverse but the inverse power of the log t log t the question is whether such lattice monopoles do or do not reect properties of some real excitations of the system in fact lattice monopoles elementary cubes of size with a magnetic ux through their surface are nothing but the endpoints of the dirac strings obviously the dirac string themselves are gauge artifacts in dierent gauges they can go in dierent directions in the continuum limit physical monopoles are expected to have nite size and the question is a whether lattice singular monopoles do or do not correlate with the physical ones it was shown by laursen and schierholz that the lattice monopoles do correlate strongly with such gauge invariant quantities as squared magnetic eld and action the lattice monopoles do rotate around electric ux tubes creating the magnetic coil stabilizing them koma et al eliminating abelian projected monopoles from lattice congurations does kill connement suzuki et al while keeping only monopoles produce nearly all string tension we will not follow these arguments here but switch to another argument by liao and shuryak that lattice monopoles are real physical objects they do display correlations expected for coulombic magnetic plasmas and last but not least we will see that they do respect the famous dirac condition in fig from liao and shuryak one see two examples of the monopole monopole and monopole antimonopole correlators as a function of tance between them calculated from paths of the lattice monopoles by dalessandro note however that the polyakov line is a function of d coordinate while the maximal abelian gauge is dened locally for each link in suggests that the eective action of a monopole is not but rather in good agreement with the poisson

linearized debye theory such ts produce values of the eective magnetic coupling m in fig from liao and shuryak the tted couplings are plotted versus the temperature as one can see they indeed run opposite to the asymptotic freedom becoming stronger at high t furthermore its reection the bottom of the plot is in qualitative agreement with the perturbative asymptotic freedom formula as one can also realize from these plots by t tc magnetic coupling decreases not yet small this means that the magnetic component only to become m of sqgp is also a liquid the title of liao and shuryak if it

monopole ensembles so far we discussed a single monopole solution now is the time to consider acting monopoles and statistical ensembles of them this is a complicated subject and we will approach it in steps considering classical systems made of increasing number of charges and monopoles classical plasmas made of many charges and monopoles jet quenching and charge monopole scattering quantum mechanical charge monopole scattering gluon monopole scattering kinetic properties of the dual plasmas using the obtained cross sections quantum coulomb bose gas with bose einstein condensation bec at this point few comments on the term plasma and other terminology to be used plasma by denition is a matter made of particles with a long range interactions r in three dimensions it is mostly used for electromagnetic plasmas made of ionized atoms or quark gluon plasma in which long range forces are due to gluon exchange since monopoles have coulomb type abelian tails and since they come with all signs mono and anti mono available their ensemble ts this denition as well furthermore we will mostly discuss what we will call a dual plasma which includes both charges and monopoles as we will see their mutual interaction is not coulomb like but appears due to lorentz forces while they do not change energy of the particle they change direction of motion therefore they are not important for thermodynamics of the dual plasmas but are central for understanding of their kinetics classical plasmas have one key parameter characterizing the ratio of the potential and kinetic energies if it is small the potential is a perturbation those are called weakly v t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig trajectory of a monopole in static electric coulomb eld coupled plasmas and their properties are adequately described by the linearized debye theory qgp at high temperatures is an example of this kind if is in the range between to about the matter is a strongly coupled liquid if is even larger it makes the so called ionic solids the common table salt n acl is an example of the latter type qgp near tc is a dual plasma with two gamma parameters electric and magnetic both in the range it is thus an example of strongly coupled dual plasma in a liquid phase classical charge monopole dynamics let us start with a very old century problem in classical electrodynamics an electrically charged particle with charge e is moving in the magnetic eld of a static monopole with magnetic coupling g classically one does not need the vector potential thus many subtleties are absent the interaction is simply given by the lorentz force indicates the vector product and eg where r is the unit vector along the line connecting both charges it is worth noticing that only the product of the couplings eg appears furthermore the cross product of the magnetic eld of the monopole and electric eld of the charge leads to a nonzero poynting vector which rotates around march wspc book trim size for in in allinone classical charge monopole dynamics thus the eld itself has a nonzero angular momentum the total conserved angular momentum for this problem has two parts the traditional potential scattering only has the rst part therefore in that case the motion entirely takes place in the so called reaction plane normal to in the charge monopole problem however the second term restricts the motion to the so called poincare cone its half opening angle being only at large j large impact parameter scattering the angle is small and thus the cone opens up approaching the scattering plane following ref boulware et al one can project the motion on the cone to a planar motion by introducing eg j j m e m where the rst scale factor is introduced to keep the same length for both vectors now two integrals of motion are and the problem seems to be reduced to the motion of a particle of mass m in an inverse square potential the scattering angle for this planar problem can be readily found it is the variation of as r goes from to its minimum b and back to cos eg mvb as expected for the inverse square note that at large small we have potential yet this is not the scattering angle of the original problem because one has to project the motion back to the poincare cone the true scattering angle vf by namely the angle between the initial and nal velocities is cos relating velocities on the plane and on the cone one can nd it to be vi cos cos sin cos which is much thus for distant scattering small one gets the important lesson that we learn from these formulae is larger than that the small scattering angle is given by the opening angle of the cone rather than march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles the scattering angle in the planar inverse square eective potential calculating the cross section by d one nds that at small angles it is d d mv similar to the rutherford scattering of two charges the dierence apart from dierent charges is also the additional second power of velocity originating from the lorentz force fig trajectory of monopole motion in a static electric dipole eld with charges at left on y plane and right on r z plane r as monopole motion in the eld of several charges liao my grad student at a time and myself liao and shuryak started by investigating curios few body motion suppose we take two static electric charges e and put a monopole into this eld we found that it can be trapped e and between them bouncing from one to the other on a surface which consists of two smoothly connected poincare cones with ends on two needless to say the same happens in a dual settings with two static monopoles and a charge bouncing between to say charges can play ping pong with monopole without even moving that this last setting is very similar to famous invention by one of my teachers g i budker the magnetic bottle in which the magnetic monopole is substituted by a coil with a current this march wspc book trim size for in in allinone strongly coupled qgp as a dual plasma fig a monopole moving in a set of electric charges with alternating signs left picture shows the setting and right is an example of the monopole path obtained by numerically solving classical equation of motion our next conguration shown in fig is called a grain of salt it consists of charges located at the corners of d cube with alternating plus and minus charges it was found that a monopole can get out of such cage but with diculty suering multiple collision with the charges at cube corners see a typical path in fig it happens again due to focusing mechanism due to lorentz force just strongly coupled qgp as a dual plasma discovery that qgp is a perfect liquid with extremely small viscosity had lead to signicant interest in strongly coupled systems in general it is even now referred to as strong qgp or sqgp for short in literature we will now show that magnetic duality emphasizing the ow and transition from weakly coupled electric theory in uv to mixed strongly coupled electric magnetic sectors around tc can reproduce the observed unusually high collision rate small mean free path or small viscosity the rst one now can be characterized as a mainstream but it does not belong to these lectures as it requires a lot of backgrownd knowledge which the advance undegrad beginning graduate students do not generally have the second one on the contrary is rather accessible and pedagogically fruitful and so i decided to include it here device traps an electron and is used a lot in plasma research would say the monopole behaves as a proverbial drunkard who can not go home because there are several lumpposts on the street with which he mysteriously collides all the time march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles in very general terms we are going to dicuss the behavior of quantum systems containing both electrically and magnetically charged particles before we do so we will start with classical behavior rst and start with few particles classical molecular dynamics studies of the dual plasmas have been performed by liao and shuryak what this means is that we took few hundred charges both electric and magnetic both with positive and negative charges to keep matter neutral and solve numerically eom for all of them details are in the original paper the output are calculation of the diusion constant and viscosity from the corresponding kubo formulae qualitative conclusion is that each electric charge is trapped by a cell of magnetic ones around and each magnetic charge by electric ones as described above lorentz nature of forces between them does decrease particle diusion and momentum viscosity transport by a lot jet quenching due to jet monopole scattering the story started by observation shuryak that while theories of jet quenching theory of radiative jet quenching baier et al did explained the overall nitude of jet quenching it failed to describe the ellipticity parameter dened by ep dn p by a large factor well beyond the experimental accuracy this issue remained a puzzle till relatively recently to explain it one needed the monopoles it was suggested by liao and shuryak that the puzzle can be explained if the jet quenching be strongly enhanced in the near tc matter fig qualitatively explain the idea the left plot shows the naive standard picture stemming from the assumption that the so called jet quenching parameter length q the mean squared transverse momentum kick accumulated by a jet along certain length of propagation in matter is simply proportional to matter density if so the central darker region indicated higher density of the almond shape excited tem created in non central heavy ion collisions would dominate the jet quenching however this darker region is nearly azimuthally symmetric and contribute little to but if the assumption that quenching is proportional to the density q n is wrong one may nd the way out of a puzzle for example if by the eyes of the jet quenching strength is modied e as indicated at the right pictre of fig then one nds large azimuthal dependence and consistent with experimentally observed values march wspc book trim size for in in allinone jet quenching due to jet monopole scattering fig the almond shape excited system created in non central heavy ion collisions ing on jet direction it nds dierent amount of matter left plot schematically show density distribution the right one corresponds to q distribution but why relatively dilute periphery of the reball can produce more kicks on the jet than its central denser part studies of its possible origin led to jet monopole scatterings recall fig which shows that the monopole density is large only in the vicinity of tc not in very hot plasma for detailed discussion of jet quenching see xu et al ramamurti and shuryak and we only illustrate the points by two plots from this paper fig the upper plot shows the so called jet quenching parameter q normalized to t the parameter has dimension of the density of scatterers to which it is supposed to be proportional its normalization to t means that we are looking at the eective number of degrees of freedom the blue line at the bottom of it corresponds to the perturbative qgp the eective number of degrees of freedom is constant at high t and it decreases near tc being basically proportional to the vev of the polyakov line red lines with a peak at certain temperature near tc are empirical models which include scattering on the monopoles basically those are expected to be proportional to the normalized monopole density shown in fig as shown in the lower plot of fig those models are in much better agreement with the experimental data red lines there correspond to those models with a peak while several purple lines below the data correspond to the perturbative model without the monopoles so in a way we have now some experimental conrmation that a jet monopole scattering is not only happening but even in fact dominates certain observables summary we started this section considering high t limit in which qgp is a weakly coupled plasma amenable to perturbation theory except the suppressed magnetic sector as t decreases and the coupling grows as a result of it the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig left plot jet quenching parameter q t versus the temperature t red arrow indicate the position of a peak in the dependence right plot azimuthal asymmetry parameter of jet quenching as a function of particle transverse momentum pt tc sity of magnetic and other topological objects grows as a power of t by t relevent for current experiments one can view matter as a plasma made of both electric and magnetic particles both with the coupling and complicated sical and quantum studies of such medium has been successfully done explaining reduction of the mean free path and all forms of kinetic transport quantum mechanical charge monopole scattering problem the history of quantum monopole charge scattering problem is also very interesting and not widely known although in my opinion it clearly belongs to any good qm textbook there are indications that dirac after his paper on monopoles in in discussed it with tamm and they both tried to solve it but did not succeed it took a long time till it did happened a year after non abelian monopoles were discovered by two distinguished teams et al boulware et al the problem can be set in two ways first one can think of electromagnetic monopole and charge both of size zero so that only coulomb elds exist second we will take t hooft polyakov monopole solution in full glory with a charged core and tail and scatter small perturbation of a scalar on it scattering problem results are expressed in scattering amplitudes or scattering phase shifts as a function of energy perhaps to refresh you memory of the quantum mechanics course a couple of general formulae are in order the wave function eikz r contains scattering amplitude which denes the dierential march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum mechanical charge monopole scattering problem cross section of scattering here are expressions for it in partial waves expanded in legendre polynomials general expressions for the total cross section and the transport cross section are t let us think about parameters of the problem if particle is point like the coulombic eld of a charge has only one dimensionless parameter the pling it is scale invariant and can not provide a scale so the scattering phase shift can not depend on collision energy this observation has serious implications corrections to total free energy of matter and other thermal quantities contain expressions with which are in the case considered all zero as we will see electric magnetic scattering will not aect the equation of state of quark gluon plasma but be dominant in its kinetic parameters scattering depends on the couplings the product of electric and magnetic charges yet according to dirac condition this product must be an integer eg n integer this integer is the only input of the problem we try to solve provided monopole is treated as a point charge let me just give the answer for the scattering phases indeed they depend on the total angular momentum j and the integer n from the dirac condition note that for point charges they do not depend on energy the expression is where is to be found from the r s of the eqn t usual electric coulomb scattering does not have nite phase shifts it leads to logarithmic divergent expression at large r because of long range nature of the coulomb potential however in the charge monopole problem the force is the lorentz force which is not long range so the phase shifts are calculable march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles the rst term in the r s is the total angular momentum squared the last term is subtracted angular momentum of the eld the thus has the meaning of angular momentum of the particle here comes a shocking fact while j and n in the r s are both their combination entering the scattering phase is not an integer one can easily see it by solving the quadratic equation for it it is a square root of an integer that is why a quite nontrivial angular distribution of charge monopole scattering appears recall that the usual angular basis used at large quantum numbers is in fact planar yet in classical charge monopole problem the motion l m happens on the poincare cone rather than on a plane so one has to rethink the setting and select more complicated angular functions conical in the classical limit the wave function in spherical coordinates is as usual a sum of products of certain dependent radial functions times the angular functions the former basically follow from the inverse square law potential and thus are easily solved in bessel functions they correspond to the auxiliary planar projection of the classical problem of the previous subsection the nontrivial part happens to be in the unusual angular functions before introducing those let us hint why the usual set of angular harmonics should not to be used the reason is that their classical limit for large values of the indices m corresponds to at planar motion near the z plane nevertheless we have already learned from the classical limit to expect the motion to be concentrated around the poincare cone instead l the functions that we need for example in the scalar sector must satisfy the following set of conditions mn ti mn ti m n where is the total angular momentum and is the isospin the unusual condition in the above set is the last one since the vector must be projected to the space dependent radial unit vector the functions satisfying this requirement boulware et al schwinger et al will be introduced below here it is enough to explore the large l n limit of the d functions involved the result dl nl exp where n l shows that they indeed correspond to the poincare cone now we move to second setting discussing small scalar perturbations scattered on the t hooft polyakov monopole soliton in the georgi glashow framework we introduce a total angular momentum operator which is the sum of the orbital second is due to dirac condition march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum mechanical charge monopole scattering problem angular momentum and the isotopic spin with i uctuations can be written in the form in terms of these operators the wave equation for the scalar r r r r r the term which is proportional to induces charge exchange reactions we can dene a simultaneous eigenfunction mn ti of the commuting operators and r see eq this function depends only on the angular variables specied by r a solution to the equation a partial wave can be written as the product of the angular function mn t r ti r and a radial function sn mn ti t r ti is peculiar because the operator is projected along the angular function mn r therefore the angular function must be rotated from the standard cartesian frame to a radial frame this construction can be achieved by making use of a spatially dependent unitary matrix which rotates r into we therefore have where and u e r u u u u t t e a e a r z r eqs are satised by the following function mn ti u ad r march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles where n a is an eigenvector of in the cartesian basis a a and the function r obeys d t r d m r d where in eq is now replaced by its eigenvalue n we have r d t nm d e t n m we can write the function mn ti by making use of the following expansion i n t n l l m i t m mn ti a i t where l d y m these functions are normalized in the following way d cos and since the above function is a polynomial in r y r z r the function in eq is analytic everywhere this clearly shows that there are compensating singularities in u r since the equation in its most general form admits mixing between particles of dierent charge in order to get the equation for the radial functions sn t we have to write the order uctuations of the eld around the classical solutions as a superposition of the functions describing a particle with denite charge n d sn t r r mn ti where the three functions sn charge n t r correspond to the three physical uctuations with we plug the above expansion for into eq through march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum mechanical charge monopole scattering problem this procedure we obtain the following system of equations for the radial functions t h t t s t t h t s t h s t t t s t t t where we have introduced the dimensionless variable evr at the end of this section we will discuss how to x the scale and go to physical units as it is evident from the above system a mixing occurs in the monopole core between dierent charges the term involves a mixing between charges that dier by one unit the above system of equations has been obtained in the most general case for generic angular momentum t nevertheless we have to keep in mind that there are some restrictions due to the following requirement r r r r n for this reason in the case t only the n scalar uctuation is allowed the equation for this special case and its solution will be discussed in the following for t the system of equations is dicult to solve due to the mixing between the dierent radial functions this mixing is due to the charge exchange reactions that can occur inside the monopole core if the monopole core is small we have seen in section that lattice based estimates for the monopole size give fm we can neglect the charge exchange reactions this corresponds to rm considering the above system of equations in the limit in this approximation it reduces to march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles t t t t s t s t from the above system it is clear that we can identify the radial functions with spherical bessel functions having index which is the positive root of quadratic equation the r s is total angular momentum squared minus that of the eld both are integers but representing angular momentum of the monopole is not an integer number this makes scattering rather unusual namely in the limit of small monopole the corresponding scattering phase will be core we have sn independent of the energy of the incoming particle r for t we have only one uctuation allowed namely the one having charge it obeys the following equation h in this case there is no coulomb potential of the form which is obvious since a charge neutral particle does not feel the lorentz force the scattering in this case is entirely due to the monopole core we can solve the above equation numerically thus obtaining the scattering phase as a function of the energy of the incoming particle by imposing the following boundary conditions sin cos fig shows the classical solutions and both in the bps limit and for at this point we need to x the scale in our problem and to estimate the scattering length in physical units in order to do it we have to connect the physical size of the core of the monopole rm to the dimensionless units that we used in the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quark and gluon scattering on monopoles and viscosity of qgp fig scattering phase as a function of is obtained by solving eq with the boundary conditions the continuous line corresponds to the bps limit while the dashed line corresponds to georgi glashow model we recall that we obtained rm through the width at half height of the non abelianicity which is dened as the square of the non abelian components of the gauge potential therefore it is natural to x the scale by imposing that in the georgi glashow model rm coincides with m the width at half height of the function by looking at fig we can see that in the bps limit we have m while for we have m thus in the bps limit while ev fm for quark and gluon scattering on monopoles and viscosity of qgp in qgp with a monopole one need to nd scattering amplitudes of quarks and gluons the former problem has been solved by another distinguished team kazama et al but the latter problem turned out to be especially tedious because orbital angular momentum spin and color spin of the gluon are all mixed in it has been solved by ratti and shuryak in the case of vector particles the generalized angular momentum is made up of three components the orbital angular momentum the isotopic spin and the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone spin monopole ensembles there are generally two dierent ways of composing three vectors depending on the two vectors to be added rst the monopole vector spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of and due to the following relation r r r r r r n n except in the case of n where the allowed values of the total angular momentum quantum number j are is absent there are dierent ways of building the monopole vector spherical harmonics for example they can be constructed by making use of the standard clebsch gordan technique of addition of momenta n n another possibility which we will adopt here is to build the vector harmonics with j n by applying vector operators to the scalar harmonics as we will see in the following weinberg by denition these harmonics can be introduced as eigenfunctions of the operator of the radial component of the spin r we will show that this is a very useful choice for the hedgehog conguration we are working in in fact there is a natural separation between radial and transverse vectors making this choice particularly useful for studying spherically symmetric problems the vector harmonics with the minimum allowed angular momentum j can not be constructed in this way and must be treated specially as already mentioned there is more than one way to obtain a given value of j and thus several multiplets of harmonics with the same total angular momentum in the in general following we will classify the multiplets by the eigenvalue of r but it is further restricted by the requirement which implies that n lies in the range j to j this gives n for j and and and and and for j all combinations are allowed except we denote the vector harmonics by m j n they obey the following eigenvalue march wspc book trim size for in in allinone transport coecients from binary quantum scattering equations r in the case j m j n m n all the possible combinations of n and are allowed m j n transport coecients from binary quantum scattering in the gas approximation all transport coecients are inversely proportional to the so called transport cross section normally dened as t cos where is the scattering angle while the factor in brackets vanishes at small angles the rutherford singularity in the cross section for any charged particle leads to its logarithmic divergence since we will be comparing the gluon scattering on monopoles with that on gluons let us rst introduce those benchmarks namely the well known lowest order qcd processes the gg and qq scatterings dqq dgg dt where we remind the electric coupling is related to s as usual s while for non identical particles the transport cross section is simply given by the cross section weighted by momentum transport t for identical ones such as gg one needs to introduce the additional factor in order to suppress backward scattering as well the integrated transport cross sections themselves are given by t gg log min t qq log min where the smallest scattering angle can be related to the electric screening mass by d s note that the forward scattering log in the gg case has a coecient which is roughly four times larger as a consequence of the gluon color min m march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig a charge scattering on a dimensional array of correlated monopoles open points and antimonopoles closed points the dotted circle indicates a region of impact parameters for which scattering on a single monopole is a reasonable approximation being roughly twice that of a fundamental quark note also that the gg scattering is signicantly larger at large angles as compared to the qq scattering we explained already in the introduction that the charge monopole scattering is rutherford like at small angles this comes from harmonics with large angular momenta large impact parameters however in matter there is a nite density of monopoles so the issue of the scattering should be reconsidered a sketch of the setting assuming strong correlation of monopoles into a crystal like structure is shown in fig a sphere of inuence of one dotted circle gives the maximal impact parameter to be used as a result the impact parameter is limited from above by some bmax which implies that only a nite number of partial waves should be included the range of partial waves to be included in the scattering amplitude can be estimated as follows jmax n at t is small since at asymptotically high t the monopole density nmono t jmax asymptotically grows compared to the density of quarks and gluons logarithmically with t so only in the academic limit t one gets jmax and the usual free space scattering amplitudes calculated in boulware et al with all partial waves are recovered however in reality we have to recalculate the scattering retaining only several lowest partial waves from the sum as we will see this dramatically changes the angular distribution by strongly depleting scattering at small angles and enhancing scattering backwards the integrands of the transport cross section are shown in fig jmax right panel for n jmax left panel n one can see how much their angular distribution is distorted strong oscillations of this function occur because we use a sharp cuto for the higher harmonics which represents diraction of a sharp edge this edge in reality does not exist and can be cos a march wspc book trim size for in in allinone transport coecients from binary quantum scattering integrand of the trasport cross section fig lowest partial waves included for a scalar particle with n left and curves can be easily recognized by higher jmax having more oscillations cos with only and right the fig normalized transport cross section as a function of cuto in maximal harmonics retained for n removed by any smooth edge prescription for example a gaussian weight however we further found that the transport cross section itself is rather insensitive to these oscillations and thus there is no need in smoothening the scattering amplitude the transport cross section as a function of jmax is shown in fig it is large and smoothly rising with the cuto where one can also nd the resulting angular distribution and its contribution to transport cross section the upper plot shows angular distribution of the scattering amplitude with a cuto at certain total angular momentum indicated on the plot look for a example at the blue dashed line with the largest jmax one can see a forward peak near zero angle but also a backward peak in the opposite direction march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig left panel gluon monopole and gluon gluon scattering rate right panel monopole and gluon gluon viscosity over entropy ratio s this backward scattering is dominating the transport cross section convoluting the cross sections found with the monopole density and gluon mentum distribution we plot the scattering rates nt per gluon vs t in fig it follows from this comparison of the gluon monopole curve with the gluon one that the former remains the leading eect till very high t although asymptotically it is expected to get subleading this maximal t expected at lhc does not exceed where s this value is well in the region which would ensure hydrodynamical radial and elliptic ows although deviations from ideal hydro would be larger than at rhic and measurable the approximate relation of these rates to viscosity entropy ratio is s t w we plot s in the right panel of fig the results of this calculation are compared to lattice and experimental data in fig the meaning of this ratio is basically the interparticle distance t divided by the mean free path the fact that it is about means that particle in average collides with something at distance times smaller than the distance to the next particle this seems impossible but one should recall that it is not just geometry the lorentz force enhances scattering the lower plot compares the scattering rates for gluon gluon and gluon scatterings the latter is clearly dominant in the near tc region the results do indeed indicate that gluon monopole scattering in sqgp dominates its kinetic properties and explains a small qgp viscosity observed

of the temperature t two points with error bars at the center are for lattice and experimental data from rhic higher harmonics ow the points connected by line are for monopole gluon scattering described above existence of ux tubes between two fundamental charges in qcd like gauge theories is among the most direct manifestations of the connement phenomenon connement is well described by the dual superconductor model stam t hooft relating it to known properties of superconductors via electric magnetic duality in this section we discuss both of them arguing that they are only partially correct in fact we are going to argue that ux tubes do exist even above the deconnement transition temperature and that there are much better analogies to connement than superconductors most facts and considerations needed to understand the phenomena discussed has in fact been in literature for some time the purpose of these comments are simply to remind them connecting the dots once again since these questions continue to be asked at the meetings we will also point out certain aspects of the phenomena which still need to be claried flux tubes on the lattice at zero t and near tc lattice gauge theory simulations have addressed the connement issue from their beginning and by now there are many works which studied the electric ux tubes between static charges most of those are done at zero low t the documented well the prole of the electric eld and the magnetic current coiling around it march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig the longitudinal electric eld as a function of transverse coordinate is measured for a number of temperatures for pure gauge su theory from cea et al the dual superconductor analogy leads to a comparison with landau theory also called the dual higgs model and good agreement with it has been found these results are well known for two decades see e the review bali however recent lattice studies cea et al exploring a near deconnement range of temperatures have found that a tube like prole of the electric eld persists even above the critical temperature tc to at least one of the plots from this work is reproduced in fig it corresponds to pure gauge su theory which has the rst order transition seen as a jump in the eld strength note however that at t tc the shape of the electric eld transverse prole remains about the same while the width is decreasing with t making it even more tube like rather than expected near spherical coulomb behavior note also that the length of the ux tube remains constant m for this plot such behavior clearly contradicts the dual superconductor model in conductors the ux tubes are only observed in the superconducting phase why do we observe ux tubes in the normal phase and do we really have any dictions with theory here does the tc indeed represent the monopole condensation temperature let us start by critically examining the very notion of the deconnement transition itself focusing on whether it is indeed is the transition between the super and the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles and the ux tubes normal phases the tc itself is dened from thermodynamical quantities and for pure gauge theories we will only consider in this note its denition has no ambiguities at this point it is worth reminding that in fact the electric magnetic duality relates qcd not to the bcs superconductors but rather to bose einstein densation bec of bosons the magnetic monopoles multiple lattice studies did conrmed that tc does coincide with bec of monopoles one such study i was involved in dalessandro al has calculated the probability of the so called bose or rather feynman s clusters a set of k monopoles interchanging their locations over the matsubara time period its dependence on k leads to the denition of the eective chemical potential which is shown to vanish exactly at t tc this means that monopoles do behave as any other bosons and they indeed undergo bose einstein condensation at exactly t tc earlier studies by di giacomo and collaborators in pisa group over the years see e et al were based on the idea to construct highly non local order parameter for monopole bec it calculates the temperature dependence of the expectation value of the operator eectively inserting annihilating a monopole and indeed nds a jump exactly at tc in summary it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that tc does indeed separate the super and normal phases constructing the ux tubes in the normal phase since electric magnetic duality relates qcd not to the bcs superconductors but rather to bec let us at this point emphasize a signicant dierence between them condenced bosons are also present in the system both above and even the un below tc while the bcs cooper pairs of superconductor exist at t tc only the rst construction of the ux tube in the normal phase has been made in liao and shuryak the rst point to explain is that ux tubes as such do not require supercurrents indeed ux tubes are found in various plasmas one can even see them in solar corona in a telescope what is needed for qcd electric ux tube formation is in fact the presence of the dual plasma a medium with movable magnetic charges their scattering on the electric ux tube schematically shown in fig does not change the monopole energy but changes direction of its momentum thus ating a force on the ux tube if it is strong enough able to conne the electric eld a ux tube solution can be constructed for further details see the original paper liao and shuryak let us only comment that i the uncondenced monopoles exert a larger force than those in the condensate as their momenta are larger and it has in fact been predicted there that the highest t at which such solution may exist is about march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles fig a sketch of a monopole traversing the electric ux tube fig left free red rhombs energy f r and potential blue squares energy v r at tc compared to the zero temperature potential black line right eective string tension for the free and the internal energy from kaczmarek and zantow two static potentials and the ux tube entropy so far there were no subtleties involved but let us asks now the following question provided these ux tubes at t tc carry some tension energy per length does it still imply existence of a linear potential between quarks up to t and if they do would it imply that in a sense connement remains enforced there in order to have proper perspective on what is going on let us look back at kaczmarek and lattice studies of the static quark fundamental potentials e zantow the key point is that there are two kinds of the potentials at nite temperatures the natural quantity to calculate for the observed ux tubes between static charges is the free energy it can be written as f r v r t f r emonopoleelectric ux march wspc book trim size for in in allinone lattice studies of the bose einstein condensation of monopoles at the deconnement where is the entropy associated with a pair of static quarks since it can be calculated from the free energy itself as indicated in the r s one can subtract it and plot also the potential energy v r the derivatives over r are known as the string tensions these lattice calculations have shown that in certain range of r the tension is constant the tension is approximately r independent two resulting tensions shown in fig have very dierent temperature dependence the tension tc but of the free energy shows the expected behavior f t vanishes as t the tension of the potential energy v t shows drastically dierent behavior with large maximum at tc and non zero value above it this unexpected behavior was hidden in f t studied in many previous works because in it a large energy and a large entropy cancel each other so everything would be consistent provided these novel ux tubes at t tc do f indeed carry the potential energy only but no ree energy tension v in other words we suggest that the potential energy detected via electric eld squared in cea et al must be canceled by the entropy associated with it and no actual force between charges would be present in equilibrium this conjecture can and should be checked similar comment applies also to the theoretical calculation of the potential in liao and shuryak only the mechanical stability of the tube solution was derived the entropy associated with the ux tube still remains to be calculated as a parting comment while this conjecture sounds like the well known idea of hagedron string transition it can not be exactly that indeed this idea is known to suggest that at t tc string gets to be innitely long if so the tube completely delocalizes and there would be a coulomb eld rather than what was observed by cea et al the entropy in question is perhaps related to monopoles bound to the tube rather than its multiple shapes also a hagedorn transition seems to be at odds with the tension increase and size decrease as a function of t observed finally let us for clarity mention that we only discuss in this note static tials in thermal equilibrium we do not discuss potentials in quarkonia in which quarks are not standing but moving this problem is associated with certain time scales inducing deviation from equilibrium and possible dissipation it would fore require a completely separate discussion lattice studies of the bose einstein condensation of monopoles at the deconnement transition it is convenient to split lattice studies to two kinds i those at t tc addressing the bose condensed state and at t tc exploring the onset of bec by looking at nite size clusters at t tc or even t the lattice studies focused on direct detection of the monopole condensate the idea is to do a insertion of a monopole into the vacuum march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole ensembles state this method has been developed by di giacomo and collaborators in pisa group over the years see e the most self contained articles of that series bonati et al it is based on the idea that the condensate is a particular quantum state ogous to the coherent state of a harmonic oscillator with large average number of quanta n such classical like states are superpositions of many states n with dierent number of quanta created e by exponentiation of the eld coordinate operator therefore they do not have xed number of quanta since the quantum mechanical momentum operator acts as a derivative over the coordinate p i dx acting on the wave function its exponential can be expanded and considered to be a taylor series corresponding to a shift of the wave function argument by a and thus is known as a shift operator coordinate shift by a into a eld shift its eld theory version generalizes the in a gauge theory and the gauge the shift of the gauge eld we will call t and the conjugated canonical momentum is the electric eld so the appropriate operator is a shift by the monopole eld exp t i t in the non abelian theory the color index is implied the object we would like to add to the vacuum t can be of any shape for a example a magnetic monopole is normal and has a denite zero number of monopoles the if the state average of it would be zero but if the state has a monopole sate the average would be nonzero so the t is the order parameter for monopole bec the details of the denition normalization can be found in et al we only comment that it is more convenient to measure not the average but its derivative ln over the coecient in front of the lattice action the bar has no particular meaning here just it was called like this in the original work the dependence on the coupling is shown in fig from ref et al its singularity near c known independently proves that this is indeed singular at the deconnement critical coupling the particular monopole inserted is here a yang wu monopole two half spaces glued together no dirac string of the charge but similar results are obtained also for other monopoles the expected critical scaling with the known ising index for has also been demonstrated in the the order parameter same paper c march wspc book trim size

according to which in the connement phase at t tc monopoles bose condense into a magnetically charged condensate in this section we will discuss lattice evidences showing that this is indeed what happens the rst one is based on study of the so called feynman clusters as t tc from above the dual superconductor paradigm require that the behavior of monopoles should change revealing quantum motion and a preparation to form a bose einstein condensate bec the idea of identical clusters is explained in fig identical bosons may have periodic paths in which some number k of them exchange places such clusters are widely known to community doing manybody path integral simulations for bosons e liquid feynman argued that in order for statistical sum to get singular at tc a sum over k must diverge in other words one may see how the probability to observe k clusters pk grows in fig from dalessandro et al one see the corresponding tc from above data for the cluster density their dependence on k were tted by the expression k exp kef t and the resulting eective chemical potential ef t is plotted versus temperature at fig it vanishes exactly at t tc this means that monopoles

comparison to the temperature considered t k the interatomic potentials are very large so one may call liquid a strongly coupled system in literature one can nd studies of bec for other interactions for a bose gas of solid spheres but not for the coulomb forces therefore simulations for one and two component coulomb bose gases have been made by ourselves ramamurti and shuryak for the rst time using numerical simulation of the manybody path integral method used previously for such classic systems as liquid unlike the previous works it focused on temperature dependence of the density k of the clusters their t dependence for liquid calculated in this paper looks nearly the same as the lattice data on monopoles shown in fig and the procedure used to locate the bec critical temperature accurately reproduces the value of tc for liquid known both from experiments and multiple previous numerical simulations the correlations of monopoles has been studied as well and the coupling

allinone chapter fermions bound to monopoles fermionic zero modes let me start this section with a small historical introduction in when the monopole solution by t hooft and polyakov has been discovered it was not yet clear whether either georgi glashow or weinberg salam model is the correct description of the electroweak so some discussion of electroweak monopoles pened afterwards it shifted to the context of grand unication models most of which do possess such monopoles as noticed by zeldovich in their ical production versus non observation became an issue a guth in famously invented cosmological ination in order to get rid of the undesired grand cation monopoles in all of that scattering of monopoles on ordinary matter was studied for grand unication monopoles violation of the baryon number was ticed and much discussed not going into discussion of electroweak or grand unication models as such let us return to the original georgi glashow model to which we will add some fermions in fact we already discussed the supersymmetric models which have the gluinoes fermionic partners of the gluons or quarks with the fundamental color representation it is in this context that people wandered what is the spectrum of the dirac equation in the background eld of the monopole solution n the central observation is that there exist the so called zero fermionic modes there is rather extensive literature on the meaning of these states starting from jackiw and rebbi like for other topological solitons there are topological index theorems relating the number of zero modes to the monopole quantum ber m they require one zero mode for a fundamental fermion quark and nc of them for the adjoint gluino fermion as argued by jackiw and rebbi in their classic paper the operator algebra involved corresponds to a pair of creation annihilation operators with the some evidences for neutral weak current were known e atomic parity violation direct observation of the z boson only happened in march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermions bound to monopoles requiring representation in the form of two states the empty algebra and occupied ones symmetries of the problem such as cp conjugation plus a requirement that these two states dier by one unit of the fermion number let them to at the time revolutionary conclusion that the baryon number of such states are semi integer namely let us look at these two states from the viewpoint of the dirac sea picture of the fermionic vacuum state all levels with positive energy are supposed to be empty and all negative ones occupied but what to do with extra two zero energy states sitting on the monopole if occupied we still call it a particle if not a hole what about the spin of these zero mode states starting in the simplest case of the nc theory we will use the term isospin instead of the color or weak isospin of electroweak sector thus the quarks in fundamental representation we will call fermion and gluinoes in the adjoint representation will be called fermions the monopole eld is a hedgehog relating direction in coordinate space and in the isospin space therefore isospin and spin are not separately conserved yet after some observation of the dirac equation one may prove that so called grand spin is in this case conserved following standard rules of angular momentum tations one nds that k can have values in the case of quark and in the case of gluino explicit solution of the dirac tion shows that in both case zero modes correspond to the lowest values thus the number of states is k it is for the quark k state and for k gluino state conclusion a quark bound to a monopole is a single state thus it is a scalar object a gluino bound to a monopole makes states thus it makes a spinor state standard spin statistics theorem then require that in the former case one produces a boson and in the latter case a fermion further discussion naturally extends to the problem of counting the number of states and their statistics when there are several species of the fermions explicit construction of such states have obtained another motivation in with the discussion of various supersymmetric theories for review see harvey here is the main idea all fermions of the theory coupled to the monopole are expected to produce only magnetically charged multiplets which are consistent with the underlying symmetries of the theory example consider the sym which we already mentioned in relation to seiberg witten famous papers it has two adjoint real gluinoes each can be bound to a monopole leading to a fermion state n now in order to have creation and annihilation operator algebra with the leds need to be complex so like in the harmonic oscillator in which they are built from two hermitian real eigenvalued operators x one need to combine two gluinoes into one complex dirac like fermion thus there is a single march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic zero modes n set of creation and annihilation operators the maximal spin state is two partners of a scalar monopole when both are bound at the same time it is spin states spin zero can be combined with the unoccupied monopole producing scalar states we in fact do not have a state here as its wave function is not anti symmetric as fermions should as a result total magnetic supermultiplet gives the short supersymmetry with fermions and their scalar partners resentation of the n electrodynamics so the eective magnetic theory is the n sym and further study reveals among other things beautiful examples of theories with complete electric magnetic self duality it has been explicitly shown that two ories the sqcd with nf quark avors that a magnetic monopole dressed by all available fermions of these theories the long multiplet starting from states to spin states and correct number of scalars the sym has real gluinoes so there are two sets of creation and annihilation operators thus the maximal achieavable spin is one now has tor magntic particle there are states the long supermultiplet starting from states to spin states and correct number of scalars of them n n n what this means is that the eective magnetic theory and the eective electric theory happen to be in these two case the same up to the fact that one has electric and another magnetic inverse to electric coupling at one hand dirac condition require that their beta functions should have the opposite sign on the other hand they must be the same as both theories the same lagrangian the only solution possible here is the following one both those theories are conf ormal with their beta function equal to zero let us now return to the non supersymmetric world and ask what fermion binding to monopoles can imply for various qcd like theories without adjoint fermions only spin zero new states can be generated no matter how many quarks are or are not bound to the monopole so the eective magnetic theory can only be a scalar electrodynamics the number of magnetic states can be rather large both states exist for each avor so in qcd with nf quark avors the number of magnetic states we start to consider is thus half with integer and half with semi integer fermion number of course not all of these states can exist since each bound state is a boson the allowed wave functions must all be symmetric under permutations for example if all nf zero modes are occupied the states with maximal possible number of avor indices it should be symmetric tensor its baryon number is nf say for nf if all quarks have the same mass e zero there is unbroken avor symmetry and thus such magnetic states should fall into its proper avor multiplets now how would the deconnement transition be aected by adding more and more light fermions as argued by liao and shuryak it will dramatically shift downward the transition temperature or more precisely shift the transition to march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermions bound to monopoles fig dependence of the critical lattice coupling c at scale tc versus the number of mental quark avors nf in qcd like theories the thick blue line is the tting curve extended as dashed blue line beyond nf the black purple red curves on the right are lines for vanishing beta function at loop levels they indicate the boundaries of the so called conformal window at large nf stronger coupling the reason for it is simple since some number of fermions can be attached to the monopoles via zero modes the resulting states are no longer identical particles and only the identical ones most likely the monopoles without fermions will undergo the bose einstein condensation as soon as their density become critical shifting to ir direction with the lower tc or stronger coupling decreases the monopole mass and increase the overall monopole density compensating for occupied monopoles for details see the original paper let me just show one plot fig which shows that the expected trend is indeed observed by lattice studies of the theories with many quark favors nowadays up to nf blue boxes are from miura et al near coincident boxes being lattice data for the same nf with dierent number of lattice cites n which demonstrate lattice spacing consistency red diamonds are from various other lattice studies chiral symmetry breaking by monopoles in chapter on instantons we will discuss in detail how a collectivization of the d fermionic instanton zero modes resulting in breaking of the chiral symmetry by a march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral symmetry breaking by monopoles we will then show in chapter on non zero quark condensate dyons that this approach can be directly generalized to nite temperatures since some of the instanton dyons also possess the d zero modes qq above in this chapter we have argued that euclidean semiclassical theory if so one based on instanton dyons is poisson dual to the monopole approach should be able to derive chiral symmetry breaking using monopoles as well this was indeed accomplished by ramamurti and shuryak which we follow in this section one obvious diculty of the problem is the fact that a detailed understanding of the lattice monopoles is lacking they are treated as eective objects whose parameters and behavior we can observe on the lattice and parameterize but their microscopic structure has yet to be understood in particular the t hooft polyakov monopole solution includes a chiral symmetry breaking scalar eld while we know that in massless qcd like theories chiral symmetry is locally unbroken we sume that the zero modes in question are chiral themselves like they are in the instanton dyon theory and that chiral symmetry breaking can only be achieved by a spontaneous breaking of the symmetry the other diculty of the problem is the important distinction between fermionic zero modes of i monopoles and instanton dyons as follows from banks casher relation banks and casher the quark condensate is tional to density of dirac eigenstates at zero eigenvalue the monopoles also have fermionic zero modes jackiw and rebbi which are dimensional they are therefore simply a bound state of a fermion and a monopole in theories with extended supersymmetries such objects do exist fullling an important eral requirement that monopoles need to come in particular super multiplets with fermionic spin for the anti periodic or spins and for boundary conditions for fermions in matsubara time implies certain time dence of the quark elds and as we will discuss in detail below the lowest dimensional dirac eigenvalues produced by quarks bound to monopoles are the values t not at zero n n this however is only true for a single monopole in a monopole ensemble with non zero density the monopole quark bound states are collectivized and dirac eigenvalue spectrum is modied the question is whether this eect can lead to a nonzero and if so whether it happens at the temperature at which chiral symmetry breaking is observed as we will show below we nd armative answers to both these questions the phenomenological monopole model parameters are such that a non zero quark condensate is generated by monopoles at t tc recognizing fermionic binding to monopoles we now proceed to description of their dynamics in the presence of ensembles of monopoles the basis of the description is assumed to be the set of zero modes described in the previous section j element is related the dirac operator is written as a matrix in this basis so that i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermions bound to monopoles to hopping between them the matrix elements of the hopping matrix t itji itij where the tijs are dened as the matrix element between the zero modes located on monopoles i and antimonopoles j in the case we are considering this is equivalent to i tij j tij xi xi y y xj a nmra m xi where s are zero modes with origin at xi j the locations of the two monopoles m are the isospin color indices and we have used the fact that applying the dirac operator to these wavefunctions gives zero omitting further details let us explain the quantization procedure adopted in that work the evolution matrix u dened as time ordered integral of the hopping matrix in the previous section over the matsubara periodic time this trix will then be diagonalized to nd the eigenvalues for the fermion states because each eigenstate is still fermionic each is required to fulll the fermionic boundary conditions namely that the state must return to minus itself after one rotation around the matsubara circle this denes quantization of the dirac eigenvalues by i i n n where is are the eigenvalues of the hopping matrix t for monopoles that move in euclidean time we must integrate over the matsubara circle to nd the fermion frequencies one needs to diagonalize the resulting matrix on the right hand side and solve to nd the quantity one can then compute the eigenvalues of the dirac operator with u d eih i n n i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone more on fermions bound to monopoles in the susy world and perhaps beyond considering only the n i we get the case so that i butions shown in fig c and for t respectively t fig distributions of dirac eigenvalues for t and d respectively the rst and most important thing to notice is that when t tc the value distribution has a nite density at see fig which indicates the nonzero value of the chiral condensate there is no gap in the spectrum present at t tc a small dip seen around zero is a consequence of nite size of the tem well known and studied on the lattice and in topological models it should be essentially ignored in extrapolation to zero let us summarize this section as follows the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking based on monopoles is as follows a single monopole or anti monopole generates additional quark and antiquark bound states at high temperatures the monopoles have large mass and the probability of hopping is therefore low the dirac operator eigenvalues are well localized near the fermionic matsubara frequencies n using the condensed matter analogy one may say that a matter is an insulator however as t decreases toward tc the amplitudes of quark hopping from one monopole to an antimonopole and vice versa grow eventually at some critical density quarks become collectivized and are able to travel very far from their original locations the physics of the mechanism is similar to insulator metal transition in condensed matter under pressure more on fermions bound to monopoles in the susy world and perhaps beyond this is an advanced topic section on a very specic but fascinating topic namely the possible role of multi monopole states and bec condensation my interest to the subject was inspired by the second seiberg witten work qcd seiberg and witten on the supersymmetric qcd with on fundamental quarks scalars as the rst it deals with the simplest nc color n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermions bound to monopoles group su but now with nf avors of quark squark multiplets addition of massless quarks are restricted to only cases nf already has zero beta function and is thus a conformal theory as already was mentioned before the case of nf quark squark avors is normal with the asymptotic freedom seiberg and witten predicted two district singularities on the moduli space which correspond to the following particles becoming massless i a quartet of states with magnetic charge nm and electric charge ne ii a singlet with nm ne various susy breaking terms would transform those singularities into two equivalent vacua with two dierent connement phases the second singularity thus induces a dual superconductor in which not just a monopole but a monopole pair bose condenses one may wander what should this state with charges nm ne be whether it can be identied semiclassically in weak coupling and why does it only appear in the nf case studies of and monopole states lead me to an inuential paper by sen sen just predated seiberg witten works recall that if there are k monopoles there should be dimensional moduli space which has the form after the global shifts and phase is rated from the relative coordinates let x be the collective coordinates and theory the its fermionic counterparts required by supersymmetries for the lagrangian of the so called supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the moduli space takes the form n l g r where g is the metric on the moduli spaces the covariant derivative contains the crystoel connection and the last term contains the full riemann tensor calculated from g in a standard way of course global coordinate and phase part is at and do not have such additions which only appear for relative motion the metric is a non trivial function of the coordinates x explicitely known for the famous atiyah hitchin manifold of the two monopoles the fermionic part can in principle be rewritten in terms of creation annihilation operators and quantized in a usual way there are fermion empty states then one fermion fermion all the way to maximal number of fermions one can put in it has been pointed out by witten in the index paper of that such p fermion states for a supersymmetric sigma model on a manyfold correspond to the p dierential form the number of harmonic zero energy forms is known in mathematics as pbp betty number bp and is a topological property of the manyfold itself gives the euler characteristics thus the number of bound multi monopole states depends only on topology of the moduli spaces it turns out that in the case of the atiyah hitchin two monopole manyfold the only nonzero betty number is thus there is a single zero energy state march wspc book trim size for in in allinone more on fermions bound to monopoles in the susy world and perhaps beyond corresponding to such molecular state with nm this state was explicitly found by sen who argued that populating gluinoes associated with the trivial coordinates provides exactly states needed for completing the supermultiplet then he noticed that while the maximal p and thus number of fermions is the dimension of the manifold equal to one can always convolute with the epsilon p form and get a hodge dual solution since he knew it would be and come to a single solution it must be a selfdual case with p p or p this means that we need to nd an antisymmetric function of variables the wave function of two gluinoes the function itself is a bit technical and i would not give it here but only notice that the riemann term is crucial and at large distances between the monopoles when it goes to zero the fermionc gluino wave function exponentially go to zero as well to less going theories supersymmetric and introducing fundamental quarks squarks lead to similar but more complex supersymmetric quantum chanics on the manyfold see gauntlett gauntlett for qcd there is also a molecular state made of two monopoles bound together like the sen s state but now by at least quarks its existence has been shown in gauntlett and harvey using appropriate index theorem and properties of the hitchin manyfold but as far as i know its wave function was not obtained and thus the normalizability both at large distances and near the bolt or hole in the manifold may still be problematic n what these examples of what i call the unusual connements tell us well in weak coupling domain the monopoles are heavy and monopole molecules like the ones just discussed are of course twice heavier than one monopole the molecular state is handicapped at the start but when one moves along the v plane toward the stronger coupling the binding energy of this molecular state seem to grow so much as to make it the champion indeed it gets massless and undergo einstein condensation bef ore any of the single monopole states this binding is so large because of a bit mysterious coupling to large curvature of the monopole space let me end by asking an so far unanswered question are there other unusual connement cases in non supersymmetric theories the natural place to look for such phenomena is the theories with the maximal nf close to the conformal window because they have connement at stronger coupling with longer rg ow march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermions bound to monopoles march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral the quantum mechanics courses include semiclassical methods based on certain representation of the wave function starting with the celebrated bohr sommerfeld quantization condition applied to the oscillator and hydrogen atom and the wentzel kramers brillouin wkb approximation developed in nately subsequent study has shown that generalization of those to system with more than one degree of freedom as well as to systematic order by order account for quantum uctuations are dicult however in this book we will only use quantum mechanical examples as gogical tools while our true interest would be in applications to systems with many degrees of freedom and eventually to qft at zero and nite temperatures tunately such generalizable methods exist based on the feynman path integrals such methods are the technical basis of the physics we will focus on below for pedagogical reasons we will deviate from historical path of the development and start with a version of semiclassical theory recently developed in ruiz et al for the density matrix and only later will move to somewhat technically more involved semiclassical theory of the tunneling eects described by quantum mechanical instantons euclidean path integrals and thermal density matrix generalities by denition the feynman path integral gives the density matrix in coordinate representation see e a very pedagogical book feynman and hibbs xf ttot this object is a function of the initial and nal coordinates as well as the time needed for the transition between them here s is the classical action of the system march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral we study e for a particle of mass m in a static potential v it is s ttot m dx dt v feynman had shown that the oscillating exponent of it on the path provides the correct weight of the paths integral for reference the same object can also be written in forms closer to standard quantum mechanics courses heisenberg would write it as a matrix element of the time evolution operator the exponential of the xf ttot ei httot xf between states in which particle is localized at two locations considered schreodinger set of stationary states h can also be used as the state basis because hamiltonian is diagonal in this basis there is a single not double sum over them n n xf t n with n oscillating weights for dierent states are often hard to calculate and one may wander if it is possible to perform analytic continuation in time to its euclidean version with i absorbed into it for reasons which will soon be clear we will also dene this imaginary time on a circle with circumference in this way we will be able to describe mechanics of a particle in a heat bath with temperature t related to the circle circumference i t t such periodic time is known as the matsubara time indeed the expression will look as t en t n combining quantum mechanical probability to nd particle at point with the thermal weight taking integral over all and using normalization of the weight functions one nd the expression for thermal partition function z en t e n here assumed that motion happens in time independent potential otherwise it would be time ordered exponential march wspc book trim size for in in allinone euclidean path integrals and thermal density matrix while in this chapter we will focus on the zero temperature limit and the ground state vacuum it is benecial to view quantum mechanics as the limit t so returning to the path integral the expression we will use below would be feynman path integral but taken over all periodic paths with the same points and with euclidean or rotated time the probability to nd particle at certain point is then p ttot e se note here the exponent is not oscillating including with the minus sign and the so called euclidean action d m dx v se in which the sign of the potential is reversed and the time derivative are understood to be over there are two basic approaches to thermodynamics based of these expressions while the particular formulae for the statistical sum and other quantities obtained by them look dierent with dierent dependencies on the temperature and other parameters of the problem if the sums are exact one can prove that they in fact lead to exactly the same results in some applications this proof is related to the poisson summation formula and therefore the phenomenon is known as the poisson duality of two approaches one approach which one may call a hamiltonian one use the standard inition of the density matrix in terms of stationary states the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with denite energy h p en n n n the sum over stationary states is obviously better convergent in the case of large or low t in the limit only the lowest the ground state dominates p another approach which one may call a lagrangian one looks for the periodic paths with the minimal action the simplest of such paths is obviously those for which particles do not move at all const such path would dominate or high t if one ignores the time in the case of small matsubara circle dependence and velocity on the paths there is no kinetic term and only the potential note that it is opposite to the limit discussed above for the hamiltonian approach march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral one in the action contributes so p v t e which corresponds to thermal distribution for a particle in a potential v in general the periodic paths on the circle falls into the topological classes depending on the number of rotations or the winding number nw the path makes the time fourier transform of such paths are described by a discrete fourier series with discrete matsubara frequencies needless to say the general expression for the statistical sum including all matsubara frequencies is still exact valid for any t the harmonic oscillator the density matrix for this example has been calculated by the path integral by feynman himself feynman and hibbs and it is impossible not to mention this result the integrals one encounter using the denition of the path integrals are all gaussian and thus the results can be obtained exactly without any imations the harmonic oscillator is a particle with mass m moving in a one dimensional potential v feynman s result for the transition amplitude from the initial point to the nal poin y rotated into the euclidean time has the form y m sinh exp m sinh although it is not very transparent yet at this point let us note that the it is the classical action pression in the exponent has a simple physical meaning for the classical path connecting the points the pre exponet factor includes all quantum thermal uctuations around this classical path all sical expressions for the amplitude we will get below will have such form although only for the harmonic oscillator and a couple of other related problems like motion in magnetic eld such expressions are exact the diagonal element of the density matrix or the probability to nd a particle at the point corresponds to periodic paths as we argued above so setting y and one nds that the particle distribution of a harmonic oscillator that if we would keep conrming the classical nature of this limit the one in and in the exponent exp would cancel out march wspc book trim size for in in allinone euclidean minimal action classical paths uctons at any temperature has gaussian form p m exp the temperature dependent width is given by coth t this expression which we will meet a lot later in the book has two important limits at small t the width corresponds to the quantum mechanical ground state wave function of the oscillator in the opposite limit of high t it corresponds to the classical thermal result let me rewrite this expression with coth once again in order to elucidate its physical nature since for harmonic oscillator the total energy is just twice the potential energy which we also have an expression for the mean energy of the is related to mean oscillator at temperature t it can be put into the familiar physical form t e now one sees the meaning of the two terms in the bracket they are the energies corresponding to t zero point quantum oscillations familiar from the qm courses plus the energy of the thermal excitation familiar from the sm courses note that we automatically get correct planck or bose distribution from the transition amplitude in euclidean time euclidean minimal action classical paths uctons before we go into technical detail let us clarify the goals and the setting in which semiclassical approximation will be used imagine for pedagogical reasons a cle in a potential v without quantum thermal uctuations a classical particle would be located at its minimum xmin for now let it be the only one ing those one however nds certain nonzero probability p for a particle to be at any point in euclidean time path integral formalism this probability is given by an integral over periodic paths which start and end at since the weight the path with the smallest action should give the largest is exp tribution furthermore we know how to nd such a path it satises classical euclidean equation of motion and this is what we will do below in this section the semiclassical approximation the dominance of this path would be justied as soon as the corresponding action is large scl march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral such classical paths were called uctons in shuryak in order to nd them note rst that putting imaginary unit into time ips the sign of the kinetic energy for the equation of motion it is the same as ipping the sign of the potential so that its minimum becomes a maximum the paths should have euclidean time period for simplicity let us start with cold qm or vanishingly small t little thinking of how to arrange a classical path with a very long period leads to the following solution the particle should roll to the top of the ipped potential with exactly such energy as to sit there for very long time before it will rall back to the arbitrary point from which the path started the classical paths corresponding to relaxation toward the potential bottom take the form of a path climbing up from arbitrary point to the maximum see fig let us start with the harmonic oscillator as the unavoidable rst example for simplicity let us use units in which the particle mass m and the oscillator frequency so that our euclidean lagrangian is written as le because of this sign in euclidean time the oscillator does not oscillate eit but for harmonic oscillator the classical equations of motion eom relaxes e are of course not dicult to solve but it is always easier to get solutions using energy conservation since we are interested in solution with zero energy e they correspond to the boundary conditions are at plus again the ipped sign of the potential term in minkowski time the potential has sign minus fig sketch of the ucton path climbing toward the ipped minimum of the potential march wspc book trim size for in in allinone euclidean minimal action classical paths uctons periodicity

may shift its range to the minimal value at xmin is exponentially small at low temperature climbing to the potential top at is nearly accomplished if the period is large the solution in the zero temperature or in the opposite limit of small or high t there is no time to move far from so in this case the particle does not move at all limit simplies to the classical action of the ucton path is it tells us that the particle distribution sf lucton tanh p exp coth is gaussian at any temperature note furthermore that the width of the tion coth e can be recognized as the ground state energy plus one due to thermal excitation which we already mentioned at the beginning of the chapter so we have duced well known results for the harmonic oscillator see e feynman s statistical mechanics feynman

at iii the third example is the anharmonic potential of the kind v g g at zero temperature t e is given by the classical ucton solution with the energy xf g g which leads to the ucton action g g in the limit we obtain g o in complete agreement with the asymptotic expansion of the ground state wave function squared fig sketch of the ucton path climbing toward the ipped double well potential minimum march wspc book trim size for in in allinone euclidean minimal action classical paths uctons fig time dependence of the classical ucton solution yf for iv however for the most detailed studies we select another example the quartic one dimensional potential also known as the double well problem v with two degenerate minima tunneling between them will be subject of our sequent studies later standard steps are selecting units for such that motion in a single well are in rst approximation like in harmonic oscillator with frequency we will also shift the coordinate by so that the potential takes the form v corresponding to harmonic oscillator well at small y the second minimum is shifted to negative y the ucton path for the case is outside of a maximum see fig now takes the form yf we remind that in zero t case or innite circle and solution exponentially decreases to both innities see fig its generalization to nite t is straightforward march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral the action of this solution is luct and thus in the leading semiclassical approximation the probability to nd the particle at takes the form p exp in the weak coupling limit only the rst term remains corresponding to gaussian ground state wave function of the harmonic oscillator in the strong coupling limit the second term is dominant and the distribution then corresponds to well known cubic dependence on the coordinate these classical order results are of course the same as one gets from a standard wkb approximation quantum thermal uctuations in one loop the paths close to classical ones can be written as ycl substituting it to the action one can expand the result in powers of f which is presumed to be small since classical paths are extrema of the action the expansion always starts from the second order terms taking the path integral over uctuations around the classical path in the sian approximation leads to the following formal expression p exp lucton det oucton and more loops with the ucton operator of lucton dened as of f v in the case of the ucton classical solution the potential of the uctuations we put into the form where v luct w w x the term equal to is taken out as it correspond to harmonic oscillator the expression with the determinant is formal because it is divergent and get dened march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum thermal uctuations in one loop via its to that of the harmonic oscillator note that at x we return to the harmonic oscillator case the classical path depends on parameters of the problem and which we already put to but in w the rst two appear in one combination only x this observation will be important later there are several dierent method to calculate the determinant of the dierential operator we will use two of them subsequently method is based on straightforward diagonalization of the operator like for a nite matrix this includes tedious calculation of all its eigenvalues and modes this was also the rst method we used and for pedagogical reasons we will start with it note that for x we discuss w as well and it exponentially decreases at large this potential is repulsive and obviously it has no bound at the nontrivial part of the potential disappears and solutions have a generic large form with the so called scattering phase p thus the eigenvalues of the operator o are for the double well example simply and the determinant det o is their innite product its logarithm is the sum p p log det o n n where the sum is taken over all states satisfying zero boundary condition on the boundary of some large box the nontrivial part of the problem is not in the eigenvalues themselves but in the counting of levels standard vanishing boundary conditions at the boundary of some large box at l lead to pnl pn n n at large l and n one can replace summation to an integral resulting in the generic expression log det o n n dp dp dp classical path the instanton much more discussed in literature is dierent precisely at this point it leads to a zero and bound states which lead to extra complications march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral after using few dierent numerical methods for particular values of the eter x we discovered that there exist exact non normalized analytic solution for the eigenfunctions of the form sin p f p with the following two functions where arctan arctan n d n x x d e f p e x e x x x it is important that at the solution goes to zero according to the ucton denition all uctuations at this time must vanish at large time where all terms with decreasing exponents in disappear and the remaining constant terms dene the scattering phase p arctan arctan comments i the scattering phase is at small p it is p at large p and thus there must be a maximum at some p march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum thermal uctuations in one loop iii for x two terms in cancel out this needs to be the case since in this limit the nontrivial potential w of the operator also disappears iv at large time the amplitude f goes to a constant as it should the arctan function provides an angle dened modulo the period and thus it experiences jumps by fortunately its derivative dp dp entering the determinant is single valued and smooth the momentum dependence of the integrand of this expression for x is shown in fig analytic evaluation of the integral was not successful the results of the numerical evaluation are shown by points in fig however the guess x shown by the curve in fig happens to be accurate to numerical accuracy and thus it must be correct we will demonstrate that it is exact below fig integrand of dp versus p for x the integral vs parameter x points are numerical evaluation line is dened in the text since the calculation above includes only a half of the time line and the other half is symmetric the complete result for the log det o should be doubled substituting to we obtain a surprisingly simple exact result det o march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path

complete diagonalization historical origin of this idea goes back to brown and creamer brown and creamer see also corrigan et al for gauge theory instanton zarembo zarembo applied it for the monopole

shift two and more loops unlike the wkb like semiclassical theory the ucton based version of the sical theory we discuss allows for systematic derivation of higher order quantum corrections dened in terms of conventional feynman diagrams the vertices can march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral be calculated from higher order terms in expansion of the action in powers of tuation of the order f the other ingredient of the feynman diagram method the green function inverting the operator quadratic in should be calculated in a standard way in the ucton background for some examples discussed above we already have such green functions which has even passed a nontrivial test producing the correct determinant so using only standard tools from quantum eld theory the feynman diagrams in the ucton background one can compute the loop correction to the density matrix of any order for deniteness we will show here the results for the double well potential the only vertices we will need are the triple and quartic ones which follow from the cubic and quartic potential derivatives over x e x x e x the loop corrections in are written in the form and more loops bn n where in dimension of time space we discuss dimensonal quantum mechanics there are no ultraviolet divergences there are infrared ones which can be cancelled out by subtraction from each diagram in the ucton background its analog for trivial or vacuum path this is done by subtracting the same expression with the vacuum vertices and the vacuum propagator e the two loop correction we are interested in can be written as the sum of three diagrams see fig diagram a which is a one dimensional integral and diagrams and corresponding to two dimensional ones in this chapter we will apply similar approach to the tunneling and instanton paths in that case the quadratic operator admits zero modes and the green function needs to be dened in a subspace normal to them as shown in aleinikov and shuryak escobar ruiz et al the jacobian of the orthogonality condition generates additional diagrams not following from the action it is for this reason we postpone discussion of instantons in this text march wspc book trim size for in in allinone two and more loops explicitly we have a d x x zk kn is the polylogarithm function and here x x x x fig diagrams contributing to the two loop correction a the signs of contributions and symmetry factors are indicated march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path

plotted in fig by the thick line the thin line is asymptotics derived in appendix a since independent constant remained unknown we normalized it to our curve at large distances their comparison shows good agreement for although derived semiclassically and thus formally valid for large ucton action only our answer is also obviously correct at small where it merges with the answer for harmonic oscillator let us nally compare the results obtained with those one get from standard asymptotic analysis of the schreodinger eqn where the double well potential in shifted coordinates we use is v y note that it smoothly goes to the harmonic oscillator at phase log we move to the riccati equation introducing the y v y to which one can plug the asymptotic expansion at coecients turbiner y and obtain all the y log y y way to prove that it must be so was found by escobar ruiz et al using ized bloch equation for the wave function note however that in explicit qft calculations of multi loop diagrams one also nd cancellations of irrational contributions present in ual diagrams but absent in their sum such cancellations to our knowledge remain mysterious unexplained phenomena only seen from explicit calculations march wspc book trim size for in in allinone two and more loops y where the rst two terms in the expansion are classical coming from classical hamilton jacobi equation log

rst two growing terms in remains unchanged while log term gets integer coecient n log see turbiner y multiplying by path integral is for density matrix or wave function squared one nds as expected that the rst two terms coincide with the classic action of the ucton for the determinant one needs to expand at large and observe that the leading term agrees with the log expansion y term in the asymptotic the two loop correction found in the text expands in inverse powers of as follows where x see in order to compare the terms in the last two expressions one needs to substitute the ground

gx one can see that even for g the second term is few percent and the third few per mill of the classical term for all so the series over the uctuations corrections are indeed well convergent this is in strike contrast with the wkb in which the where is momentum has an unphysical next to classical correction singularity at the turning point fig the probability p to nd particle at location for the thick line is our result thin line is its asymptotics path integrals and the tunneling tunneling through classically impenetrable barrier is perhaps the most amazing consequence of quantum mechanics it was discovered already in when it was just few months old first came friedrich hund who in studied splitting of molecular states and came to the problem of the energy levels of a double well potential exactly the problem we will discuss in detail soon after that came a note mandelstam and leontowitsch that then new schreodinger equation allows particle to go through classically forbidden regions but by far the most famous is that by george gamow gamow who demystied alpha decay of heavy nuclei the apparent puzzle was why ford scattering experiments with alpha particles demonstrated existence of the pulsive barrier of the height of mev or more while in the decay of the same paper gurney and condon with a similar idea but without the analytic gamow factor was submitted the next day after the gamow s one my advice to the reader is obvious never delay a paper even for a day march wspc book trim size for in in allinone path integrals and the tunneling nuclei alpha particles emerged with smaller energies of only few mev the ing probability is the square of the famous gamov factor in the amplitude which is pgamov exp hv the in the numerator is the product of the electric charges of the particle and the remaining nucleus the main factor in the denominator is the velocity of the outgoing alpha particle this expression thus has the characteristic small parameter v in denominator of the exponent as many other non perturbative phenomena we will discuss it explains why it takes up to billion years to decay in spite of the fact that would be alpha clusters beat against the wall about times per the rst semiclassical wkb approximation which we all learned in quantum mechanical courses was developed in it was sucient to explain tunneling in one dimensional or rather spherically symmetric radial case many years later in s when one might think the subject is completely worked out feynman introduced his formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals he also realized that paths integrals are easier to do in an imaginary euclidean time it dened what we no call a matsubara circle with the circumference t and proceeded to paths integral formulation of the nite temperature theory using euclidean time paths to evaluate the tunneling rate has been perhaps done in by sauter sauter for electron pair production in constant electric eld this calculation has been conrmed in s by heisenberg and euler via their eective ed lagrangian and nally in s solved exactly by schwinger sauter s path starts as a pair at the point the energy of an electron is and it must be zero at the initial point so i m the momentum m ee the momenta is euclidean at the nal points of the euclidean path can vanish p from this point it will be real or minkowskian the rest i would leave to the reader as exercise derive the euclidean tunneling path and the corresponding action for the production of a pair of massive scalar particle in a homogeneous electric eld discussion of the euclidean particle paths related to tunneling has been revived by polyakov following a discovery of the euclidean instanton solution of the gauge theory for early pedagogical review including the one loop terminant calculation by the same tedious scattering phase method seeabc s of instantons vainshtein et al two loop corrections were rst calculated in aleinikov and shuryak some technical errors in it were corrected by wohler and myself in wohler and shuryak three loop corrections have been advice to the reader anything may happen once somebody is persistent enough few or even lots of failures never prove that something is impossible march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral lated by escobar ruiz et al as in the discussion of f luctons above the main setting is the same a usage of euclidean time leads to successful description of motion in the classically bidden region under the barrier the minimal action and thus classical paths are the most probable ones since the weight is and thus we look for minima of the action the euclidean path method is much more powerful than wkb since it can be used in multi dimensional problems while our applications will be in qfts such as pure gauge theory let us note that they are successfully used in chemistry and even biology e describing the protein folding paths faccioli we will continue to use the usual toy model a double well potential with the euclidean action s d m in which the dot means the derivative over not time this potential has two minima at known as the two classical vacua the energy levels of this system can be derived at three levels of sophistication i if one rst ignores tunneling those are given by zero point oscillations in each well with the energy f in order to have better contact with the gauge theory later in the chapter we will eliminate from all expressions substituting it by the just dened the maximal hight of the barrier for example is then vmax at small value of the only dimensionless parameter of the model the high barrier limit one can further calculate a whole series of perturbative corrections which go as powers of this parameter one use feynman diagrams to calculate these corrections corresponding to ations around a lazy path finally one may take into account the tunneling phenomenon the left right degeneracy of the levels is then lifted substituted by symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions under the parity transformation their energies e e are thus separated by exponentially small gap march wspc book trim size for in in allinone path integrals and the tunneling standard textbook description of tunneling goes as follows since the energy is conserved one can read the hamiltonian h ekinetic v where ekinetic m x m in a classically allowed region ekinetic the wave function resembles a wave with real p in a classically forbidden region ekinetic the momentum should be imaginary and therefore the wave function just decreases the word tunneling hints that one can pass the mountain the barrier due to a repulsive potential not by climbing and then descending from it but by going through it as if there be a path through the tunnel the point of this section is to show that not only one can imagine a path through the mountain it is easy and useful to nd them and even identify the best ones among them the instantons if p is imaginary one may interpret it as a motion in imaginary time it as exp p we already mentioned classical equation of motion m d dv correspond to ipping the potential upside down fig sketch of the instanton path going from one ipped minimum of the potential to the other the instantons we are looking for would be classical paths between two classical vacua in a ipped potential v v see fig as usual it is easier to nd it using energy conservation note that the path we are looking goes from one minimum to another one see fig must be at the total energy e the resulting solution the instanton is thus tanh march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral the tunneling probability is given by the corresponding action p which is twice the average potential energy so scl d cl exp scl note that it reproduces the exponent in exercise derive the gamov factor using the classical under the barrier path in euclidean time the zero mode and the dilute instanton gas the next step as for the ucton is to write the general tunneling path as small quantum deviations from the classical path and expand the action in powers of quantum corrections in the quadratic order s sclassical d the dierential operator at the instanton path takes the form o m d xcl m d cl at time distant from the mid tunneling moment to be called also the position of the instanton the last term is just constant but around and this last term is strongly changing and it is negative unlike that for the ucton this observation leads to signicant modications of the one loop theory for instantons unlike in the ucton case now the equation has not only the scattering states but also two localized bound states solutions the lowest eigenvalue is zero and the next is positive but below the scattering state energy the wave function for the zero mode is and one can nd the normalization constant from the usual normalization condition d n to be const every zero should have a simple explanation and indeed this one has a simple origin it is due to time translational symmetry in the problem indeed the action can not depend on the instanton displacement in the zero mode can be note that in the case of ucton the path is pinned at certain point at so there was no time shift symmetry and no zero mode march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the zero mode and the dilute instanton gas obtained very simply by dierentiation of the instanton solution over its time s exercise check this statement by putting this function into the uctuation equation now if the operator in question has a zero eigenvalue its determinant is zero too since for gaussian integral over uctuations the sqrt of the determinant appears indeed in denominator the tunneling probability we discuss is in fact innite we encounter here the simplest case of the so called valleys in the functional space one of the integrals is actually non gaussian zero eigenvalue means that nothing prevents large amplitude of uctuations in the corresponding direction in the hilbert space the solution to this problem is however quite simple one may not take this integral at all all we have to do is to rewrite the integral over as the integral over the collective coordinate consider a modication of by the path changes by dx remember the denition at the same time we have another denition of the zero mode from which it follows dx dxcl equalizing two expressions for dx we have returning to our functional integral over the quantum uctuation we now have the following form for it e s e scl the product here is the determinant without the zero mode often called o it is nite and its calculation will be done below but before we engaged in it let us rst explain what to do with the divergent integral over the suppose the whole path integrals is taken over some nite time from to max then the contribution of tunneling described by the instanton type path grows linearly with max one may say that the nite quantity is the transition probability per unite time but it is not a satisfactory solution in the long run if max is very large it may overcome the smallness of the exponent if so the amplitude is no longer small and one has to think about ensemble of many instantons suppose one has a path with n instantons anti instantons placed at n if they are all separated suciently far from each other as one says the instanton gas is dilute the action is the sum of actions furthermore determinants become factorized and the expression for the transition amplitude in this case reads march wspc book trim size for in in allinone as semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral exp e n dn where integrals are done over ordered positions the factor which repeatedly pears here e we will call the instanton density per unit time one can relax the nesting dition on the tunneling moments by integrate over all interval but then dividing the result by the n factorial it looks then like the exponential series but since n is actually odd one gets the following nal expression for the green function exp sinh e now it may be used for any time if it is very large one has another asymptotic of the sinh the exponential one and notice that the total dependence on is now again exponential with the corrected ground state energy e note that it is precisely what one also gets for level shift from the schroedinger equation in the semiclassical approximation even if the instanton gas is dilute it is still interesting to ask what happens then they certainly do interact if two instantons are close k because the total action is actually less than numerical studies indeed show that there is strong positive correlation between the instanton positions at smaller time intervals we will return to interacting instantons later k finally let me introduce the last issue of this section related with the so called correlation functions of the coordinates those characterize properties of the ground state and in particular show the crucial role of the dilute instanton gas the simplest observable we can think of is just the particle coordinate so let us dene the correlator of the coordinates as where averaging is supposed to be done by appropriately weighted quantum paths we imagine now the length of all paths to be innite so the correlator depends only on the time dierence recalling the old fashioned quantum mechanical expressions one can use trix elements of the coordinate operator and write this functions as a sum over stationary states which can be excited by the operator of the coordinate n en march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum uctuations around the instanton path this function is not only positive but it is a monotonously decreasing one although the sum runs over all states only parity odd ones can be excited by the coordinate operator for example symmetric ground state is absent in this sum because thus if one knows the correlation function at large times one knows the lowest parity odd state as well this is analogous to what we will do in chapter for calculation of the lowest excitations in qcd mesons and baryons now let us try to understand how the correlation function looks like if we do not specically interested in large times clearly the problem has two time scales i perturbative scale pert and tunneling scale tunneling the inverse tunneling rate if one imagines the particle is sitting in the same well all the time the correlator is one can write approximately the paths as sequence of steps or kinks however the tunneling kills the correlation and eventually i i and calculate the correlation function k f n n ndndn i where e its large time limit is exp d comparing it to the expression above one gets the gap the energy splitting between intuitively appears because the vacuum and the rst excited state of instanton plus the anti instantons summarizing this discussion if the classical action is large actually much larger than the plank constant the ensemble of paths is an exponentially dilute gas of instantons and anti instantons all such paths together lead to nentiation of tunneling correction and corresponding to the negative shift of the ground state energy they also randomize the sign of the coordinate and create the gap between the vacuum and the excited states as we will see later in the chapter exactly the same thing happens in gauge theories exercise derive the expression for the correlator of coordinates in dilute instanton gas approximation quantum uctuations around the instanton path the feynman rules as usual are based on vertices calculated from the derivatives of the potential over x in various powers large than and functions inverting the quadratic form o there are two complications march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral this inversion should be made in the primed subspace excluding the zero mode jacobian related with collective coordinate leads to new type of feynman diagrams not following from the action starting with the one loop calculation one needs to calculate the primed determinant of the operator over all non zero modes fortunately since the quadratic form o in this case corresponds to exactly solvable equation one may proceed with the most direct method of its calculation the direct diagonalization one can determine the scattering phase and summing log of all eigenvalues with the appropriate level counting we would not reproduce this tedious calculation here the interested reader can nd it in vainshtein et al the second method using a loop diagram and the green function does not work in this case although it provides a very nontrivial test for the green function discussion of this can be found in appendix in escobar ruiz et al we will skip calculation of the instanton determinant and proceed directly to the green function and higher order corrections following wohler and shuryak escobar ruiz et al we will of course not give full details of these calculations here and only present the results with some comments to next order in the tunneling amplitude can be written as h e e b c where corrections a and b are those to the wave function at the minimum and to the energy due to anharmonicity of the oscillations these two corrections are unrelated to tunneling and we can get rid of them by dividing the amplitude by in which they appear in the same way we are interested in the coecient c the next order correction to the tunneling amplitude instanton density d and eventually to the level splitting exp h step one is the calculation of the propagator the green function of the ferential operator o we dened above it however has the following complication unlike in the case of the ucton path the instanton operator has a zero mode thus strickly speaking it can not be inverted yet the inversion is still uniquely dened in a hilbert subspace orthogonal to the zero mode note that delta function in the r s of the green function equation can be written as write the sum over zero modes for generality assuming there may be several of them in the problem we study now there is only one zero mode corresponding to time shift symmetry of the instanton path march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum uctuations around the instanton path which expresses completeness of the set of all eigenvalues zero and nonzero in a subspace orthogonal to zero modes one can dene a new green function satisfying a modied equation with a new r s g og although we will from now on drop the subscript the one which is to be used below its analytic form is on the green function this is y y xy y log y where y and the perturbative green function near trivial vacuum in this notations is exercise check that it is indeed orthogonal to the zero mode in respect to both y xy xy y of its variables fig two loop diagrams contributing to the instanton amplitude the signs of contributions and symmetry factors are indicated the only dierence with the ucton case is the appearance of the new diagram c there are four diagrams at the two loop order see fig the rst three diagrams are of the same form as for the ucton path subtracting the contributions of the same diagrams around the trivial path one gets rid of the eects far march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral from the tunneling event this is so to say infrared renormalization of the diagrams their contributions are a t t however unlike for the ucton path now there appear a new series of diagrams introduced in aleinikov and shuryak and not following from classical action indeed all uctuations under consideration should be orthogonal to the zero mode d inserting into the functional integral the delta function with this condition a faddeev and popov one nds the jacobian which generates tadpole graphs tional to a new vertex xcl which needs to appear only once these diagrams have no counterpart in the expansion around the trivial vacuum and thus they need no subtraction its two loop contribution is only one diagram contributing the sum of the four diagrams is c a c is in agreement the result obtained from schreodinger eqn see e review justin and jentschura three loop corrections escobar ruiz et al come from the diagrams shown in fig their numerical contributions are given in the following table as one can see unfortunately not all diagrams we were able to calculate analytically those which we could contain irrational parts related with riemann zeta function yet the nal result for three loop coecient agrees well with the answer from schreodinger equation we mentioned before in this answer is rational so all terms with special functions must somehow cancel the reason it does happen must be the existence of certain resurgent relation between perturbative and instanton series we discussed above the rst of such relation has been proposed in zinn justin and jentschura march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quantum uctuations around the instanton path fig diagrams contributing to the three loop corrections to the instanton amplitude the signs of contributions and symmetry factors are indicated march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral feynman diagram e g h instanton vacuum table contribution of diagrams in fig for the three loop corrections left and right we write where denote the sum of two dimensional three dimensional and four dimensional integrals respectively similarly the term see text transseries and resurgence in the previous sections we have shown how one can calculate corrections due to quantum thermal uctuations order by order to the density matrix uctons and the vacuum energy instantons we did not paid much attention to similar perturbative series on top of the trivial vacuum path except to use it to subtract infrared divergencies now we shift our focus and in this section discuss more general theoretical questions we start with the unavoidable issue namely the fact that the coecients of all such series are increasing with their order so that all of them are asymptotic march wspc book trim size for in in allinone transseries and resurgence strictly speaking divergent series divergent series are the invention of the devil and it is shameful to base on them any demonstration whatsoever wrote n h abel in but modern cists tend to be non abelian and they use the perturbation theory widely its divergent series notwithstanding the main idea why the perturbative series must diverge was suggested by dyson dyson in short the argument went as follows in qed one makes expansion in order by order let us think a bit what would happen if one analytically continue qed into negative domain then protons and electrons would no longer attract each other so atoms would dissolve on the other hand electrons would attract each other and congregate in large number and so would positrons and protons a bit of thought shows that the binding energy in this case can be made arbitrary large so there would be a complete collapse of the theory as it lacks any stable ground state now if the positive and negative vicinity of the point are that dierent there must be singularity at this point therefore any power expansion around it obviously can not be nice convergent we already mentioned in the introduction a distinction between perturbative and non perturbative phenomena in the toy models we studied those can be thought of as eects proportional to powers and inverse exponents of the coupling the more denite mathematical formulation of those is given by the so called transseries french mathematician j ecalle in s dened those as triple series standing on three whales including not only powers of the parameter coupling as in perturbation theory but also exponential and logarithmic functions exp ln l his argument was based on symmetries such set of functions is closed under manipulations including the so called borel transform plus analytic continuations examples studied in mathematics usually were limited to some integrals with rameters dening special functions qm path integrals are innite dimensional but simpler than those in qft s and as we will see in this case one can indeed build the transseries explicitly and demonstrate that indeed those two functions do appear furthermore there are certain relations between the coecients known as resurgence in some cases those can be derived but its very existence in the qft context remains a mystery inter relations of perturbative and non perturbative eects are very deep one reason of why they must be connected can be demonstrated using borel transform as follows consider the following example for the integral of the r s generates the factorially divergent series in the l s clear from expanding the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral s in in geometric series dte xt borel suggested doing the integral over t instead since for the pole is at t is outside the integration region the result is a good borel improved result but for the series do not have the alternated sign the borel pole is at t right on the integration line shifting the integration cone up or down results in ambiguous imaginary part t dte xt i g g e the quantity of interest say the energy of our qm system can not have imaginary part and yet its perturbative series via borel re summation seem to get it these puzzling questions are potentially resolved by a generalization of the turbative series to the transseries the idea is that the exponential terms in them are such that all ambiguous unphysical eects like unwanted imaginary parts must safely cancel out to all orders furthermore one expects that correct transseries dene a unique function of the parameters since we will study in detail tunneling in the double well potential let me use this particular example to elucidate the trasseries issue a standard reference for results obtained using schreodinger eqn is a summary by zinn justin and jentschura justin and jentschura their denition includes particle with mass m in the double well potential v q g the quantity of interest will be the vacuum energy that of the ground state the beginning of its perturbative expansion in powers of g reads epert g note that the coecients grow rapidly in fact factorially and that all signs are the same minus thus we indeed recognize an example of bad borel nonsummable series several hundreds of those terms has been generated by some recursive tion they conrm this conclusion it is important to note that the perturbation theory has no knowledge of the existence of the second well thus the two lowest levels and are degenerate that sum operation in mathematica now have an option to try borel based and other regularizations try to do this sum with regularization borel prescription added march wspc book trim size for in in allinone complexication and lefschetz thimbles the nonperturbative eects are in this case representing by splitting of those levels due to tunneling eects the rst contribution is given by non analytic exponent in g with a particular coecient epert g g exp instanton series times another series in g called the instanton series full transseries for have the form of multi instantons times new singular function the log appearing starting from the two instanton term epert g n g e g n n ln g we will calculate below several terms in the expansion so let me now give for reference their values the question of resurgence is whether there are any relations between the turbative series and those with dierent instanton number n in zinn justin and jentschura the series generating functions g g were shown to be related by some exact relation emanating from the condition that the ground state wave function should be symmetric and thus its derivative must be zero at the middle of the potential dunne and unsal dunne and unsal had found even more direct expression of the series in terms of one function we will not however discuss these developments here following the principle that only material generalizable to qft is inside the scope of these lectures the instanton series by themselves also literally make no sense negative gument of the log leads to imaginary part which is physically meaningless for the ground state energy there can not be any decays as we discuss the lowest ground state of the system properly dened transseries however make all those unphysical imaginary parts to cancel among themselves producing the correct real answer if one would be able to show that some well dened transseries appear at least for some qft this would be a dramatic shift toward strict mathematical formulation of what these qft are yet for now no such examples are known and all this remains just a theorist s dream complexication and lefschetz thimbles elementary examples explaining the phenomenon naive approach may suggest simple analytic continuation from positive to negative and the pioneering papers dyson bogomolny zenn justin al argued so but it is not really justied and does not generally lead to the correct results see e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral the following excersise two functions are dened by the following integrals dxe dxe expand them in powers of and show that one leads to borel summable and another to non summable series naively they are related by analytic continuation but this is not true expressing both integrals in terms of bessel functions derive a correct relation between them which includes an imaginary part i examples like that show that naive analytic continuations in parameters often lead to wrong answers in general these are consequences of the so called stokes phenomenon the general theory to be discussed elucidate how and why the very geometry of the integration contours can be abruptly changed bringing in or out new saddle points and thus new asymptotic representation of the function in general the idea to complexify the integration variable of some integrals and change the integration contour is very old used in particularly in saddle point method in quantum mechanics and qft s applications with path integrals it was tried also in cases with complex action real time path integrals euclidean theories with nite chemical potential or theta angle in form of the so called complex langevin quantization many people including myself experimented with it in and found that it worked for some integrals and failed for the others recent wave of using complexication are based on more solid ground related with lefschetz theory it has been introduced in qm setting by witten in witten which we now follow suppose we study a one dimensional integral dzes a where the function in exponent s is chosen to resemble actions with typically have in qft and the mass a is in general some complex parameter let us promote to a complex variable z iy and replace real axes of integration by some contour in the complex plane since this particular function has no singularities any integrals over closed contours must vanish and thus only the open contours with dierent endpoints are of interest what those contour can be at large the quartic term is dominant and the integral is well dened only provided the integration contour c ends up at some lines or zn where n see fig so should approach one of those four lines for the integral to be well dened n z march wspc book trim size for in in allinone complexication and lefschetz thimbles fig four basic contours on which integral is well dened since their sum is zero only are independent there are extrema of this action solutions to a zm z which are at the locations a a the simplest to discuss is the rst one at the origin action near it can be mated by the rst term for a it is clear that the real axis has a minimum at it while along the imaginary axis it is the maximum for complex a this direction rotates accordingly so rotating the integral to the imaginary axes makes sense the other two also have directions on which the integral has a maximum all of this is well known as saddle point method to do the integrals further improvements start with the question whether there are lines along which res are increasing or decreasing monotonously those can be followed by gradient ow equation z s z where dot stands for the derivative over some computer time the asymptotics of the lines approaches four good directions along which the integral is convergent exercise solve this equation and nd these lines originating from all three extrema in both directions for a i these lines are called lefschetz thimbles on them are the real part of the action grows monotonously from its values at the extreme points to innity the important march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral statement of the lefschetz theory is that the imaginary part of the action remains constant on these lines instead of proving it let me suggest to check it for the example at hand exercise find the thimble lines for the example at hand using this theorem important consequence of this theorem is that since any integral over some contour c can be rewritten as a superposition of integrals over the thimbles i ci i with some coecients ci basically or each of them has xed which can be taken out of the remaining integrals which are therefore all real and well convergent further consequence is that lefschetz thimbles can only cross each other if their phases match i j those can be easily found at the extremal points rapid changes of the integral the phase transitions can be caused by crossing and change of the thimble geometry and thus ci thus matching of the phases is a very useful tool if the integral has more than one dimension the geometry of thimbles gets more for complicated and yet there are successful practical applications of that e models similar to nite density qcd alexandru et al generic contributions of the thimbles have distinct complex phases and this prevent their crossing however at some values of parameters the phases can be the same often this happens when phases are multiple of with some integer n and the corresponding contributions are real those cases obviously split into two groups the even n allows for addition of such contributions but odd n lead to subtractions sometimes to outright cancellation of them a prototype model from behtash et al nicely illustrate this last point consider the integral with complex parameters k the three extrema of it and thimbles are shown in fig and the contribution of the leading and thimbles have the same modulus of the exponential factor and form the following combination i which for integer k vanishes because of cancellation between thimbles it was then shown by these authors that in qes and supersymmetric cases when no instanton contribution was present a similar cancellation between the instantons and some complex saddles take place march wspc book trim size for in in allinone complexication and lefschetz thimbles fig the blue areas show good regions in which the integrand falls suciently rapidly at innity to guarantee convergence the red dots give the locations of three saddle points and the blue contours show the lefschetz thimble paths quasi exactly solvable models and the necessity of complex saddles let me start with the denition quasi exactly solvable qes quantum mechanical problems are those which allow some group of states to be solved explicitly with their wave functions and energies exactly known they are dierent from exactly solvable models in which all states can be found references to the original works can be found in a review turbiner in which also the underlying algebraic structure of qes problems is described in detail we will not go into general discussion focusing below on just one example for general orientation let me give the simplest example of a familiar general statement all problems with supersymmetry which remains unbroken have the ground state energy exactly equal to zero that means that not only perturbative series needs to be canceled term by term which is often possible to see but also all nonperturbative eects should somehow get cancelled how exactly that happens needs to be understood we will return to qes example a bit later but we will rst address a problem which do not even belong to this class and yet it provides a very instructive puzzle its proposed resolution is from kozcaz et al behtash et al which we here follow the problem is known as tilted double well potential tdw which is the double well problem with added linear term p with some parameter of course at small p one can proceed perturbatively the tdw is related to march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral supersymmetric quantum mechanics with the action s w pw where w is known as superpotential and is time dependent grassmanian eld we will use w w w reproducing the tdw for p the action is supersymmetric and perturbatively the ground state energy vanishes however following a famous witten s argument supersymmetry is broken dynamically and the actual ground state energy is nonzero and of course positive since the hamiltonian is a square for non tilted case p we developed above a nice theory of instantons and antiinstantons in full glory and up to quantum corrections with one two and three loop diagrams the non perturbative correction to ground state energy is negative there are no classical solutions going from one maximum to the but when p other since their hight is now dierent and energy on classical paths is conserved the authors of kozcaz et al behtash et al argue that such classical y and look for solution is obtained if one complexify the coordinate solution of the holomorphic newton s equation for inverted complexied potential i v z since the solution is going to have nite action it must start from the highest point of the inverted potential we call xmax but where can it go some thinking leads to the solution at p the lowest maximum splits into a pair of two turning points and our quartic potential can be re written in a form convenient for motion with the maximal energy as v z where at the turning point the velocity is zero and so recoiling back or going into an entirely new direction is possible so the paths we need to construct should go between xmax and a numerical example of such path is shown in fig one can also nd its analytic form see behtash et al its proposed name is complexied bion or cb for short the action of this path is complex scb p log ip g s is real furthemore for p one get the sign opposite but for p integer e from what is normally expected from a semiclassical expression in the euclidean time a number of numerical evidences that this is the right solution are given march wspc book trim size for in in allinone complexication and lefschetz thimbles in kozcaz et al but those include using dunne unsal relation instead of a direct evaluation of the determinant now we turn to the second example from kozcaz et al its hamiltonian is h w w g g p with w note that one can put recovering all answers by dimensional arguments has half natural period while the later the rst term in hamiltonian last has a natural period and the coecient containing an extra parameter so at a generic value of p every second max min is dierent from the rst that is why it is called double sine gordon dsg problem the interesting thing about this particular problem is that it is an example of qes problems let us start by following its usual logics by proposing an ansatz for the wave functions w g schreodinger eqn for is g dx p u eu the operator in brackets can be represented in terms of generators of the algebra j i i i dx dx the operator in bracket for our problem can be written in terms of those ators j the representations of require j to be integer or provided j p semi integer thus the trick works only when p is integer the number of states p can be separated from the rest and using p matrix representation of the operators j j m one can get exact hamiltonian its diagonalization should produce the energies of in the paper kozcaz et al that is all done for the p states in question exercise check that all the commutators are indeed those for algebra also check that the casimir operator is just number for j p calculate the hamiltonian in the matrix form and nd march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical theory based on euclidean path integral the energy eigenvalues expand them in powers of g and see the convergent series without exp terms summarizing this discussion if p is some integer the problem at hand belongs to the qes set indeed there are exactly p levels whose energy and wave functions can be exactly calculated since the energy has no instanton like terms one needs to explain a puzzle how this may be possible since physically the tunneling between dierent minima of the potential can not possibly disappear the direct indication of that is that energies of all levels other than the chosen p do have the characteristic tunneling corrections the resolution of the puzzle proposed in kozcaz et al is based on the interference of the contributions of the two tunneling paths one is real tunneling between and minima its contribution is straightforward to calculate also clear is that it shifts the ground energy downward new element is the complex bion solution with the action having imaginary part as in the case we discussed at the beginning of this section the solution zcb pei can be obtained from the analytic continuation from the real bounce by p pg is such and taking here cb that its real part is related to the duration of the bounce and complex log the exponent of its action exp ip for odd p gets additional minus sign meaning the energy is modied upward it is this contribution which has the to cancel that of the real tunneling it is argued indirectly from asymptotic of the perturbative series that such cancellation happens for p levels but not others why it is the case is still not clear rescb scb exp let us end with a wider question two examples discussed in this section show a necessity to include some complex extrema of the path integral beyond the obvious real tunneling paths most likely the complex ones proposed so far in the papers mentioned do indeed t the bill do the right job explaining these particular puzzles yet the general question which of all possible complex classical paths or solitons for qfts one should include and which one should not remains unaswered the picard lefshetz theory provide some light on this issue so to say in principle since the original integration contour can be deformed only to some particular combination of their thimbles yet to use it outside some single or integrals is at the moment well beyond our abilities far it was shown that both real parts of the action are the same for two amplitudes to cancel each other exactly one need to be sure that the real and complex paths generate exactly the same perturbative corrections to see this is beyond current technical means march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter gauge eld topology and instantons chern simons number and topologically nontrivial gauges topological invariants is a traditional eld in mathematics and we will need those in a form discovered by chern and simons generally they exist in a dierent form in odd and even dimensional spaces and are related in a curious way we will start with topology physically relevant for a gauge theory dened in the so called d chern simons number density is dened as the th component of the following topological current k aa aa ab ac let us select and think of the gauge eld at such times being pure gauge with zero eld strength ncs ai u substituting it to ncs one nds the following expression ncs iu u ju u ku now u is a map from a d space to a the gauge group if it is su with generators and euler angles the group is basically the sphere the expression above is in fact nothing else but the topological invariant of such map known as the winding number it is the integer number of times the map covers the group interesting gauge theories in dimensions can be dened using ncs as the lagrangian such construction was introduced by witten in and is called the topological eld theory while it has applications in physics e in quantum hall eect we will not discuss it march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons exercise consider a hedgehog form for u p r r with being pauli matices p and p only with such p r the map of the point it into the previous expression and show that the result is equal to n n with integer n note that is smooth on the group substitute what we learned is that pure gauge elds can be split into some topologically distinct classes and because of the relation if before and after of certain gauge eld congurations the pure gauge unphysical elds change this class there must be some topological charge in between usually we do not think much about pure gauge elds considering them to be unphysical and basically completely irrelevant now we learned that the so called large gauge transformations which change the winding number can not be irrelevant because their change is related to the topological charge qt which is expressed in terms of gauge elds and is clearly gauge invariant and physical suppose one would like to start with a classical vacuum in a trivial gauge with and interpolate it somehow with time dependent intermediate eld ncs to the one with ncs this relation tells us that in doing so one necessarily has to go though intermediate elds with a nonzero eld strength and thus energy topologically distinct vacua must be separated by some kind of a physical barrier since there is no reason transition from to is dierent from n to we come to the conclusion that the d gauge eld congurations have a periodic potential as a function of ncs the optimal path leading from one minimum to another is known as the sphaleron path in chapter we will derive explicit set of congurations along which ncs changes from to their energy estat will be calculated as well explaining the shape and in particularly the hight of the barrier separating dierent topological sectors let me here give the answer ncs e in parametric form the corresponding plot fig shows the energy of the sphaleron path congurations between two subsequent values of simons number and here is arbitrary r m s size of the eld distribution it appears because classical yang mills is scale invariant and the energy is simply inversely proportional to the size since ncs integers takes all integer values from this potential repeats itself innitely many times this tells us that as a function of this cal coordinate ncs the gauge theory resembles an innitely long crystal therefore the states in it can be written as plain waves to eincs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton fig the potential energy e in units of versus the chern simons number ncs for the sphaleron path solution to be derived in sphaleron chapter with quasimomentum we will return to this in the next section tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton so we already know that there is innite set of pure gauge elds therefore with zero eld strength and zero energy classical vacua classied by the integer ncs we also know that there are also eld congurations with non integer ncs but those do have nonzero energy and therefore form a kind of a barrier separating classical vacua this barrier separating adjusted classical vacua e ncs turns out to be penetrable for quantum tunneling furthermore as we will see the tunneling rate can be found even without knowledge of the detailed shape of the potential this is possible because of the following key relation between the topological current and the topological charge in the integral over the r s k ga ga qt ga march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons is the so called d topological charge let us think about the consequence of this relation assuming one deals with some gauge eld which decays well at spatial innity in a spirit of gauss theorem let us consider two time surfaces and integrate this relation in volume between them qt ncs t it means that the topological charge in a volume between two time surfaces is equal to the dif erence of ncs dened at those time moments this is completely analogous to what one learns studying static ics if there is a dierence between electric eld uxes through two planes you know how much charge is enclosed in between in this section we are going to look for a tunneling path in gauge theory which connects topologically dierent classical vacua found in the famous work by belavin polyakov schwartz and tyupkin and thus known as the bpst instanton belavin et al to nd classical solution corresponding to tunneling bpst used the following dimensional spherical ansatz depending on radial trial function af y f y with and the t hooft symbol dened by a a a we also dene a by changing the sign of the last two equations further erties of a are summarized in appendix a upon substitution of the gauge elds in the gauge lagrangian one nds that the eective lagrangian has the form lef d f corresponding to the motion of a particle in a double well potential for the im and ing sphaleron we used it in real minkowski time by changing ipping the potential to its minkowski version with an innite energy at now we need much simpler euclidean solution the same as for the quantum ical instanton connecting the maxima of the ipped potential the corresponding eld is aa g ax march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton here is an arbitrary parameter characterizing the size of the instanton like in the potential we discussed in the preceding section its appearance is dictated by the scale invariance of classical yang mills equations the ansatz itself perhaps needs some explanation the t hooft symbol projects to elds the reason we selected it is related with the following identity s ga ga ga ga ga ga where g is the dual eld strength tensor the eld tensor in which the roles of electric and magnetic elds are interchanged since the rst term is a topological invariant see below and the last term is always positive it is clear that the action is minimal if the eld is in a simpler language it means that euclidean electric and magnetic elds are the the action density is given by ga ga ga s and one can see that it is indeed spherically symmetric and very very well localized the action depends on scale only via the running at large distances it is coupling x which we will discuss more in the next section note that while the gauge potential is long range a in the eld strength the gradient and the commutator terms canceling each other so physical eects are not long range it suggests that the tail of the potential is gauge artifact using invariance of the yang mills equations under coordinate inversion implies that the singularity of the potential can be shifted from innity to the origin by means of a singular gauge transformation u ix the gauge potential in singular gauge is given by aa g x condition written in euclidean notations in minkowski space extra i

allinone gauge eld topology and instantons this singularity at the origin is unphysical pure gauge like the one for regular gauge at innity while there is only one innity each instanton has its own zero and so the singular gauge is better suited to make a superposition of many instantons what about the multi instanton solutions its a long story and the solution known as adhm construction for atiah drinfeld hitchin and manin atiyah et al in principle solved it what in principle means is that if one can solve all equations the number of the parameters in the solution is equal to the number of zero modes that let me just mention that when the solution is found one also gets green functions dirac zero modes for free automatically it all started from one brilliant idea if the eld is pure gauge a the unitary gauge matrix can be eliminated from long derivatives in a standard way the unitary gauge matrix can be written as with real if one take complex instead is not unitary and the eld is therefore not a pure gauge and yet in many equations one can still get rid of this as if it would be a gauge matrix for example the quark green function is still y the theta vacua the fact that the action for the instanton is nite means that the barrier separating valleys in the topological landscape with dierent ncs is penetrable since the potential as a function of ncs is periodic the complete set of states ized by a phase is the so called theta vacua with the theta parameter quasimomentum dened by the periodicity condition n let us see how this band arises from tunneling events if instantons are suciently is dilute then the amplitude to go from one topological vacuum given by to another i j exp i h n k e s where k is the pre exponential factor in the tunneling amplitude and n numbers of instantons and ant instantons using the identity are the ab d the sum over instantons and anti instantons can rewritten as j exp h i d j exp exp s march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton this result shows that the quantum energy eigenstates are the theta vacua n ein n their energy is k exp s as usual the width of the zone is on the order of the tunneling rate the lowest state corresponds to and has negative energy this is as it should be since the tunneling lowers the ground state energy at nonzero indeed it has an the vacuum is not t or cp invariant arrow of time the instanton amplitude has complex phase ei and anti instanton i in a world with nonzero there exists the so called gets the conjugate phase e witten eect electric and magnetic elds get admixed for example a magnetic monopole obtains some electric charge as well neutrons together with their usual magnetic moment obtain also an electric dipole so we do live in the bottom the lowest state of the show that cp symmetry is satised in strong interactions so it is obvious that all eects the vacuum energy are periodic in with period an interesting fact is that two brunches of the vacuum meet at crossing as shown schematically in fig the world with is t and cp even as instantons and anti instantons get the same phase and factor the two branches lead however to the double degenerate vacua and selecting one of them breaks t and cp symmetry spontaneously if one arranges domains of both types of vacuum they are separated with the topological object the domain wall the excitations living of this wall have been studied and provided interesting window into the qcd like theories compactied to dimensions fig vacuum energy versus theta schematically presence of light quarks aect theta vacua dramatically it is enough to say that if any quark avor be truly massless the fermionic determinant of all gauge the hunt for a nonzero electric dipole moment of the neutron the value of can not be changed within the qcd hypothetical new particles called axions were suggested to relax any theta vacuum to the bottom of the zone multiple searches for axions were made so far without success march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons would vanish this would mean that the elds congurations with global q whole theta zone would collapse into a single vacuum as theta depepdency would be erased in the real world however this is not the case the one loop correction to the instanton the bosonic minant the next natural step is the one loop calculation of the pre exponent in the neling amplitude in gauge theory this is a rather tedious calculation which was done in the classic paper by t hooft basically the procedure is completely analogous to what we did in the context of quantum mechanics the eld is expanded around the classical solution a acl a in qcd we have to make a gauge choice in this case it is most convenient to work in a background eld gauge we have to calculate the one loop determinants for gauge elds ghosts and sible matter elds which we will deal with later the determinants are divergent both in the ultraviolet like any other one loop graph and in the infrared due to the presence of zero modes as we will see below the two are actually related in fact the qcd beta function is only partly determined by the zero modes while in certain supersymmetric theories the beta function is completely determined by zero modes as we will discuss later first one has to deal with the zero modes of the system for two groups one has to deal with in practice electroweak su and qcd su let us enumerate them explicitly in both cases there are coordinates plus one size for su there are euler angle for rotations either in space or in color space does not matter as those are directly related thus for su group one simply do imbedding of the color solution into some subgroup of su out of n rotation angles one can see that only one does not aect the su instanton so there are angles and the integral over the zero mode is traded for an integral over the corresponding collective variable for each zero mode we get one factor of the jacobian the group integration is compact so it just gives a factor but the integral over size and position we have to keep as a result we get a dierential tunneling rate dni exp where the power of can be determined from dimensional the ultraviolet divergence is regulated using the pauli vilars scheme the only known method to perform instanton calculations the nal result can be converted into any other scheme using a perturbative calculation this means that the note that we for the rst time meet here anti de sitter space with the th coordinate being a scale it is the same as in famous maldacena duality march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton terminant det o of the dierential operator o is divided by m where m is the regulator mass since we have to extract zero modes from det o this gives a factor m in the numerator of the tunneling probability in addition to that there will be a logarithmic dependence on m coming from the ultraviolet divergence to one loop order it is just the logarithmic part of the polarization operator for any classical eld acl the result can be written as a contribution to the eective action brown and creamer sn zm in the background eld of an instanton the classical action cancels the prefactor now we can collect all terms in the exponent of sn zm and exp the tunneling rate m dni exp nc exp where we have recovered the running coupling constant thus the infrared and ultraviolet divergent terms combine to give the coecient of the one loop beta function and the bare charge and the regulator mass m can be combined into to a running coupling constant at two loop order the renormalization group requires the miracle to happen once again and the non zero mode determinant can be combined with the bare charge to give the two loop beta function in the exponent and the one loop running coupling in the pre exponent the remaining constant from the determinant of the non zero modes was lated in t hooft the result is dni exp nc exp the tunneling rate dna for anti instantons is of course identical using the one loop beta function the result can also be written as dni d and because of the large coecient the exponent overcomes the jacobian and small size instantons are strongly suppressed on the other hand there appears to be a divergence at large although the perturbative beta function is not applicable in this regime march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons propagators in the instanton background in the chapter on semiclassics we discussed a systematic semiclassical loop sion allowing to calculate the tunneling probability and vacuum energy order by order using feynman diagrams the same method may of course be used for qfts and the gauge theory in particular unfortunately the gauge theory instanton plitudes has not yet been calculated even to the two loop in this section we will discuss technical diculties related with such calculation as well as some ideas how to go around those the central objects we would need for feynman diagrams are of course the propagators of the relevant elds the quarks and gluons and perhaps ghosts in the instanton background as always the elds are written as classical plus quantum ones a a cl and the action expanding in powers of the latter the propagators or green functions are the inverse of the corresponding dierential operator dened by the quadratic form the technical problems mentioned are related to the fact that inversion can only be performed in a part of the functional space normal to zero modes but let us follow the problem methodically the st step is the calculation of a propagator for scalar particles both in fundamental and adjoint color tions they satisfy the equation with the covariant derivative containing the background eld of the instanton and so symbolically the scalar propagator is y y id i taaa y y there are no zero modes and the explicit solution was found by brown et al it is instructive to explain why they were able to do so the instanton potential in the singular gauge can be written as aa a ln a comparison some qcd quantities like vector current polarization operator is now calculated to loops march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton if the quantity in the square bracket is some general function and the eld is supposed to be self dual the condition on turns out to be the laplacian in which the usual derivative not the covariant one appears thus one can use it to generate a multi instanton solution of the i i the crucial observation is that the instanton potential has the form z which looks like pure gauge except that is not an unitary matrix and therefore the eld strength is not zero this features allows to factor the operator and therefore also factor out its inverse using ansatz y f y with dened above one can nally nd the form for the i f y note that it denes the scalar propagator not just for one instanton but for instanton solution of the form considered note also that at large distances y all the correction factors are small compared to one in them and the propagator reduces to free no background scalar propagator y y exercise check that it satises the equation the next step is getting the isospinor spinor quark propagator or more cisely its part normal to the zero mode this was achieved by using the fact that zero mode resign for one chirality only this leads to the form of the propagator snz d d and since the inverse of we know already the scalar propagator the task is accomplished just by dierentiation of it at this point the reader perhaps expects the gauge propagator to be obtained by similar tricks this is correct the symbolic expression for the vectror eld parameters one would nd that this can not be the most general multi instanton solution use here and elsewhere the d pauli matrix extension i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons propagator can indeed be written as d dnz the long derivatives at the left and right of the expression act on the middle of it the product of two inversions of should be understood as the convolution of two scalar propagators which includes the integration over some intermediate z namely d z y z z y x z where we used shorthand notations z z the trace is a certain nomial in components of x y z vectors so if the integral over z can somehow be calculated the propagator is obtained by dierentiation the problem remains that only some analytic limits of the convolution integral is analytically known not the complete integral the equation for the non zero mode vector green function has the explicit form dnz y p y i y i in which the r s is the projector to all non funciton minus projector to all zero modes zero modes it is a complete delta the instanton has of them translations scale transformation and euler angles of rotation all modes can be obtained by dierentiation over sponding collective coordinates already from the equation itself one can see a coming problem let us look at it at large distances from the instanton the operator in the l s becomes the ordinary laplacian and the r s has the large distance tails of the modes let us take one of them the scale one as example a scale the tail of the vector green function must be dnz since y if so the feynman diagrams involving d integrals of it can have bad infrared divergences x it has then been pointed out by levine and yae that this diculty can be eliminated by a redenition of orthogonality in hilbert space it can be dened with some weight function which can be chosen to decay with distance to be confused with the instanton center we also called z above currently we have a single instanton with the center at the origin march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton appropriately their improved propagator was shown to have no dnz x tail and yet neither these authors no anybody else used their improved propagator for four decades one of the methods for evaluation of the determinant namely its relation to the green function the reader may be reminded that the method was based on dierentiation of the classical solution over some parameter and relating the results to a one loop feynman diagram including the propagator which can be calculated if the latter is known a comment about adhm construction above sheds some light on how exact propagators in the eld of instanton or many instantons were calculated see the actual derivations in the original paper brown et al now in the case of the instanton there is indeed such parameter the size and the method can be applied in fact that method was used by brown and creamer brown and creamer for this purpose for the rst time one may expect that following this route one can cut o many diculties of the problem resolved by t hooft by brute force diagnalization brown and creamer were able to show that all uv divergencies occur as pected leading to the correct renormalized charge but attempting to calculate the nite part brown and creamer unexpectedly found infrared divergencies ming from projector normal to zero modes although the setting of next order calculations is in principle quite analogous to those we have discussed in quantum mechanical context in chapter semiclassical and even the diagrams are the same in all the years passed since the two loop correction to t hooft formula has not yet been calculated the exact nsvz beta function for supersymmetric theories at rst glance instanton amplitudes seem to violate supersymmetry the number of zero modes for gauge elds and fermions does not match while scalars have no zero modes at all we will however not discuss translation of the problem to a superspace and other related issues here sticking to the standard notation the remarkable fact is that the determination of the tunneling amplitude in susy gauge theory is actually simpler than in qcd furthermore one can determine the complete perturbative beta function from a generic calculation of the tunneling amplitude the tunneling amplitude in question is given by exp m ng nf d k where all factors can be understood from the t hooft calculation discussed above there are ng bosonic zero modes that have to be removed from the minant and give one power of the regulator mass m each similarly each of the nf fermionic zero modes gives a factor m introducing collective coordinates for march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons the bosonic zero modes gives a jacobian for every zero mode finally the last factor in the integral is related to fermionic collective coordinates and zero modes to be discussed a bit later and k is the power of needed to give the correct dimension here is the key observation supersymmetry ensures that spectra of eigenmodes for bosonic and fermionic uctuations around the instanton are related as a sult one can show that the non zero mode contributions in bosonic and fermionic determinants exactly cancel therefore there is no need to calculate them more precisely the subset of susy transformations which does not rotate the instanton eld itself mixes fermionic and bosonic modes non zero modes but hilates zero modes this is why all non zero modes cancel but zero modes can be unmatched note another consequence of the cancellation the power of m in the tunneling amplitude is an integer renormalizability demands that the tunneling amplitude is independent of the regulator mass this means that the explicit m of the tunneling tude and the m dependence of the bare coupling have to cancel as in qcd this lows us to determine the one loop coecient of the beta function nf again note that is an integer a result that would appear very mysterious if we did not know about instanton zero modes nc in supersymmetric theories one can even go one step further and determine the beta function to all loops novikov et al for that purpose let us write down the renormalized instanton measure exp m ng nf z ng g z d k where we have introduced the eld renormalization factors zg the bosonic fermionic elds again non renormalization theorems ensure that the neling amplitude is not renormalized at higher orders the cancellation between the non zero mode determinants persists beyond one loop for gluons the eld malization by denition is the same as the charge renormalization zg r furthermore supersymmetry implies that the eld renormalization is the same for gluinos and gluons this means that the only new quantity in is the lous dimension of the quark elds log zf log m for the renormalizability demands that all physical quantities such as the tude under consideration are independent of m all powers of m we found should dependence of the charge indeed the cuto of the thus be compensated by the m integrals at m implies that the original charge was in fact the bare one this condition gives the charge dependence on the scale which can be re formulated as the so called nsvz beta function novikov et al which in the case n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton reads the anomalous dimension of the quarks has to be calculated perturbatively to leading order it is given by nf nf n c nc as far as i know the result was checked by explicit calculations up to three in theories without quarks the nsvz result determines the beta function pletely for n supersymmetric gluodynamics we have n let us recognize several interesting special cases i for n the beta function vanishes and the theory is conformal the reason for that we already discussed in the chapter on monopoles where it was shown that this theory is electric magnetic self dual the case n shows another curious phenomenon the non trivial part of the denominator vanishes so that the one loop result for the beta function becomes exact this theory is the one partially solved by seiberg and witten we will follow the charge running in it in the next section the next interesting case is the n susy qcd where we add nf matter elds quarks and squarks in the fundamental representation let us rst look at the nsvz beta function the beta function vanishes at nf n where we have used the one loop anomalous dimension this c and nf in the is small which we can ensure by choosing nc is reliable if g conformal window nf seiberg showed that the conformal point exists for all nf in the conformal window even if nc is not large and claried the structure of the theory at the conformal point this is a phenomenon which also exists in qcd like theories with many fermions another observation is that for n the beta function blows up at nc so the renormalization group trajectory can not be extended beyond this point the meaning of it remains mysterious to me note that the beta function is scheme dependent beyond two loops so in order to make a comparison with high order perturbative calculations one has to translate from the pauli vilars scheme to a more standard perturbative scheme e m s march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons instanton induced contribution to the renormalized charge specic running of the coupling in non abelian gauge theories the asymptotic freedom gave birth to qcd and so it is not surprising that higher order corrections to the original celebrated one loop result had attracted a lot of attention current knowledge of perturbative corrections can be found in the appendix but one should not necessarily think only about the uv divergences in tive diagrams while considering the renormalized coupling constant let me give two examples one very simple and one very complex my rst example are feynman diagrams in quantum mechanical dimensional path integrals say with interaction term there are many loop diagrams renormalizing operators but there are no divergences and uv logarithms sym and also the second example conceptually simple but technically challenging is the case of d superconformal eld theories scft s we mentioned two of them before supersymmetric qcd scft have zero n beta functions and thus unlike qcd no parameter there is a bare coupling in the lagrangian which is however dierent from the true coupling g in certain exactly known observables the relation between them can be expanded in the instanton series for details see et al marshakov et al n let us however return to qcd like theories with the running coupling a charge is dened by general ope rules as a coecient in front of the operator in the action where general rules dene the eld g as the soft one containing only fourier harmonics with p all hard phenomena with p are supposed to be delegated to the coecient all non perturbative phenomena and in particular instantons with suciently small size need to be included in the running charge the dierence between the perturbative and non perturbative series is that the former are series in while the latter in inverse powers of let us discuss the running coupling in a number of theories following the paper by randall ratazzi and myself randall et al the best known case is the sym theory in which one knows both the exact analytic expression for the n charge dependence on the scalar vev a from seiberg witten elliptic curve see and also its perturbative nonperturbative series which start as appendix follows a where the dots do not include high loop logs they vanish in this theory as shown in the previous section but higher powers of the instanton terms the number in power the same as the coecient of is nothing but the loop coecient of the beta function see nsvz result discussed above all terms have been explicitly calculated by nekrasov nekrasov and they conrm the expansion of the seiberg witten elliptic curve a this expression of course should only be used when the second term is much march wspc book trim size for in in allinone tunneling in gauge theories and the bpst instanton fig the eective charge bgef where is the one loop coecient of the beta function versus normalization scale in units of its value at which the one loop charge blows up the thick solid line correspond to exact solution for the sym the thick dashed line shows the one instanton correction lines with symbols as indicated on gure stand for qcd like theories and pure gauge ones and qcd itself thin long dashed and short dashed lines are one and tho loop results smaller than the rst but one can still make a tempting observation since they are of the opposite sign perhaps at some scale the r s vanishes which means that the coupling gets innite according to seiberg witten it is indeed the case but the singularity is at a place slightly misplaced compared to what one would get from those two terms in fig from randall et al the exact answer solid think line is pared with the one instanton expression the thin dashed line the qcd curves correspond to the ope denition blog a a n including the instanton density with the size extracted either from lattice lations or models both to be discussed below the bottom line is that in all cases one nds a very similar behavior at certain scale the instanton induced power term is rapidly switched in and increases the coupling this explains why the transition from weak to strong coupling happens rather abruptly march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons single instanton eects quarkonium potential and scattering amplitudes the simplest eects we will describe simply utilize relatively strong gluonic elds of

similarly zahed and myself shuryak and zahed have generalized this calculation to instanton induced static dipole dipole potential or the interaction between two quarkonia before describing it let me remind the situation in qed according to famous casmir polder paper the interaction of two distant dipole is v r where i are the so called polarizabilities note that it is not a square of the dipole eld the dierence comes from the time delay let me briey reproduce this result in euclidean setting we use for simplicity let us only consider the case when dipoles are small r in this case dipole approximation is justied both gluons photons are emitted at close time and the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons fig the setting of the dipole dipole potential calculation two gluon exchange and induced correlator to consider is its integral over relative time leads to casmir polder answer just mentioned the correlator of two elds squared in the instanton background is calculated using its expression the averaging over the instanton location can be carried out analytically we then get the so called correlation function to be discussed systematically in the next chapter it is important to point out that while in the quarkonium potential the induced eect is relatively small compared to the perturbative one gluon exchange it is in fact dominant in the dipole dipole case for r see fig this is a manifestation of a general trend the higher is the order of the eect in tion theory the more important instanton induced eects become indeed because the instanton eld is g the coupling to a quark is cancelled out and extra exchanges go for free without any additional penalty the only small factor in the problem is then the instanton

in euclidean space time with the angle between the wilson lines and later analytically continue the result into the minkowski world by the substitution iy where y is the minkowski rapidity dierence between the colliding objects it has been checked in shuryak and zahed and elsewhere that in that it works correctly for perturbative amplitudes we used it for quark and dipole dipole scattering amplitudes as well nowak et al shuryak and zahed the setting for the latter case is shown in fig strictly speaking a mutial scattering of two small dipoles correspond to ble deep inelastic scattering for example future lepton collider can be used as a collider of two virtual photons the quark antiquark pair produced by the qcd tons have small sizes but in practice the parton enesemble is often represented as a set of dipoles and even the proton itself sometimes is treated as a color dipole made of quark and diquark for the details about instanton induced eect in scattering amplitudes see the papers mentioned q provided each photon is highly virtual q fermionic transitions during changes of gauge topology the fermionic zero mode of the instanton the so called index theorems connect topology of the manifold with the number of zero modes of the dirac operator dened on them without going into details let march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic transitions during changes of gauge topology me just say that if the gauge eld has the topological charge q then i the fundamental isoscalar fermions e quarks should have q zero modes ii the adjoint isovector fermions e gluinoes of supersymmetric gauge theories should have qnc zero modes the meaning of these facts are very profound with important consequences for instanton induced eects we will be discussing let us rst look at the explicit form of the zero mode originally discovered by t hooft t hooft it is a solution of the dirac equation in the instanton eld for an instanton in the singular gauge the zero mode wave function take the form where m is a constant in which the su color index is coupled to the spin index m let us briey digress in order to show that is indeed a solution of the dirac equation first observe g we can now use the fact that g g implies l for anti self dual elds in the case of a self dual gauge potential the dirac equation then l l r for anti self dual elds since is a positive and vice operator r has to vanish and the zero mode in the background eld of an instanton has to be left handed while it is right handed in the case of an anti instanton this indeed there is a mathematical theorem the result is not an accident nr for every species of chiral singer index theorem that requires that q nl fermions a general analysis of the solutions of was given in t hooft for multi instanton gauge potentials of the form aa log the solution is of the form a m m the dirac equation requires to be a harmonic function using this result it is straightforward to verify again we can obtain an su can therefore be called spinor hedgehog the norm is such that this mode is normalized to use euclidean dirac matrices that satisfy we also will use the following combinations of gamma matrices and march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons solution by embedding the su result it is also important that there is no chirality partner for zero modes the ing theorem for and modes holds for non zero modes only so what was wrong with the proof of course the assumption that can be used as another eigenvector it would not work for purely chiral solutions so what the existence of the zero mode mean for the tunneling rate at the rst glance zero mode is a problem since it vanishes the fermionic determinant in the partition function deed the determinant is of the operator i m and since the former term gives zero on a zero mod one has to conclude that for massless fermions the tunneling probability vanishes not necessarily argued t hooft since the mass term can be supplemented by external scalar current what it all means there is no tunneling unless a qrql pair for each massless avor is produced still the whole process looks very mysterious the nal demystication of the anomaly is as follows one can follow the tunneling congurations adiabatically and for each value of time we are looking for static energy levels of the dirac particle and ignoring all time derivatives one then nds that the levels move in such a way that all left handed states make one step down to the next level and all right handed ones make one step up a hint that this is the case can be explained as follows in the adiabatic approximation slow change in time the time dependent solution is t if energy is positive for large t and negative for t the corresponding dependent wave function is dimensionally normalizable the explicit t hooft zero mode is such a normalizable solution thus if only one such solution exists it means that only one state has passed the zero energy mark so when tunneling is nished the spectrum is of course the same but it is the level occupation which is dierent electroweak instantons violate baryon and lepton numbers briey about the electroweak instantons very little changes in terms of formulae are need while the numbers involved are drastically dierent the higgs vev sets a scale and therefore instanton size also get xed t hooft the charge at electroweak scale is small and therefore the probability of tunneling is now extremely small p exp w so it seems out of question that one can observe any manifestations of it however it is still important to discuss what should happen if one observes the consequences of electroweak instanton unlike qcd weak gauge elds are only coupled to left handed fermions so there is no cancellation of the anomaly by march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic transitions during changes of gauge topology right handed fermion loop for vector current it is not therefore conserved as well as the axial current let us think what it implies unlike chirality in qcd we now have vation of the baryon b and lepton l numbers more specically an instanton must generate production of quarks colors times generations and leptons or b l the dierence b l is thus conserved while electroweak instantons tunneling are unobservable the corresponding sphaleron transitions at nite temperature electroweak plasma are much more able they have quark and lepton zero modes and generate similar process to be discussed in the sphaleron chapter instanton induced t hooft eective

the quark elds the green s function is given by the tunneling amplitude multiplied by nf fermion propagators it is shown schematically in fig fig the green function left for nf at large distances can be seen as a local operator v with free propagators shown by the dotted lines the free propagators can be amputated it would be important to introduce also quark mass m same for all as a ir regulator every propagator has a zero mode contribution with one power of the fermion mass in the denominator y i m y i m y march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons where i have written the zero mode contribution separately note that if both points y are far from the instanton center relative to one can use asymptotic expression for which at large arguments behave as constant spinor times since this behavior is nothing else but just free propagator for a massless fermion one sees that in this limit the rst term can be interpreted as two free propagators from to z and from y to z times some constant vertex the procedure we have described is in fact standard amputation of external legs of the green functions used when one would like to derive the eective vertex or lagrangian let us now look at the dependence on the light quark masses suppose there are nf light quark avors and all masses are the same the instanton amplitude is proportional to mnf or more generally to due to the fermionic minant in the weight but contributions of the zero modes in the propagators give us mnf as a result the zero mode contribution to the green s function is nite in the chiral m fig the instanton induced t hooft vertex a for avor qcd versus the ordinary gluon exchange diagrams note a very dierent chiral structure of the two the latter does not violate any chiral symmetry because chirality is conserved along each line that green s functions involving more than legs are not singular as m the pauli principle always ensures that no more than quarks can propagate in zero mode states march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic transitions during changes of gauge topology the result can be written in terms of a new eective lagrangian t hooft it is a local vertex where the quarks are emitted or absorbed in the independent spinor states obtained after the amputation of the free motion from the zero mode wave functions limx as shown in the right of fig one may wish to simplify this general fairly complicated vertex first if tons are uncorrelated one can average over their orientation in color space for su color and nf the result is lnf d m qrql where is the tunneling rate without fermions note that the zero mode tribution acts like a mass term this is quite natural because for nf there is only one chiral u symmetry which is anomalous unlike the case nf the anomaly can therefore generate a fermion mass term for nf the result is uraul lnf m qf rqf l d dradl l where the a are color gell mann matrices one can easily check that the interaction is su su invariant but u is broken this means that the t hooft lagrangian provides another derivation of the u anomaly furthermore we will argue below that the importance of this interaction goes much beyond the anomaly and that it explains the physics of chiral symmetry breaking and the spectrum of light hadrons any multi fermion operator can be identically rewritten using the so called fierz identities grouping fermions into various possible pairs for fermion operators there are pairings possible fermion paired with any of remaining therefore nf t hooft lagrangian can be written in dierent but identical forms one or the other may be more or less convenient for particular problem but various forms in literature may create some confusion following rapp et al we give

antisymmetric in indices this is what subscript a indicate like mesons the rst two terms have a sign opposite to the last one it implies that to rst order the scalar and vector diquarks get mass corrections of the opposite sign the spin is going down spin up the eective lagrangian is a kind of non local vertex in which either quarks scatter on each other or a pair of quarks is produced from

so it turns out that the uu dd interaction is about twice larger than others so in eects caused by these operators the avor su symmetry is violated at level finally in order to complete the eects of light quarks on the tunneling we need to include the eects of non zero modes one eect is that the coecient in the beta function is changed to in addition to that there is an overall constant that was calculated in t hooft carlitz and creamer nf where we have also specied the next order correction in the quark mass note that at two loop order one not only gets the two loop beta function in the

in in allinone fermionic transitions during changes of gauge topology instanton induced quark congurations in the cleon this subsection just introduce this important subject more detailed discussion of it will be continued in chapter devoted to hadronic wave functions on the light front in fig we show the simplest valence quark nucleon conguration a gether with the lowest order instanton induced eects the diagram b illustrate the ud diquark correlation appearing in the rst order in t hooft lagrangian since the diquark has spin zero the quark in it does not contribute to the total spin of the nucleon this conclusion is supported by lattice studies the attention to the last diagram c comes from the paper dorokhov and kochelev where it was noted that sea quarks produced by instantons and resulting in the quark conguration are highly polarized both in spin and isospin indeed the valence u quark can only produce d s ones avor polarization furthermore if this quark happens to be right handed the sea quark pair would be left handed and vice versa in that paper this conguration was proposed as an explanation of observed deviations from ellis jae and gottfried sum rules related to the famous spin crisis of the nucleon note that the instanton induced production of sea quarks is very dierent from the usual one gluon vertex creating qq pairs which is obviously avor and blind thus the usual pqcd evolution of structure functions while dominant at very small can not start from simple valence quark distributions and needs metric phenomenological input instanton induced decays of c and scalar pseudoscalar balls fig the instanton induced decay of the pseudoscalar c march wspc book trim size for in in allinone gauge eld topology and instantons it let me here provide one example which we would not discuss in detail was noticed by bjorken bjorken that decays of c has large body modes about each of the total width c kk note that there is no decay mode or many other decay modes one may think of that is because t hooft vertex must have all light quark avors including the ss see fig more generally in fact the average multiplicity of j c decays is signicantly larger than so large probability of these body decays is a phenomenon by itself bjorken pointed out that the vertex seems to be uu ddss and suggested that these decays proceed via t hooft vertex the actual calculations were done by zetocha and schafer it included the following two and three mesons decays channels of the lowest charmonium state c using the lagrangian shown in fig kk kk fig the form of the nf eective t hooft lagrangian their results contain rather high power of the instanton radius and therefore strongly depend on its value so the authors used the inverted logic evaluating from each data point the corresponding value of the mean instanton size the results reasonably well reproduced the ratios between the channels and even the absolute width furthermore these calculations provide about the most

during changes of gauge topology instanton induced spin polarization in heavy ion collisions heavy ion collisions create new form of matter quark gluon plasma qgp which epands and cools according to relativistic hydrodynamics this eld is rich and will be discussed in a separate lecture volume however one particular nomenon ts here so well that i decided to include it the point is noncentral collisions lead to large orbital momentum and consequently to uid undergoing rotational motion with a nonzero vorticity if one goes to rotational frame vorticity act as magnetic eld and in thermal equilibrium the spin states get polarized p exp the observation of hyperon polarization has been observed by star collaboration at rhic adamczyk et al this story may look boring unless one asks the question of how exactly a spin can get equilibrated by rotating medium investigation of this by kapusta et al started with reactions induced by thermal ow uctuations with disappointment it was found that this mechanism can only equilibrate spins at times longer than m c obviously not available in practice in the collisions then it ws shown that perturbative amplitude of strange quark spin ip proportional to strange quark mass ms also leads to unreasonably long equilibration time therefore kapusta et al in desperation eventually turn their attention to nonperturbative qcd they used quark operators obtained from quark t hooft operator and instanton liquid model parameters which does indeed produce resonable time for spin equilibration note however that reduction of quark operator involves nonzero quark condensates and therefore is only possible not in the qgp phase but only at t tc in hadronic phase this implies that spin polarization only occurs late in the collision in principle spin polarization can be observed not only for hyperon but for many other hadron species like vector mesons or s baryons like in a comment i suggested the latter to be a good way to tell apart the eect of vorticity from that of magnetic eld eventually one should be able to compare polariization of light to strange quarks and compare it to predictions from t hooft operator at the time of this writing there appeared measurements of spin ization for strange vector mesons k but there is no understandingof how are they related with local vorticity magnetic eld yet march wspc book trim

measure global topology we will discuss in this rst section is the total topological charge of the whole lattice in the subsequent sections we will review more local observables aimed at revealing the topological substructure of the gauge theory vacuums the overall uctuations of the topological charge can be deduced from lattice measurements of the so called topological susceptibility dened by top where is the volume in which the topological charge q is measured we will not go into technical details about the topological charge denitions on the lattice and just notice that with proper denition q is always integer valued lattice congurations provide histograms of the probabilities p q used in the averaging implied in the denition if it would be gaussian the only parameter would be top related to its width the non gaussian distributions possess higher moments the so called tion parameter is dened by the ratio of the following moments of the q distribution via if one thinks that topological charge is contained in an ensemble of instantons top provides the combined density of instantons and antiinstantons below we will focus on its dependence on the temperature t but one should also study its dependence on other parameters such as the quark masses mf and the number of colors nc dilute instanton gas approximation diga provides some predictions we will discuss the total

to powers of theta one nds prediction for higher order coecients in particular the value of is dened by bdiga the interaction between instantons will inuence this parameter and so there were devoted measurements on the lattice of course it would be nice to directly simulate the ensemble at nonzero but it is not possible because of the complex weight one method used to go around this is to do simulations for imaginary i the chemical potential conjugated to the topological charge and then extrapolate back from imaginary to real one signicant eorts have been invested in studies of the dependence of these rameters on the number of colors n in particular top for three four and six colors bonati et al the results provide a robust evidence of the large n in behavior predicted by standard large n scaling arguments i e particular n n in qcd with light quarks one can study the dependence of these parameters on the quark masses recall that gauge elds with nonzero q have fermionic zero the determinant is zero and thus those congurations are modes so if m as well we have noticed before that to impossible so in the massless limit vanish top in fact it is enough that a single quark avor be massless for mu md and ignoring strangeness the chiral perturbation theory gives f m ev which does indeed vanish in the massless limit by lattice mqf all of that is reproduced topological susceptibility in qcd at nite t has been studied in et al from which we took the following fig let us start with the second plot displaying the interaction parameter note that at low t it is very dierent from the diga prediction but at high t it does go to an agreement with to the dilute gas prediction however that diga would predict much stronger vanishing since the instanton

zero t while the dashed line is the diction from nite temperature chpt and the dashed dotted line shows the slope predicted by diga computation the band corresponds to the continuum extrapolation using the function t t only data corresponding to t have been used in the t b evaluated at three lattice spacing the horizontal solid lines correspond to the value of at t predicted by chpt which is about and to the instanton gas expected value bdiga the dotted dashed line is the prediction of nite temperature chpt while the light blue band is the result of a t to the smallest lattice spacing data the rst plot shows that in the qgp phase does have a power dependence on t but the tted power on the other hand diga predicts t t nf m t the power of the temperature thus should with nf be shown on the plot by dash dotted curve thus there is a very serious disagreement we will return to its discussion in the next chapters at the other hand another lattice group borsanyi et al had measured m ev in this range drops by about orders up to much higher t of magnitude this group nally does see at high t the dependence corresponding to diga their tted power of t is close to the power from the beta function for quark avors u d s march wspc book trim size for in in allinone topology on the lattice since their method basically included only congurations with total charge q which means they kept a single instanton in a box no doubt the result agrees with a single instanton amplitude what would be important to test is the coecient given by the semiclassical calculation to my knowledge the coecient does not agree with expectations being about an order of magnitude larger than the prediction in view of high power of qcd involved and the fact that it is only one loop prediction available it is perhaps not yet a problem but the issue clearly needs more work fig the topological susceptibility versus temperature for qcd with physical quark masses the insert shows the dependence around the deconnement phase transition cooling and instantons lattice eld congurations are not of course classical they do include the full extent of quantum uctuations of all elds but the tools used to reveal the underlying topology are basically the same cooling and gradient ow the simplest method to look for topological object on the lattice is cooling an iterative procedure reducing local values of the gauge action indeed the topological solitons represent local extrema minima of the action and thus those should be approached under cooling the rst works teper ilgenfritz et al applying cooling had indeed found topological lumps with their action being equal up to a sign to the topological charge s further works have however found certain technical issues which made hard to make really quantitative results from cooling one is that the results obtained pend on the number of cooling steps the reason is that close instanton antiinstanton q march wspc book trim size for in in allinone cooling and instantons pairs move toward each other and eventually annihilate trying to locate and clude such annihilation events made the cooling studies more an art than a regular method of similar nature is the question of topological defects instanton like objects in order to dene the topological with a size comparable to lattice spacing a charge lattice discretized elds should be made continuous by some extrapolation procedures which unfortunately by denition are not unique the other issue is the fact that only in the continuum limit the instanton tion becomes scale independent on the lattice there is no scale invariance and depending on particular choice of the lattice action one can force instantons either to grow or shrink as the cooling proceeds this issue has been addressed using the impoved lattice actions de forcrand et al without going into detail let me just say that with tuning it one can tune the term in the instanton action to prevent changes of the instanton size during cooling this allowed to measure the instanton density with the size the average size was found to be m somewhat larger than in the instanton liquid model m distribution of separation the distribution have also clear peak at max between instantons have a clear peak at m close to what the instanton liquid model value in fig we show two more examples of the vacuum topological structure later works included extrapolation back to no cooling time allowed careful determination of the density and size distributions in pure gauge su su and even physical qcd with quarks hasenfratz the average size was found to m a bit smaller than in the ilm the mean distance was found be instead to be m lattice data on the instanton size distribution are shown in fig the gure is taken from shuryak the lattice data from a hasenfratz et al the left plot shows the size distribution itself recall that the semiclassical theory predict at small sizes with for pure gauge nc it to be dn d theory the right plot in which this power is taken out is constant at small rho which agrees with the semiclassical prediction b the other feature is a peak at m the value rst proposed logically in shuryak long before these lattice data the reason for the peak is a suppression at large sizes trying to understand its origin one may factor out all known eects the right plot shows that after this is done a rather simple suppression factor describes it well for about decades what can the physical origin of this suppression be const exp there is no clear answer to that question one option is that it is due to mutual the measurements started from some threshold value of min but semiclassical theory tells us that only very negligible number of instantons can be below this threshold march wspc book trim size for in in allinone topology on the lattice fig the topological structure revealed by cooling of lattice gauge congurations four upper plots are from the mit group by negele et al they show the distributions of the action g g left and right the upper plots are before and the lower ones after cooling the lower picture of the topological charge is from the adelaide group leinweber et al lower gg and topological charge repulsion between instantons and antiinstantons we will return to it in section where we will discuss theory of the instanton liquid another one proposed in ref shuryak already mentioned is that the coecient is proportional to the dual magnetic condensate that of bose condensed monopoles it has been further argued there that it can be related to the string tension so that the suppression factor should be dn d dn d e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone cooling and instantons left the instanton size distribution dn fig right the combination in which the main one loop behavior drops out for nc nf the points are from the lattice work for this theory with diamonds squares and circles their comparison should demonstrate that results are lattice independent the line corresponds to the proposed expression see text if this idea is correct this suppression factor should be missing at t tc in which the dual magnetic condensate is absent but on the other hand here tum thermal uctuations generate at high t a similar factor pisarski and yae dn d dn d e t related to scattering of quarks and gluons of qgp on the instanton shuryak and velkovsky empirically the suppression factor at all temperature looks sian in interpolating between those limiting cases another example of lattice study focusing on instanton contribution to certain green functions is ref athenodorou et al in full quantum vacuum and with cooling the original motivation has been extraction of the gluon coupling so the observable on which this work was focused i d the following ratio of point to point green function in congurations transformed to landau gauge m om k in fig the results are plotted versus the momentum scale at the lower curve corresponding to uncooled quantum vacuum with gluons at large k gev the eective coupling starts running downward as asymptotic freedom requires one nds certain positive power its slope was however in infrared at low k found to be exactly what one would obtain from an instanton ensemble more after cooling for dierent time shown by three other curves it was seen that the same power also persists at high k gev as well see dashed curves march wspc book trim size for in in allinone topology on the lattice fig the ratio of green functions m om k versus momentum scale dierent color of points correspond to dierent cooling time the lines correspond to the instanton ensembles with tted densities at the right this corresponds well to the expectation that cooling eliminates perturbative gluons the plain waves but for some time preserve instantons the authors notice that this power corresponds well to that calculated from instantons the ratio dened above calculated for ensemble of instantons reads where the function containing the instanton size is m om k s a certain bessel transform of the shape function to compare the bpst stanton has the gradient ow cooling allowed to identify instantons quite well as shown in fig the topological charge density at the center depends on the tted size in a way quite close to that of bpst instantons while with the cooling time the instanton sizes grow one should remember to to recover how they were in the original extrapolate to zero cooling time quantum vacuum therefore this density is not what one can calculate from the right plot of fig but signicantly larger their extrapolated total density is m an order of magnitude larger than in the original ilm march wspc book trim size for in in allinone constrained cooling preserving the polyakov line fig left the topological charge at the origin vs the tted radius compared to the bpst prole shown by the line right evolution of the instanton size distribution with the cooling time extrapolating these results back to zero cooling the authors used these data for an estimate of the vacuum instanton density their conclusion is that it is much higher than the value suggested by the instanton liquid model by about an order of magnitude if so it erases the diluteness parameter of that ensemble making the instanton liquid really dense constrained cooling preserving the polyakov line from the introduction chapter we emphasized that the vev of the polyakov line does play a very important role in non perturbative phenomena it is used as the most practical connement measure and as we discussed in the introduction it inuences the instantons eectively splitting them into the instanton dyons we will discuss later so it is rather natural following langfeld and ilgenfritz to work out the so called the so called constrained cooling with the local values of the polyakov line preserved for technical denition how it is achieved one need to see the original paper let me show only two plots in fig the left gure compares the behavior of the topological susceptibility top on the amount of the cooling steps while the standard method shows a global topology disappearing the constrained cooling does preserve it let me briey summarize the main ndings of langfeld and ilgenfritz as follows while the global topological charge q is quantized to integer values the actions and the topological charges of local topological clusters do not so they can not really be instantons on the other hand they satisfy another major requirements the elds in these clusters is locally selfdual the picture in the right side of fig shows also that they are well localized and thus their elds are quite strong those features still suggest that the objects are topological and that their semiclassical treatment looks march wspc book trim size for in in allinone promising topology on the lattice fig the left plot shows the topological susceptibility top as a function of the number of cooling sweep ncool for standard red points decreasing with ncool and constrained black points the right plot shows the distribution of the topological charge in congurations obtained by the constrained cooling march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter instanton ensembles qualitative introduction to the instanton ensembles in the previous chapter we have discussed the semiclassical theory of a single stanton together with some applications of it however since the translational zero modes are substituted by an integral over collective coordinates the ton location in d the tunneling amplitude for an instanton is proportional to the volume considered this means that if is large enough to overcome the exponential tunneling suppression naive probability of tunneling exceeds and re summing unitarization of the probability is necessary as was shown in the previous chapter simple exponentiation of the amplitude leads to ideal instanton gas the instanton density is directly related to the non perturbative downward shift in vacuum energy density the so called diluteness i describes how far instantons are from each other in units of their size when it is large enough this ideal gas approximation does not hold and one naturally needs to take into account instanton interactions this section is about dierent regimes in which the instanton ensemble may exist before we describe them in detail let us just enumerate them in historical order i a gas of individual instantons ii a gas of pairs the instanton antiinstanton molecules iii the instanton liquid iv the instanton polymers producing quasibound cooper quark pairs of color superconding phases the discussion is qualitative which means we ignore numerical factors as well as the ence between and march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles the rst two are dilute ensembles as their density can be arbitrarily small so that the interaction between constituents can be safely neglected we will discuss those in the next subsection the last two are not only dense in the sense that the interaction needs to be accounted for but is in fact dense enough for certain qualitative changes in the system to take place the instanton liquid is a phase in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken so that there is a nonzero quark condensate qq the color supercondor phase has nonzero condensate of diquarks it may or may not also include qq depending on details of the setting the value of the condensate inuences back the instanton density these eters are all found from minimization of the free energy in a mean eld tion the free energy is approximated by certain analytic expressions its derivatives over parameters set to zero are known as the gap equations their solution may or may not be done analytically we will discuss those in the rest of this chapter fig schematic representation of four instanton ensembles for nf see text red and blue circles correspond to instantons and anti instantons black and green lines to u quarks black diamonds are mass insertions ipping chirality from left l to right r the dilute gas of individual instantons at high t the larger size instantons are screened out so only those with sizes t qcd t are that is why the dimensionless diluteness of the ensemble should depend on t as large inverse power question at this point usually comes if the size should be instead limited by the electric debye gt however there is no g in the condition above because classical instanton eld mass md is large g march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the dilute gas of individual instantons furthermore in qcd with light quarks the dilute instanton gas is made far more diluted by the existence of fermionic zero modes in the chiral limit mq any object with nonzero topological charge q taken by itself should have q fermionic zero modes recall that in the qcd partition function the fermionic determinant is in the numerator so zero eigenvalue make it to vanish thus in the chiral limits there simlply can not exist any dilute instanton gas if one take into account niteness of quark masses the dilute instanton gas is possible but with rather small density we will call it the t hooft regime as we already discussed in the previous chapter in this case the instanton amplitude is additionally on top of the tunneling exponent suppressed by product of all light quark masses this factor is numerically about u d s m ev m ev m ev m ev m ev m ev where we put the mean instanton size for dimension its numerical value will be extensively discussed below in this chapter if all instanton eect in qcd would be that small perhaps there would not be a need to discuss them fortunately this regime only occurs at high temperatures t tc rst indications for that has been recently demonstrated on the lattice recall that these mass insertions appear in the single instanton amplitude cause all quarks emitted via zero modes need to be reabsorbed back fig zero modes for a quark and an antiquark have opposite chiralities and the price for ipping it is the mass insertion but such chirality ips are not needed if a quark emitted by an instanton is absorbed by an anti instanton instantons therefore these other phases can exist even in the chiral limit mf in other ensembles a quark emitted by an instanton can be absorbed by if the density is high and a quark emitted by an instanton can with comparable probability be absorbed by multiple antiinstantons see fig this ensemble is called the instanton liquid shuryak the fermionic determinant is a sum of closed loops so if one follows one particular say u quark it will always come back in the instanton liquid ensemble a typical length of the loop is very long scaling with the volume what this means is that it gets innite in the limit and thus su nf chiral symmetry gets spontaneously broken we will have a chapter devoted to it soon if the density is low the simplest loop is a travel to the nearest antiinstanton and back see fig this ensemble is called a molecular phase made of antiinstanton pairs ilgenfritz and shuryak transition from the option the instanton liquid to ii pairs as a function of t is the instanton based explanation for the chiral symmetry restoration the last ensemble iv produces condensates of quark cooper pairs in cold but its physics is rather similar to the so called beresinsky kosterlitz thouless transition with the dimensional vortices for which the nobel prize was awarded march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles dense quark matter thus it is called the instanton induced color superconductor in which there is a nonzero vev depending on the parameters it may exist in several interesting phases unfortunately we will not have time for its discussion in these lectures the instanton liquid model ilm complementing the theory built from rst principles one may also look at the phenomena under consideration from empirical point of view searching for hints and combining those into a simple approximate model it is precisely what happened in the early s by that time the qcd sum rules shifman et al has been widely used and they provided some understanding of the behavior of the qcd correlation functions combining partonic description at small distances with hadronic description at large ones one learned what happens in between furthermore using wilsonian operator product expansion ope one was able to qualitatively understand the correlator phenomenology in terms of vev s of few vacuum condensates the gluonic and quark qq ones some of that we will discuss in chapter on cd correlation funcitons furthermore as it was pointed out by the authors of the method themselves not all hadrons are alike for spin zero channels the ope based theory apparently failed to predict the magnitude of the non perturbative eects even qualitatively in order to explain available phenomenology of the vacuum a qualitative model was proposed in my work shuryak the so called instanton liquid model ilm of the cd vacuum there were two parameters the mean instanton size and the instanton density n to be determined phenomenologically the instanton size distribution was assumed to be just dn d an idea what instanton density in the qcd vacuum can be was taken from the empirical value of the gluon condensate nc where the density means both pseudosparticles together i and i to evaluate the typical size one more observable was used the quark condensate in a version of mean eld estimate the result was m m ev it was soon found that this model can reproduce well also other properties of chiral symmetry breaking such as the pion decay constant f i then proceeded forward march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles calculating many dierent correlation functions shuryak including those where the ope sum rules failed and found that the model reproduces ogy in those channels as well while this model historically originated from studies of the hadronic nomenology and related correlation functions most of its elements have been studied directly from gauge eld congurations generated in lattice numerical simulations therefore we will not follow the historical path but discuss rst certain lattice results yet to have certain picture in mind let me still summarize here some important qualitative features of this model the diluteness parameter is small where r is the typical distance between the pseudoparticles so only few per cent of the space time is occupied by strong eld the factorization hypothesis is thus violated by the inverse diluteness semiclassical formulae are applicable the action of the typical instanton is large enough quantum corrections go as and are presumably small enough the interaction does not destroy instantons estimated by the dipole mula interaction was found to be typically it is a liquid not a gas the interaction is not small in the statistical mechanics of instantons on the contrary correlations are strong exp statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles early attempts to relate instantons with practical applications to qcd were marized by important paper by callan dashen and gross callan et al corporating the dipole like forces between instantons and antiinstantons they have tried to create a self consistent theory of interacting after witten pointed out diculties in approaching the large nc limit using but soon this groups switched to so called merons half instantons using which they have tempted to explain connement this idea did not work but in some way predated the dyons to be discussed below took many years till the issue was claried by instanton ensemble simulations see discussion to follow later march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles this princeton group abandoned this direction and switched to this limit of qcd in a simple model shuryak with the xed instanton size and density was propose since the instantons in it were considered uncorrelated it was called random instanton liquid model rilm for short while it was cally quite successful some consistent many body theory of the instanton ensemble was of course needed the rst step was a simplied hard core model by ilgenfritz and preussker ilgenfritz and muller preussker the second was the variational approach by diakonov and petrov diakonov and petrov for a sum ansatz congurations the gauge potential equal to a sum of those for individual instantons and anti instantons in a singular gauge classical interaction was calculated and the approximation mfa of the statistical mechanics the interaction was quite repulsive leading to quite dilute equilibrium ensemble inclusion of light quarks has followed diakonov and petrov which lead to the rst calculation of the quark condensate also in the mean eld approximation the accuracy of the mean eld approach remained however unclear as the quark induced interactions between instantons are very strong and expected to produce strong correlations between them more direct and accurate methods have to be developed to treat the cal ensemble which was done in a series of papers started with shuryak this approach was called the interacting instanton liquid model iilm it uses the combined fermionic determinant for all instantons which is is equivalent to including the diagrams containing t hooft eective lagrangian to all first the experimentally known correlation functions were reproduced by the model at small distances at a quantitative level then for many mesonic channels shuryak and verbaarschot shuryak and verbaarschot signicant numerical eorts were made allowing to calculate the relevant correlation functions till larger distances about fm where they decay by few decades as a results the predictive power of the model has been explored in substantial depth many the coupling constants and even hadronic masses were calculated with good agreement with experiment and lattice subsequent calculations of baryonic correlators schafer et al has revealed further surprising facts in the instanton vacuum the nucleon was shown to be made of a constituent quark plus a deeply bound diquark with a mass nearly the same as that of constituent quarks on the other hand decuplet baryons like had shown no such diquarks remaining weakly bound set of three constituent quarks to my knowledge it was the rst dynamical explanation of deeply bound scalar quarks while being a direct consequence of t hooft lagranigian this phenomenon has been missed for a long time it also lead to realization that diquarks can become cooper pairs in dense quark matter see schafer and shuryak for a review strictly speaking for all orders which included all in a box few hundreds note that the number of diagrams is of the order n and is huge typically n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles on color superconductivity further elaboration of such analysis for vector and axial has been made schafer and shuryak rilm happens to reproduce rather accurately the aleph data on decay for both vector and axial correlators a comparison between the correlators calculated in rilm and on the lattice chu et al have also found good agreement including the baryonic channels unreachable by usual nomenology studies of hadronic wave functions and even glueball correlation funcitonshas followed again with results very close to what lattice measurements had produced for a review see schafer and shuryak the mean eld approximation mfa the main assumption of the mean eld approach is that a particle interact with its many neighbors via their common mean eld rather than developing specic correlations with few of them more technically the multibody distributions are then approximated by ansatz made of a product of independent body whether this assumption is or is not applicable needs of course be studied on a case by case basis in this section we follow diakonov and petrov let us start with the partition function for a system of instantons in pure gauge theory z i di exp sint here n are the numbers of instantons and anti instantons i zi i ui are the collective coordinates of the instanton i is the semi classical instanton distribution function and sint is the bosonic instanton interaction so mfa assumes that the partition function is evaluated via a product of single instanton distributions di v i d the distribution is then determined from the variational where principle or maximization of the z log in quantum mechanics a variational wave functions always provides an upper bound on the true ground state energy the analogous statement in statistical mechanics is known as feynman s variational principle using convexity z exp s exp s in this respect this assumption is similar to boltzmann hypothesis behind his kinetic equation while true for gases it does not hold for stronger correlated systems such as liquids as we will see below it is not a good approximation for instanton liquid as well march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles where is the variational action one can see that the variational vacuum energy is always higher than the true one in our case the single instanton action is given by while s is the average action calculated from the variational distribution since the variational ansatz does not include any correlations only the average interaction enters for the sum ansatz nc n the same for both ia and ii pairs note that is of the same form as the hard core mentioned above with a dierent dimensionless parameter applying the variational principle one nds diakonov and petrov exp v n where is the average instanton action and is the average size we observe that the single instanton distribution is cut o at large sizes by the average instanton repulsion note also that the cuto has a gaussian dependence on the same as seen in lattice studies we mentioned above the average size is determined by the self consistency condition the result is v which determines the dimensionless diluteness of the ensemble v using the pure gauge beta function we get the diluteness v even more dilute than phenomenology requires the instanton density can be xed from the second self consistency requirement n v the factor comes from instantons and anti instantons one gets from above and p v n v top n v v p v r mev it is it may be consistent with the phenomenological values if p v instructive to calculate the free energy as a function of the instanton density using f log z one has v f n v log n the instanton density is determined by the minimizing the free energy v the vacuum energy density is given by the value of the free march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles energy at the minimum we nd n v as above and n v estimating the value of the gluon condensate in a dilute instanton gas v we see that is consistent with the trace anomaly the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the instanton density the compressibility of the instanton liquid is given by v b n v where is the equilibrium density this observable is also determined by a low energy theorem based on broken scale invariance b here the left hand side is given by an integral over the eld strength correlator subtracted suitably regularized and with the constant disconnected term for a dilute system of instantons the low energy theorem gives n n b n n is the average number of instantons in a volume v the result here shows that density uctuations in the instanton liquid are not poissonian using the general relation between uctuations and the compressibility gives the result this means that the form of the free energy near the minimum is determined by the renormalization properties of the theory therefore the functional form is more general than the mean eld approximation used to derive it how reliable are these results first of all it can not be better than the underlying interaction obtained from the particular set of gauge eld congurations later studies had shown that the sum ansatz used indeed is not a good representation of instanton antiinstanton ley which is not surprising since it was chosen without any justication other than simplicity the interaction based on streamline congurations found by baarschot can be used instead but the results also also not satisfactory because the ensemble contains too many close pairs and too many large tons stabilization of the density is reached by an exclusion of congurations with small action presumably already included in the perturbation theory with is a repulsive core weaker than in the sum ansatz but still present another issue is the accuracy of the mfa itself as the density decreases the binary correlations are building up which are ignored in the mfa its accuracy can be checked by doing statistical simulations of the full partition function march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles diquarks and color superconductivity the second most attractive channel is the interaction of two quarks in the scalar s channel it also follows from t hooft eective lagrangian and suppressed it was by a factor pointed out in two simultaneous alford et al rapp et al in the same interaction leads to a very robust cooper pairing in high density qcd in few years this eld have boomed and has now a bibliography of about papers but we will not discuss it here relative to the most attractive scalar qq channel the issue of diquarks may require some further discussion since there exists only one zero mode per instanton only diquarks with dif f erent avors can be formed ud us one well known argument for a nucleon like hadrons being made of diquark pair comes from regge trajectories as we will discuss in chapter on the ux tubes the slope of the nucleon regge trajectory is the same as for mesons this means there are two color objects connected by a single ux tube another interesting consequence is for a nucleon spin structure if it is made of scalar diquark and never uu then there is no way d quark contribute anything to the nucleon spin recent lattice works did indeed conrmed this d contributes half of u into the total momentum but withing decreasing errors nothing to spin instantons for larger number of colors recall that the one loop instanton action is given by where is the rst coecient of the beta function in pure gauge qcd in the t hooft limit nc with thoof t const we expect and it lead to argument by witten that instantons do not survive the large nc limit our discussion of nite t theory will show rather simple realization of that idea instantons will be indeed split to nc instanton dyons the action per dyon is thus nite in the t hooft limit however it was also shown that the iilm in fact also has a reasonable large nc limit although it is reached in a non trivial way we will discuss that now following a detailed study by schafer who managed to show that few known paradoxes of the dilute gas approximation do disappear in the interacting instanton liquid in fact a self consistent picture of the ensemble emerges which well agrees were submitted to the archive on the same day also fermi statistics requirement needs to be satised with total spin zero the spin wave function is anti symmetric color part is antisymmetric as well so avor should also be antisymmetric a product of three minuses is minus as fermi statistics requires march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles with the pre existing theoretical expectations including the witten conjectures about the topological susceptibility and the mass another remarkable feature of this regime is that the dierence with what we know about instanton ensemble in qcd is not really drastically changed even in the large nc limit in brief main features of this regime is as follows the density of instantons is predicted to grow as nc whereas the typical instanton size remains nite the eective diluteness accounting for the fact that instantons not overlapping in color do not interact remains constant interactions between instanton are important and suppress uctuations of the topological charge as a result the u anomaly is eectively restored even though the number of instantons increases using mean eld approximation and then numerical iilm simulations one nds that this nario does not require ne tuning but arises naturally if the instanton ensemble is stabilized by a classical repulsive core although the total instanton density is large but the instanton liquid remains eectively dilute because instantons are not strongly overlapping in color space since the total instanton density is related to the non perturbative gluon densate n v ga the nc counting suggests that and we are lead to the conclusion that n v this is also consistent with the expected scaling of the vacuum energy using equ and the trace anomaly relation ga the vacuum energy density is given by n v using n v we nd that the vacuum energy scales as agrees with our expectations for a system with n c gluonic degrees of freedom which note that n v implies that the eective diluteness of instantons remains constant in the large nc limit indeed in spite of large density most tons do not see each other the number of mutually commuting su subgroups of su nc scales as nc if instantons are distributed randomly then uctuations in the number of tons and anti instantons are expected to be poissonian this leads to the predictions n where n ni na is the total number of instantons and q ni n n n na is the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles topological charge equ implies that top v n v using n v we observe that top which is in contradiction to witten s conjecture top however as we shall see the interactions between instantons suppress the uctuations and invalidate equs we now include the fermion related dynamics and ask how the chiral condensate scales with nc using rst analytic mfa after averaging over the color orientation of the instanton the eective lagrangian is l l r l l r l r we observe from it that the explicit nc dependence is given by n this is again related to the fact that instantons are su objects quarks can only interact via instanton zero modes if they overlap with the color wave function of the instanton as a result the probability that two quarks with arbitrary color propagating in the background eld of an instanton interact is n the mfa gap equation for the spontaneously generated constituent quark mass is m gnc m m where m is the constituent mass and g is the eective coupling constant in equ the factor nc comes from doing the trace over the quark tor the coupling constant g scales as nc because the density of instantons is and the eective lagrangian contains an explicit factor n we conclude that the coecient in the gap equation is and that the dynamically generated quark mass is also this also implies that the quark condensate which involves an extra sum over color is the results in the mean eld approximation are summarized in the fig which shows that for nc the average instanton size is essentially constant while the instanton density grows linearly with nc this can also be veried by expanding v in powers of nc and one observes that independent of the details of the interaction the instanton density scales at most as a power not an exponential in nc another way to see why the instanton density scales as the number of colors is as follows the size distribution is regularized by the interaction between instantons for deniteness we will consider the case nf but the conclusions are of course independent of the number of avors march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles fig instanton size distribution for dierent numbers of colors left nc calculated using mean eld approximation right from numerical simulations with n instantons this means that there has to be a balance between the average single instanton if the average instanton action and the average interaction between instantons stot action satises we expect that n v and the fact that the average interaction between any two instantons satises we expect that the density grows as nc also using stot fig b shows the instanton size distribution for dierent numbers of colors we observe that the number of small instantons is strongly suppressed as nc we also note that there is but the average size stabilizes at a nite value the critical size for which the number of instantons does not change as nc the value of is easy to determine analytically we write with f a where the coecients a c are independent of nc in the large nc limit the critical value of is given by the zero of f we nd the existence of a critical instanton size for which is independent of nc was discussed by teper neuberger shuryak and indeed observed on the lattice lucini and teper fluctuations in the net instanton number are related to the second derivative of the free energy with respect to n this result is in agreement with a low energy theorem based on broken scale invariance based solely on the renormalization group equations the left hand side is given by an integral over the eld strength correlator suitably regularized subtracted for a dilute system of instantons and with the constant term equ reduces to equ the result shows that uctuations of the instanton ensemble are suppressed by nc this is agreement with general arguments showing that uctuations are suppressed in the large nc limit we also note that the result clearly shows that even if instantons are semi classical interactions between instantons are crucial in the large nc limit march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles fluctuation in the topological charge can be studied by adding a term to the partition function the mean square is just the average instanton number n which is identical to the result in the random instanton liquid and not in agreement with witten s hypothesis top however diakonov et al noticed that equ is a consequence of the fact that in the sum ansatz the average interaction between instantons of the same charge is identical to the average interaction between instantons of opposite charge in general there is no reason for this to be the case and more sophisticated instanton interactions do not have this feature if r denotes the ratio of the average interaction between instantons of opposite charge and instanton of the same charge r then sii n this result shows that for any value of r are suppressed as nc witten s hypothesis uctuations in the topological charge we also note that top in agreement with in schafer the instanton size distribution the topological susceptibility and the spectrum of the dirac operator for dierent numbers of colors have been determined in iilm numerically the instanton size distribution obtained shows that small instantons are strongly suppressed as the number of colors increases we observe a clear xed point in the size distribution at the simulations were carried out in the total topological charge qtop sector of the theory one can nevertheless determine the topological susceptibility by measuring the average the topological of the euclidean box top in a sub volume tibilities for nc agree well with the expectation based on poissonian statistics n v for nc however uctuations are signicantly suppressed and the topological susceptibility increases more slowly than the density of instantons consistent with a scenario in which top remains nite as nc the chiral condensate for mq and topological susceptibility are shown in fig we clearly see that is linear in nc while top approach a constant march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical mechanics of the instanton ensembles fig dependence of the chiral condensate the number of colors the instanton density n v was assumed to scale as n v dashed lines show ts of the form for and the topological susceptibility top on nc the and n v and nc for top n v top march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton ensembles march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter qcd correlation functions and topology generalities denitions and an overall picture before we embark on technical discussion of the correlation function let us rst summarize in the non technical terms some pictures of the vacuum and hadronic structure which result from what we learned about instantons in particularly we know that the qcd like theories with light quarks have spontaneously broken su nf chiral symmetry in terms of hadronic spectroscopy this phenomenon manifests itself in two ways i quarks obtain constituent quark masses m ii there exist multiplets of goldstone modes the pions m ev we have further learned that chiral symmetry breaking is induced by tion of the quark zero modes associated with nontrivial topology of the instantons in fig we sketch a picture of that the pions exist because light quark undergo events the instantons in pairs in terms of the path integral such correlated quark paths are interpreted as existence of some attraction between u and strong enough to cancel twice the constituent quark mass m and make it another manifestation of the of the correlated tunneling is in the ud di quark pair in two color qcd its strength is exactly the same as in the pion channel and thus this diquark and anti diquark are also goldstone modes in total for nf in the three color world we live in the ud di quark is not color neutral and thus is not a hadron but it exists as a correlated inside the in a talk t d lee was explaining t hooft interaction by saying that it is like cars go in parallel lanes in the tunnel like from queens to manhattan i happen to be there and said that it is more like the tunnel between england and france whoever was left handed become right handed and vice versal pauli principle works for zero modes so the third quark is prohibited from tunneling together with ud pair it needs to drive around rather than take a tunnel and so its constituent mass is not reduced march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology nucleons fig the pion left and the proton right depicted as a sequence of tunneling events the blue circle indicate mass insertions note ud diquarks inside the proton note that because of topological index theorem quark zero modes have specic chiralities therefore t hooft interaction has very specic chiral structure for example the picture above can not hold for vector or tensor mesons so the aim of this section is to elucidate using phenomenological or lattice correlation functions the role of the topology in the vacuum and hadronic structure in fact one could have done it even simpler without quarks and their zero modes in pure gauge theories indeed the topological solitons themselves being selfdual or antiselfdual are made of so to say chirally polarized gluonic elds scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs are strongly aected by tunneling events while other ones tensor ones are not correlation functions are the main tools used in studies of structure of the qcd vacuum they can be obtained in several ways first they can in many cases be duced phenomenologically using vast set of data accumulated in hadronic physics second they can be directly calculated ab initio using quantum eld theory ods such as lattice gauge theory or semiclassical methods signicant amount of work has also been done in order to understand their small distance behavior based on the operator product expansion ope the large distance limit can also be understood using eective hadronic approaches or various quark models of hadronic structure in this section we focus on available phenomenological tion about the correlation functions emphasizing the most important observations which are then compared with predictions of various theoretical approaches lattice numerical simulations the operator product expansion and interacting instantons approximation as a common denominator for our discussion we have chosen the point to point correlation functions in coordinate representations march wspc book trim size for in in allinone generalities we will discuss two types of the operators mesonic and baryonic ones iijj here the color indices are explicitly shown but they will be suppressed below as all color indices are properly contracted and all quark elds are taken at the same point these operators are manifestly gauge invariant the correlation function is the vacuum expectation value vev of the product of two or more of them at dierent points y since the vacuum is homogeneous it depends on the relative distance the tance is assumed to be space like we prefer to deal with virtual instead of real propagation of quarks or hadrons from one point to another so one deals with decaying instead of oscillating one can look at a pair of points arate by euclidean distance in terms of two distinct limits either they can be two dierent points in space taken at the same time moment or be two events at the same spatial point separated by non zero interval of the imaginary euclidean below we will use both depending on which is more convenient time at the moment due to lorentz invariance rotational in euclid the answers are of course the same small distances perturbative normalization of the tors qcd at small distances remember the other argument of the correlator we take at the origin the asymptotic freedom of qcd tells us that up to small and calculable radiative corrections quarks and gluons propagate freely kf where free quark correlator in mesonic baryonic case is essentially the square cube of the free massless quark propagator sf from the dimension of the free correlators they can only be for the mesonic of course qcd does have a baryonic channels kf x sional parameter qcd which shows up in physical non free correlators and cause deviations from kf however in the perturbation theory it only x at this point i was inevitably asked an old question how can be any correlation between the elds outside of the light cone it was essentially answered by feynman long ago who had to defend his propagator and prescription following from euclidean denitions in the path integral the particles can propagate along any path going from to y the correlations outside the light cone do not contradict causality because one can not use it for the signal transfer speaking small includes the zero distance and thus the reader should be aware that some correlators may have local terms proportional to its derivatives we will mostly ignore such terms not showing them in the plots unless the integral over is done march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology comes in via the radiative corrections therefore at small x those produce corrections to our estimates above containing powers of x if quarks are allowed to propagate to larger distances they start interacting with the non perturbative vacuum elds if corrections are not too large one can take these eects into account using the operator product expansion ope formalism at intermediate distances description of the correlation functions becomes in general very complicated and one may only evaluate them either using lattice numerical simulations or some vacuum models e the instanton ensembles we discuss now at large distances the behavior of the correlation functions is given using the time evolution of an operator iht where h is a hamiltonian and then insert a complete set of physical intermediate states between the two operators in minkowski time this means n iten now one can analytically continue the correlation function into the euclidean main it and get a sum over decreasing exponents exp physically application of such relation in qcd means that one considers propagation of physical excitations or hadrons between two euclidean points so mx at large where m is the mass of the lightest particle with the corresponding quantum numbers note that this is essentially the idea of yukawa who had related the range of the nuclear forces to the then hypothetical meson mass after we have recollected these general facts let us try to explain why the relation functions are so important in non perturbative qcd and hadronic physics the answer is it is the most eective way to study the inter quark eective action models of hadronic structure various bags skyrmions resemble the state of the nuclear physics in its early days when only limited information about the nuclear forces were known from properties of the simplest the bound states e the deuteron those are sucient to reproduce qualitative features of the action but it is the extensive studies of the nn scattering phases in all relevant channels at all relevant energies which had eventually revealed the details of nuclear forces with their complicated spin isospin structure quite similarly applications of quark models are mostly are averaged over few lowest states and the precise dependence of the inter quark interaction on distance and momenta remains unknown a conning potential with few additions like spin forces t the spectrum since due to connement the qq or the qq scattering is experimentally impossible a set of correlation functions per channel substitute for the the phase shifts in nuclear physics roughly speaking the correlator tells us about virtual qq or qq scattering using instead of physical hadrons the wave packets of a variable size march wspc book trim size for in in allinone generalities dispersion relations and sum rules if one makes a fourier transform of the resulting function depends on the momentum transfer q owing from one operator to another for clarity we use the following notations introducing momentum squared with negative sign so for virtual space like momenta we are interested in like in scattering experiments due to causality it satises standard dispersion relations ds s it where the r s contains the so called physical spectral density describes the squared matrix elements of the operator in question between the vacuum and all hadronic states with the invariant mass and certainly is zero only for positive s note that because we will only consider negative or the semi plane without singularities we never come across a vanishing denominator and therefore ignore which is usually put in denominator this simplications are possible because our discussion is restricted to virtual processes although in the r s we do use information coming from the real experiments of annihilation the dispersion relation can be a basis of the so called sum rules their general idea is as follows suppose one knows the l s in some region of the argument it means that some integral in the r s of the physical spectral density it can be used to relate a set of physical parameters unfortunately is known the so called nite energy sum rules using directly momentum space are not very productive most of the dispersion integrals are divergent leading to usable sum rules only after some subtractions which introduce extra parameters and undermine their prediction power for example we have mentioned above that at small mesonic correlators are the free quark propagator squared its fourier just given by kf ree form is log and the imaginary part of the log gives for the spectral s therefore putting it into dispersion relation density in the r s given above one nds an ultraviolet divergent a simple way to go around this is to consider the second derivative over of both sides of then one nds a convergent dispersion relation however while going back to the original function from its derivative one has to x the integration principle virtual processes contain all the information but of course in practice it is much more dicult to go in the opposite direction and reproduce the physical spectral density from the correlators considered signal that in the last argument something is missing in this particular example it is clear what is it the constant under the log is lost that polynomials in s generate local terms in we ignore assuming that is never zero march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology fig two diagrams for mesonic correlators in a some gluonic background indicated by the dashed circle the avored currents have only the single loop diagram while the unavored currents have also the two loop contributions of the type b we will use the coordinate space by applying fourier transformation to one obtains the following nearly self explanatory form shuryak the former function describe the amplitude of production of all intermediate states of mass s while the latter function ds is nothing else but the euclidean propagation amplitude of this states to the distance the dierence between this expression and borel sum rules is not really very mx therefore one also has an signicant at large the propagator goes as exp s the space time exponential cuto only exp one can be calculated numerically on the lattice or in instanton liquid and also analytic formulae are simpler to derive sx substitutes the exp for completeness let me also mention one more type of the correlation function the one traditionally used in lgt this is the so called plane to plane correlation function obtained from by an integration over the dimensional plane kplane to in other terms spatial integration makes the momentum of intermediate states to be zero so dispersion relation are done in energy only this function respectively can be related to physical spectral density by kplane to m dm flavor and chirality ow combinations of correlators let us now follow the quark avor ow in the correlators the lavored and unf lavored currents have dierent types of quark diagrams as shown in fig the former ones have only the one loop contributions a while the latter have the two loop diagrams as well for example we will discuss the avored march wspc book trim size for in in allinone generalities channels like which have operators of the type ud where is the propriate dirac matrix since two quark lines are in this case of dierent avor u and respectively obviously one can not have a double loop on the other hand considering similar unavored channels like one has the uu dd ss terms which can be looped thus if one would be interested in a dif erence between say and channels that would be entirely due to the two loop diagram b furthermore one can be interested in the so called non diagonal correlators for example with a dierent avors such as again one is restricted to the two loop diagrams only the main focus of lattice work deals with the one loop diagrams and therefore with the avored channels the reason is technical to which we would not go into it is often instructive to use specic combination of correlation functions which focus on the phenomena we would like to study in particular one would like to understand how breaking of the su nf and u manifest themselves in the correlation functions let me give two examples of such choices the rst a of the vector and ple is the following linear combinations v axial correlation functions all eects of the interaction in which quark chirality is preserved throughout the loop cancels out because two produced furthermore v a is non zero only due to the eects of chiral symmetry breaking this can be most clearly expressed if one writes the two currents in terms of left qrqr then this combination includes the and right handed currents as qlql chirality ip twice a v v a therefore in the chiral limit is obviously zero to any order of the perturbation theory the charged component of it one loop diagram the second example is a similar dierence but between the scalar called or and the the pion rn an s f an s non where and are pseudo scalar and scalar ns two point correlators lated to the currents and if the gation is chosen along the euclidean time direction an s represents q q pair with iso spin to be found after a time the probability amplitude for a interval in a state in which the chirality of the quark and anti quark is changed not interchanged notice that the ratio rn must vanish as no chirality ips and must approach as innitely many chirality ips again this amplitude receives no leading perturbative contributions the ence with the example is that this ratio is proportional to the chirality structure rl rl r l same as for the t hooft vertex while in the example it was ll rr march wspc book trim

symmetry is broken through a vector coupling like in present dse approaches unlike the former combination the latter one is growing surprisingly rapidly already at small distances m see fig from the lattice study faccioli and degrand the reason is that this correlator admits a direct instanton induced t hooft vertex while the v a does not two instanton liquid ensembles used are the random one rilm which has no fermionic determinant and the interacting iilm in which it is included note that in rilm the chirality ip ratio rises rapidly and exceed while the unquenched iilm follows the unitarity requirement rn the result of quenched lattice calculation shown in fig follow very accurately the same overshooting of as the rilm results the unquenched lattice ones are not yet available at the other hand the naive constituent quark models which only include chirality ips due to constituent quark mass show very slow rise shown by the lowest curve in the fig general inequalities between the one quark loop correlators for correlators given by one quark loop diagrams there exist some important general inequalities between them in order to derive those following weingarten uses

word about chiral symmetry breaking and goldstone theorem here the result is more general note also that at large the scalar correlator must be much much smaller than the pseudoscalar one since the dierent lowest masses are in the exponent it means that there must be a very delicate cancellation between dierent components of the quark propagator in all channels except the pseudoscalar one in

for their ensembles vector and axial correlators we start the discussion of the correlation functions with the vector and axial rents these currents really exist in nature as the electromagnetic ones coupled to photons and the parts of the weak current coupled to w z bosons therefore we know a lot about such correlators in fact quite complete spectral densities have been experimentally measured in

there appear the corresponding coecients in the expression for the electromagnetic current the reader may wonder how the experimental selection of the channels is actually made it is clear enough for heavy avors c and if the nal state has a pair of such quarks there are much more chances that they were directly produced in the electromagnetic current than that these are produced by strong nal state interaction below we use this idea for the strange quark as well although some corrections should in principle be applied in this case it is also possible to separate light quark channels they have a dierent isospin which is conserved by any strong nal state interaction as it is well known c parity plus isotopic invariance leads to the so called g parity conservation and pions have negative parity therefore strong interactions do not mix states with even and odd number of pions the currents j j have xed g parity as well and therefore pionic states created by them can have only even or

the vector correlation functions in euclidean space time as we are interested in quark interactions it is convenient to plot all correlators normalized to free motion of a massless quarks ree

consists of two quite ferent parts i at s gev the prominent meson resonances which all have very distinguishable decay channels and kk respectively sured but not shown in the plot and primed resonances of which only is indicated on the plot decaying mainly into the pion channel the distinction between the lowest resonances and the primed one can be seen from a striking fact that the contribution of the latter s are in good agreement with the horizontal curves with and without perturbative corrections adding the next ones seen in the pion channel creates a rather smooth non resonance continuum corresponding to perturbative quark propagation as seen form this plot this happens at energies s gev it is not shown on this plot but still true that this in fact happen not just in the sum but in each channel individually march wspc book trim size for in in allinone vector and axial correlators fig the ratio of r mass of the hadronic system s in gev versus the total invariant using parametrizations of the data in each channel and the dispersion relation one can calculates the euclidean correlation function the resulting curve is shown in fig note that starting with rather complicated spectral densities containing high peaks and low dips one arrives at a very smooth function of the distance clearly the way back from the euclidean space to the physical spectral density would be next to impossible task quite striking observation made in shuryak which is specic to tor currents only as we will see later in this section is that the resonance and continuum contributions complement each other very accurately as a result the ratio remains close to one up to the distances as large as fm while each functions falls by orders of magnitude this ne tuning was called in shuryak a superduality let me explain why this is indeed a remarkable and so far unexplained fact at small distances it is very natural to expect the so called hadron parton duality between the sum over hadronic states and the pqcd quark based tion basically it is a simple consequence of the asymptotic freedom up to about gev m in the interval m the correlator itself drops by more than orders of magnitude while its ratio to the free loop free quark tion remains close to within percents what this remarkable phenomenon means is that in this channel all kind of interactions perturbative instanton and connement related ones cancel out in wide range of distances omitting the details of how other correlators has been extracted from nomenology let us show in fig how all vector correlators and also the axial one look like as a function of euclidean distance and normalized at small distances as explained above comparing them one can see that in spite of completely ent widths of the resonances and dierent decay states even or odd pion numbers march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology fig all vector correlators together plus the axial correlator for comparison all four vector correlators look remarkably similar the main dierence between them is the strange quark mass which systematically suppress the correlators at larger distance this demonstrates deep consistency between independent sets of data which is rather impressive to complete our discussion of the vector channels let us comment on the the dierence between the and correlators what induces it smallness is in particular due to the following facts rho omega mass dierence is only mev the omega phi mixing angle is only degrees those were the basis of the so called zweig rule forbidding the avor changing transitions let us look at the transition correlator itself the former current dd uu dd thus the dierence between them is the uu while the latter is changing correlator k which can only come from the two loop diagram the reason for such strong pression of is that in vector channels there are no direct instanton contribution in the rst order in t hooft interaction and the eects of the second order tend to cancel march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the pseudoscalar correlators the pseudoscalar correlators now we move to the pseudoscalar su octet k channels and the su singlet where we see a completely dierent picture their denitions are j jk j i i fig preceding gures it is now shown with the logarithmic scale the correlation functions for the pseudoscalar nonet note that in contrast to the again omitting the details of the phenomenological inputs the resulting k pseudoscalar correlators are shown in fig note huge dierence pared to the vector correlators considered above instead of changes within in the interval of distances fm considered for pseudoscalars the ratio k kf ree has changed by up to two orders of magnitude one reason for that behavior is of course small masses of the pseudoscalar mesons in terms of the qq interaction this implies a very strong attraction note also that up to distances of the order of fm there is no marked dierence between the three curves which means that all eects proportional to the strange quark mass are irrelevant in this region march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology what is really surprising is that the asymptotic freedom is violated at very small distances about fm and that this happens due to the contributions of the lowest mesons themselves this fact noticed rst by novikov et al novikov et al shows that the pseudoscalar channels dier substantially from vector and axial ones already at very small distances the singlet meson can be associated with tho important operators one is the singlet axial current mentioned above and another is the gluonic pseudoscalar g g the relation between matrix elements of these operators is given by ing between vacuum and the state of the famous adler bell jackiw anomaly relation we discussed in chapter j g g where the contributions proportional to the light quark masses are ignored omitting details we comment that the latter matrix elements can be extracted from charmonium decay with the g gev g g g gev gev to complete discussion of this section let us now do some preliminary mates of the contribution of three states to pseudoscalar gluonic correlator as in all other channels at small distances the correlator is dominated by perturbative asymptotically free gluonic contribution which is equal to g kf it is thus instructive to ask a simple question at what the contribution of together to become equal to kf ree the answer is at m m for all vector resonances and keep in a very short distance compared to mind that we still have not seen the contribution of the true pseudoscalar glueball yet expected to dominate the s the main conclusion one can draw from this discussion is that the boundary between pqcd and non perturbative physics are very much channel dependent they go to larger momenta smaller distances in pseudoscalar channels and are even higher smaller distances in the spin zero gluonic channels all of this point to the topological solitons and their zero modes the subject of the next subsection may wander why they grow rather decrease with the mass the reason is the pseudoscalar gev and the closer are to glueball state is expected to be in the range it the larger is its admixture march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the rst order in the t hooft eective vertex the rst order in the t hooft eective vertex we have seen in section that the zero modes of the dirac operator in the for avored currents instanton eld play a special role in the chiral limit mq the single loop diagram in which only the zero mode parts of both propagators is used leads to expression of the type y n mumd where for the time being nf and we ignore the strange quark entirely n is the instanton density and the matrix is the gamma matrix in the vertex now recall that for the instanton background eld the quark zero mode is r for the handed while the antiquark one is left handed only it is ipped l anti instanton this leads to the following general conclusions such contribution in the vector or the axial channels when is zero since these currents are nonzero only if both spinors have the same chirality for scalar and channels is non zero and have the opposite sign same for avored current one can see that the pseudoscalar gets positive relative correction while the scalar or gets a negative one analogous calculation for avor singlet scalar or and pseudoscalar we would still call gets split as well with the former getting positive and the latter negative contribution the absolute magnitude of these corrections for all cases considered is the so all the signs are in perfect agreement with phenomenology which as cussed in the previous chapter does indeed suggest light and heavy now as we are satised that signs are correct what about the absolute nitude of these corrections the product of small quark masses appear in the denominator which however can be tamed in a single instanton background its density n also has the product of these masses due to the fermion determinant however a consistent evaluation of any eect can not proceed without account for broken chiral symmetry in the qcd vacuum and condensates in the single instanton approximation sia discussed in chapter in place of the bare quark masses one should substitute properly dened eective masses in the rst paper on the subject shuryak it was done more crudely in the mfa for k correlators let us return to a single instanton background and proceed to the vector channel we have shown above that the zero mode term does not contribute in this case so md in the fermionic the correlator is actually nite in the chiral limit without mu that we put i into the current in order to keep the zeroth order free quark loop the same in both cases march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology determinant the calculation itself was done by andrei and gross andrei and gross and this paper created at the time signicant controversy non vanishing contributions come from the non zero mode propagator and from the interference between the zero mode part and the mass correction the latter term survives even in the chiral limit because the factor m in the mass correction is canceled by the m from the zero mode ag y tr after averaging over the instanton coordinates the result sia d log where we get the reason we discuss this result is its relations to the ope expanding sia this agrees exactly with the ope expression provided we use the average values of the operators in the dilute gas approximation d qq m d note that the value of m is anomalously large in the dilute gas limit this means that the contribution from dimension operators is attractive in tion with the ope prediction based on the canonical values of the condensates qq correlators in the instanton ensemble in this section we generalize the results of the last section to the more general case of an ensemble consisting of many pseudo particles the quark propagator in an arbitrary gauge eld can always be expanded as s where the individual terms have an obvious interpretation as arising from multiple gluon exchanges with the background eld if the gauge eld is a sum of instanton is a mistake by an overall factor in the original work originated from color traces in other words the result is correct in march wspc book trim size for in in allinone correlators in the instanton ensemble contributions a i ai then becomes s i i j j si si sj j sj si sk j j k here i j k refers to both instantons and anti instantons in the second line we have re summed the contributions corresponding to an individual instanton si refers to the sum of zero and non zero mode components at large distance from the center of the instanton si approaches the free propagator thus eq has a nice physical interpretation quarks propagate by jumping from one instanton to the other if i for all i the free propagator dominates at large distance terms involving more and more instantons become important zi zi i y in the qcd ground state chiral symmetry is broken the presence of a sate implies that quarks can propagate over large distances therefore we can not expect that truncating the series will provide a useful approximation to the propagator at low momenta furthermore we know that spontaneous symmetry breaking is related to small eigenvalues of the dirac operator a good is dominated by mation to the propagator is obtained

follows paring the re summed propagator with the single instanton propagator ij arises from the restriction i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology shows the importance of chiral symmetry breaking while is proportional to m the diagonal part of the full propagator is proportional to t m the result can also be derived by inverting the dirac operator in the basis spanned by the zero modes of the individual instantons y y i i i m j j j the equivalence of and is easily seen using the fact that in the sum ansatz the derivative in the overlap matrix element tij can be replaced by a covariant derivative the propagator can be calculated either numerically or using the mean eld approximation we will discuss the mean eld propagator in the following section for our numerical calculations we have improved the zero mode propagator by adding the contributions from non zero modes to rst order in the expansion the result is y y szm sn zm i y y how accurate is this propagator we have seen that the propagator agrees with the general ope result at short distance we also know that it accounts for chiral symmetry breaking and spontaneous mass generation at large distances in addition to that we have performed a number of checks on the correlation functions that are sensitive to the degree to which satises the equations of motion for example by testing whether the vector correlator is transverse the vector current is conserved mesonic correlators in the following we will therefore discuss results from numerical calculations of hadronic correlators in the instanton liquid these calculations go beyond the rpa in two ways i the propagator includes genuine many instanton eects and non zero mode contributions the ensemble is determined using the full fermionic and bosonic weight function so it includes correlations among instantons in addition to that we will also consider baryonic correlators and three point functions that are dicult to handle in the rpa we will discuss correlation function in three dierent ensembles the random ensemble rilm the quenched qilm and fully interacting iilm instanton ensembles in the random model the underlying ensemble is the same as in the mean eld approximation only the propagator is more sophisticated in the quenched approximation the ensemble includes correlations due to the bosonic action while the fully interacting ensemble also includes correlations induced by the fermion determinant in order to check the dependence of the results on the instanton interaction we study correlation functions in two dierent unquenched ensembles march wspc book trim size for in in allinone correlators in the instanton ensemble fig rho meson correlation functions the dashed squares show

one based on the streamline interaction with a short range core and one based on the ratio ansatz interaction the bulk parameters of these ensembles are compared in tab correlation functions in the dierent instanton ensembles were calculated in shuryak and verbaarschot schafer et al schafer and shuryak ans unq mean fieldlattice march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology to which we refer the reader for more details the results are shown in fig and summarized in tab the pion correlation functions in the dierent ensembles are qualitatively very similar the dierences are mostly due to dierent values of the quark condensate and the physical quark mass in the dierent ensembles using the gell mann oaks renner relation one can extrapolate the pion mass to the physical value of the quark masses see tab the results are consistent with the experimental value in the streamline ensemble both quenched and unquenched but clearly too small in the ratio ansatz ensemble this is a reection of the fact that the ratio ansatz ensemble is not suciently dilute in fig we also show the results in the channel the meson correlator is not aected by instanton zero modes to rst order in the instanton density the results in the dierent ensembles are fairly similar to each other and all fall somewhat short of the phenomenological result at intermediate distances fm we have determined the meson mass and coupling constant from a t the results are given in tab the meson mass is somewhat too heavy in the random and quenched ensembles but in good agreement with the experimental value m mev in the unquenched ensemble since there are no interactions in the meson channel to rst order in the instanton density it is important to study whether the instanton liquid provides any signicant binding in the instanton model there is no connement and m is close to the two constituent quark threshold in qcd the meson is also not a true bound state but a resonance in the continuum in order to determine whether the continuum contribution in the instanton liquid is predominantly from or quark states would require the determination of the corresponding three point functions which has not been done yet instead we have compared the full correlation function with the non interacting mean eld correlator where we use the average constituent quark propagator determined in the same ensemble see fig this comparison provides a measure of the strength of interaction we observe that there is an attractive interaction generated in the interacting liquid due to correlated instanton anti instanton pairs this is consistent with the fact that the interaction is considerably smaller in the random ensemble in the random model the strength of the interaction grows as the ensemble becomes more dense however the interaction in the full ensemble is signicantly larger than in the random model at the same diluteness therefore most of the interaction is due to dynamically generated pairs we have already discussed aleph data and have shown the data pared to ope and the calculation in the random instanton liquid model rilm by schafer and myself schafer and shuryak another gure from this work fig shown here shows larger part of the correlator studied as one can see rilm works for the whole v a curve and with radiative correction s it works very well for v a as well there is no t of any parameter here and in fact the calculation preceded the experiment by few years march wspc book trim size for in in allinone

correlation functions reconstructed from the aleph spectral functions and the dotted lines show the corresponding error band the squares show the result of a random instanton liquid model and the diamonds the ope t described in the text the situation is drastically dierent in the channel among the lation functions calculated in the random ensemble only the and the scalar discussed in the next section are completely unacceptable the correlation function decreases very rapidly and becomes negative at fm this ior is incompatible with the positivity of the spectral function the interaction in the random ensemble is too repulsive and the model over explains the u anomaly the results in the unquenched ensembles closed and open points signicantly improve the situation this is related to dynamical correlations between instantons and anti instantons topological charge screening the single instanton tion is repulsive but the contribution from pairs is attractive only if correlations among instantons and anti instantons are suciently strong the correlators are prevented from becoming negative quantitatively the and ns masses in the ensemble are still too heavy as compared to their experimental values in the ratio ansatz on the other hand the correlation functions even shows an hancement at distances on the order of fm and the tted masses is too light this shows that the channel is very sensitive to the strength of correlations among instantons in summary pion properties are mostly sensitive to global properties of the instanton ensemble in particular its diluteness good phenomenology demands as originally suggested in shuryak the properties of the meson are essentially independent of the diluteness but show sensitivity to ia correlations these correlations become crucial in the channel let us add about dependence of the correlators on the number of colors nc march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology table meson

was adjusted such that n v in order to avoid nite volume artifacts the current quark mass was taken to be rather large mq we observe that the rho meson correlation function exhibits almost perfect scaling with nc and as a result the rho meson mass is practically independent of nc the scaling is not as good in the case of the pion as a consequence there is some variation in the pion mass however this eect is consistent with nc corrections that amount to about of the pion mass for nc finally we study the behavior of the correlation function there is a clear tendency toward u restoration but the correlation function is still very repulsive for nc it was also found that the correlation function only approaches the pion correlation for fairly large values of nc for example the correlation function does not show intermediate range attraction unless nc after discussing the in some detail we only briey comment on other relation functions the remaining scalar states are the isoscalar and the isovector the and according to the notation of the particle data group the sigma at large correlator has a disconnected contribution which is proportional to distance in order to determine the lowest resonance in this channel the constant contribution has to be subtracted which makes it dicult to obtain reliable sults nevertheless we nd that the instanton liquid favors a presumably broad resonance around mev the isovector channel is in many ways similar to the in the random ensemble the interaction is too repulsive and the correlator becomes unphysical this problem is solved in the interacting ensemble but the is still very heavy m gev the remaining non strange vectors are the and the mixes with the pion which allows a determination of the pion decay constant f as does a direct march wspc book trim size for in in allinone correlators in the instanton ensemble mixing correlator in the instanton liquid disconnected measurement of the contributions in the vector channels are small this is consistent with the fact that the and the as well as the and the are almost degenerate finally we can also include strange quarks su avor breaking in the t hooft interaction nicely accounts for the masses of the k and the more dicult is a correct description of mixing which can only be achieved in the full ensemble the random ensemble also has a problem with the mass splittings among the vectors k and shuryak and verbaarschot this is related to the fact that avor symmetry breaking in the random ensemble is so strong that the strange and non strange constituent quark masses are almost degenerate this problem is improved but not fully solved in the interacting ensemble baryonic correlation functions as emphasized few times above the existence of a strongly attractive interaction in the pseudo scalar quark anti quark pion channel also implies an attractive action in the scalar quark quark diquark channel this interaction is logically very desirable because it not only explains why the spin nucleon is lighter than the spin delta but also why lambda is lighter than sigma the vector components of the diagonal correlators receive perturbative loop contributions which are dominant at short distance the scalar components of the diagonal correlators as well as the correlation functions are sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking and the ope starts at order or higher instantons introduce additional regular contributions in the scalar channel and violate the factorization assumption for the quark condensates similar to the pion case both of these eects increase the amount of attraction already seen in the ope qq the correlation function n in the interacting ensemble is shown in fig there is a signicant enhancement over the perturbative contribution which sponds to a tightly bound nucleon state with a large coupling constant numerically we mn gev see tab in the random ensemble we have sured the nucleon mass at smaller quark masses and found mn gev the nucleon mass is fairly insensitive to the instanton ensemble however the strength of the correlation function depends on the instanton ensemble this is reected by the value of the nucleon coupling constant which is smaller in the interacting model fig also shows the nucleon correlation function measured in a quenched lattice simulation chu et al the agreement with the instanton liquid results is quite impressive especially given the fact that before the lattice calculations were performed there was no phenomenological information on the value of the nucleon coupling constant and the behavior of the correlation function at intermediate and that this value corresponds to a relatively large current quark mass m mev march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology fig nucleon and delta correlation functions n and large distances the tted position of the threshold is gev larger than the mass of the rst nucleon resonance the roper n and above the threshold gev this might indicate that the coupling of the nucleon current to the roper resonance is small in the case of the continuum this can be checked directly using the phenomenologically known coupling constants the large value of the threshold energy also implies that there is little strength in the unphysical three quark continuum the fact that the nucleon is deeply bound can also be demonstrated by comparing the full nucleon correlation function with that of three non interacting quarks see fig the full correlator is signicantly larger than the non interacting mean eld result indicating the presence of a strong attractive interaction some of this attraction is due to the scalar diquark content of the nucleon current this raises the question whether the nucleon in our model is a strongly bound diquark very loosely coupled to a third quark in order to check this we have decomposed the nucleon correlation function into quark and diquark components using the mean eld approximation that means treating the nucleon as a qu mean field field fieldlattice march wspc book trim size for in in allinone correlators in the instanton ensemble table nucleon and delta parameters in the dierent instanton ensembles all quantities are given in units of gev the current quark mass is mu unquenched quenched rilm ratio ansatz unqu mn n n m interacting quark diquark system we get the correlation function labeled diq in fig we observe that the quark diquark model explains some of the attraction seen in n but falls short of the numerical results this means that while diquarks may play some role in making the nucleon bound there are substantial interactions in the quark diquark system another hint for the qualitative role of diquarks is provided by the values of the nucleon coupling constants n one can translate these results into the coupling constants s p n of nucleon currents built from scalar or pseudo scalar diquarks we nd that the coupling to the scalar diquark current s is an order of magnitude bigger than the coupling to the pseudo scalar current p this is in agreement with the idea that the scalar diquark channel is very attractive and that these congurations play an important role in the nucleon wave function the delta correlation function in the instanton liquid is shown in fig the result is qualitatively dierent from the nucleon channel the correlator at intermediate distance fm is signicantly smaller and close to perturbation theory this is in agreement with the results of the lattice calculation chu et al note that again this is a quenched result which should be compared to the predictions of the random instanton model the mass of the delta resonance is too large in the random model but closer to experiment in the unquenched ensemble note that similar to the nucleon part of this discrepancy is due to the value of the current mass nevertheless the mn mev still too nucleon mass splitting in the unquenched ensemble is m large as compared to the experimental value mev similar to the meson there is no interaction in the delta channel to rst order in the instanton density however if we compare the correlation function with the mean eld approximation based on the full propagator see fig we nd evidence for substantial attraction between the quarks again more detailed checks for example concerning the coupling to the n continuum are necessary march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology comparison to correlators on the lattice the study of hadronic point to point correlation functions on the lattice was oneered by the mit group chu et al which measured correlation functions of the n and in quenched qcd the correlation functions were culated on a lattice at corresponding to a lattice spacing of fm we have already shown some of the results of the mit group in a figs the correlators were measured for distances up to fm using the parametrization introduced above they extracted ground state masses and pling constants and found good agreement with phenomenological results what is even more important they found the full correlation functions to agree with the predictions of the instanton liquid even in channels like the nucleon and delta where no phenomenological information is available in order to check this result in more detail they also studied the behavior of the correlation functions under cooling chu et al the cooling procedure was monitored by studying a number of gluonic observables like the total action the topological charge and and the wilson loop from these observables the authors conclude that the congurations are dominated by interacting instantons after cooling sweeps instanton anti instanton pairs are continually lost during cooling sweeps the topological charge uctuations are consistent with a and after dilute gas the characteristics of the instanton liquid were already discussed above after sweeps the action is reduced by a factor while the string tension measured from wilson loops has dropped by a factor the rst comparison made between the instanton liquid results and those tained on the lattice chu et al are shown in fig for vector v and pseudoscalar p channels even more direct comparison was between the correlator calculated on the quantum congurations as compared to cooled or semiclassical lattice gurations chu et al the behavior of the pion and nucleon correlation functions under cooling is shown in fig the behavior of the and relators not shown was quite similar during the cooling process the scale was readjusted by keeping the nucleon mass gluonic correlation functions one of the most interesting problems in hadronic spectroscopy is whether one can identify glueballs bound states of pure glue among the spectrum of observed this introduces only a small uncertainty the change in scale is we observe that the correlation functions are stable under cooling they agree almost within error bars this is also seen from the extracted masses and coupling constants while mn and m are stable by denition m and g change by less than by and n by only the delta mass

energy theorem that controls the large distance behavior of the scalar correlation function novikov et al in order to make the where b denotes the rst coecient of the beta function as well integral well dened and we have to subtract the constant term as singular perturbative contributions to the correlation function analogously the integral over the pseudo scalar correlation functions is given by the topological p top in pure gauge theory top susceptibility while in unquenched qcd top these low energy theorems indicate the presence of rather large non perturbative corrections in the scalar glueball channels this can be seen as follows we can incorporate the low energy theorem into the sum rules by using a subtracted dispersion relation ds is a contact term in the scalar glueball correlators which depending on the choice of sum rule may enter momentum space correlation functions march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology table scalar glueball parameters in dierent instanton ensembles gev random quenched unquenched in this case the subtraction constant acts like a power correction in practice ever the subtraction constant totally dominates over ordinary power corrections is for example using pole dominance the scalar glueball coupling s completely determined by the subtraction s s b for this reason we expect instantons to give a large contribution to scalar ball correlation functions expanding the gluon operators around the classical elds we have y y y is the gluon propagator in the classical background eld ga cl dy dx where dab insert the classical eld of an instanton we nd gb cl ab if we sia s p y y with y there is no classical contribution in the tensor channel since the stress tensor in the self dual eld of an instanton is zero note that the perturbative contribution in the scalar and pseudo scalar channels have opposite sign while the classical contribution has the same sign to rst order in the instanton density we therefore nd the three scenarios discussed in sec attraction in the scalar channel repulsion in the pseudo scalar and no eect in the tensor channel the instanton prediction is compared with the ope in fig we clearly see that classical elds are much more important than power corrections quantum corrections to this result can be calculated from the second term in using the gluon propagator in the instanton eld the singular contributions correspond to the ope in the instanton eld there is an analog of the smilga result for glueball correlators in a general self dual background eld there are no power corrections to the tensor correlator this is consistent with the result since the combination vanishes in a self dual eld also the sum of the scalar and pseudo scalar glueball correlators does not receive any power corrections while the dierence does starting at numerical calculations of glueball correlators in dierent instanton ensembles were performed in schafer and shuryak at short distances the results are consistent with the single instanton approximation at larger distances the scalar march wspc book trim size for in in allinone wave functions correlator is modied due to the presence of the gluon condensate this means that like the meson the correlator has to be subtracted and the determination of the mass is dicult in the pure gauge theory we nd gev and while the mass is consistent with qcd sum rule predictions the coupling is much larger than expected from naive calculations that do not enforce the low energy theorem in the pseudo scalar channel the correlator is very repulsive and there is no clear indication of a glueball state in the full theory with quarks the correlator is modied due to topological charge screening the non perturbative correction changes sign and a light on the glueball mass scale state the appears perturbative corrections in the tensor channel are very small isolated instantons and anti instantons have a vanishing energy momentum tensor so the result is entirely due to interactions in schafer and shuryak we also evaluated the glueball wave functions the most important result is that the scalar glueball is indeed small fm while the tensor is much bigger fm the size of the scalar is determined by the size of an instanton whereas in the case of the tensor the scale is set by the average distance between instantons this number is comparable to the connement scale so the tensor wave function is probably not very reliable on the other hand the scalar is much smaller than the connement scale so the wave function of the glueball may provide an important indication for the importance of instantons in pure gauge theory wave functions one quantity which is close to hadronic wave function is the so called bethe salpeter amplitude which is dierent from the so called light cone one such bethe salpeter amplitudes have been measured in a number of lattice gauge simulations in the pion case this quantity is dened by ei y in practice it is extracted from the three point correlator y t ei y mx where has to be a large space like separation in order to ensure that the tion function is dominated by the ground state and y is the separation of the two quarks in the transverse direction y in practice it is convenient to divide the point by point function canceling the dependent part and the coupling constants march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd correlation functions and topology fig hadronic wave functions of the pion rho meson proton and delta resonance in the random instanton ensemble like the two point correlation functions the bethe salpeter amplitudes are culated from the light quark a qualitative understanding of the wave functions can be obtained using the single instanton approximation for for small transverse separations y and we get a very simple result indicated that a pion radius as determined by bethe salpeter amplitude is directly related to the instanton radius the wave functions in the random ensemble was calculated by schafer and shuryak those for n and are shown in g we observe that the pion and the proton as well as the rho meson and the delta resonance have very similar wave functions but the sizes for pion and the proton are smaller than the rho meson and the delta resonance we have already argued that the scalar diquark in the nucleon is linked with the instanton induced attraction in general the inclusion of the schwinger pexp factor is expected to give an important tion to the measured wave functions since it corresponds to an additional string

hadrons started in s with two theoretical breakthroughs both related with the corresponding symmetries one was related to properties of strange partners of better known particles k partners to pions k to mesons to nucleons it lead gell mann and neeman to the so called eightfold way their classication via the octet tation of the avor su group three avors were of course u d s quarks and spectra were well described via su expression perturbed by symmetry breaking mass terms this approach culminated by prediction of the baryon decuplet another representation of su group with subsequent imental discoveries of all its members completed by the sss baryon needless to say with the discovery of c and then b quarks nonrelativistic description of corresponding hadrons followed the description of masses were complemented by similar description of other properties such as baryon magnetic moments note that dirac particle has netic moment proportional to magneton unit e m inversely proportional to mass baryon magnetic moments suggested that quarks have mass about of the nucleon mass quark models of hadrons indeed use such constituent quark masses another insight into hadronic and quark properties was proposed even a bit earlier in in nambu and jona lasinio this model called njl pointed out the notion of chiral symmetry and its spontaneously breaking the authors postulated existence of fermion interaction with some coupling g strong enough to make a superconductor like gap even in vacuum at the surface of the dirac sea the second and the last parameter of the njl model was the cuto gev below which their hypothetical attractive fermion interaction operates although there are many quark of dierent degree of sophistication this chapter we will not discuss glueballs we however will discuss them in later chapters in march wspc book trim size for in in allinone light front wave functions of hadrons and instanton induced eects their common elements are i the constituent quark masses ii interquark potential including conning linear tials iii and various residual interactions mostly of fermion type the method of choice like in atomic and nuclear physics is selection of certain large basis of the wave functions representing the hamiltonian as a matrix in it with its subsequent diagonalization r and coulomb r while the constituent quark masses constitute most of the hadronic masses the potentials ii contribute typically of them and the residual interactions are very important only in some exceptional hadrons such as mesons the eld of hadronic spectroscopy was for a long time reduced to mesons qq and baryons qqq states while larger systems such as pentaquarks q and dibaryons predicted by such models were never seen only with inclusion of heavy quarks pentaquarks were relatively recently discovered completing this introductory section let me also mention the qcd cousins obviously there are two directions in which nc with the number of colors nc can be changed up and down and both are rather interesting if nc the baryons containing nc quarks need to become very heavy skyrme s view on baryons as classical solitons made of mesonic elds become justied in this limit this direction we will further discuss in chapter on holographic models one can also reduce nc from to considering two color qcd due to specic properties of the su group two index quarks and antiquarks are not really dierent and it has additional pauli gursay symmetry relating them this symmetry has multiplets in which mesons and baryons enter together in particular with u quarks the chiral symmetry breaking leads to massless goldstone modes pions diquark ud and its antiparticle one may wander how parameters of quark models depend on nc and whether extrapolation from nc to the real world with nc would be possible it was pointed out rapp et al in connection to color superconductivity that residual forces the coulomb and instanton induced ones scale as vqq vqq nc

known as dokshitzer gribov lipatov altarelli parisi dglap evolution equation it includes certain splitting functions describing probablity of a ton splitting into two also important to note as any other single body boltzmann equation dglap is based on implicit assumption that higher correlations between bodies are small and can be neglected let me only comment here that pdfs are by their nature single parton servables in a many parton system dglap has the form of a kinetic equation and surprisingly recently kharzeev and levin noticed that as for any netic equation one can introduce the notion of entropy its inclrease with time with eventual approach of its maximum the equilibrium state entropy is property of the single parton density matrix but the hadrons selves are of course pure

dierent n e baryons have the simplest sector with n and then n as extra quark pairs can be completing this introductory section let me mention several physics phenomena we will be discuss below in the chapter perhaps the most famous of them is the so called spin crisis related to the question how the total spin of the proton of course equal to is shared between dierent kinds of partons i would prefer to reformulate this puzzling issue into several what is the contribution of the valence d quark to the spin what is the contributions of the sea of the dierent avors of quarks and antiquarks why is the sea of the polarized proton polarized at all iv why is the sea polarized in the isospin that this feature is not new or exclusive to hadrons atomic and nuclear states are also described as closed shells plus some number of quasiparticles plus any number of hole pairs excited by the residual part of the hamiltonian march wspc book trim size for in in allinone light front wave functions of hadrons and instanton induced eects quark models on the light front mesons in the qq sector let me start with the general kinematics and normalization condition of the light front wave functions they are dened in momentum representation with xi being the integration measure momentum fractions along the beam direction which denes the orthogonality condition in the sector with i n partons is dened as dxi ixi xi mn i i i note that apart of two delta functions expressing momentum conservation there is also a product of all momentum fractions introduced for convenience the so called asimptotic wave funciton corresponds in this normalization is independent of xi note also that states in sectors with dierent n are assumed to be orthogonal to each other by denition the simplest case is the body sector of the mesons in this case the restriction on momentum fraction becomes just and therefore the wave function is a function of a single longitudinal variable it is convenient to select the asymmetry variable s dened via the inverse relations expressing momentum fractions via it are s s s the basic setting we will follow is due to jia and vary the hamiltonian has four terms including i the eective quark masses coming from chiral metry breaking the longitudinal connement the transverse motion and connement and last but not least iv the njl quark eective interaction h hm h h conf hn jl hm m m h m m h conf where m m are masses of quark and antiquark is the conning parameter and are transverse momenta the integration measure is march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quark models on the light front baryons as qqq states and coordinates if the masses are the same no strange quarks however one can simplify it and therefore the matrix element of hm simply lack the factor present in the integration measure the value of their parameters are normally mq gev gev in ref jia and vary the basis is designed so that the part of hamiltonian other than hn jl is diagonal in subsequent paper shuryak this requirement is dropped and the basis is simply given by jacobi polynomials p n s other simplications include dropping transverse momentum dependence and using only topology induced t hooft fermion operator therefore it is absent in the meson and enter in eective hamiltonian for and with the opposite signs we already seen it in the chapter on correlation functions the results are shown in fig note that the predicted pdf for mesons is just the wave function squared there are no extra variables to integrate the quark momentum distribution for meson in which the fermion interaction is presumed to be absent is peaked near the symmetric point s the pion one in contrast has a completely dierent at shape the pdf is deviating to the opposite direction getting even more concentrated in as one compares the lower plot to our result one should keep in mind the fact that the pdf include also contribution from sectors with the quark number larger than while ours so far do not quark models on the light front baryons as qqq states the quark wave functions we will be discussing are dened as for delta baryon and for the proton p and in what follows we will focus on the former component in which the quark has the last momentum fraction for a review see braun that it is probability in momentum representation the coordinate one does the opposite

missing this is cancelled by factor coming from a dierence between derivatives in and s t variables the third and the last eect we incorporate in this work is the induced quark interactions note that topological t hooft lagrangian is avor antisymmetric this means that it does not operate e in baryons made of the same avor quarks like the uuu another reason why the t hooft vertex should be absent is in any states in which all chiralities of quarks are the same like lll for both these reasons is not aected by topology eects therefore serving as a benchmark like the meson did in the previous sections for discussion of the masses see the original paper the main results are the pdf and the wave functions the distribution in momentum of the d quark is obtained by integration over s t n s t and it is shown in fig for delta and nucleon wave functions we tained two comments i the peak in the nucleon distribution moves to lower xd as compared to expected in and non interacting three quarks there appears larger tail toward small xd in the nucleon but also some peaks at large xd both are unmistakably the result of local ud pairing strong rescattering in a diquark cluster the fig lower shown for comparison includes the empirical valence distribution also shown by red solid line the location of the peak i roughly corresponds to data and the presence of small xd tail is also well seen recall that what is plotted is distribution times the experimental distribution is of course much smoother than ours it is expected feature our wave function gev while is expected to be below the pqcd eects at resolution say the lower plot is at gev ant it includes certain amount of pqcd gluon radiation contains higher order correlations between quarks in order to reveal the structure one can of course compare the wave functions without any integrations as they depend on two variables s t only such plots of t we show in fig for the delta the nucleon and some model discussed in chernyak et al

peaking corresponds to large momentum transfer inside the ud diquark clusters yet there is also the peak in the middle roughly corresponding to that in delta so the nucleon wave function is a certain coherent mixture of a three quark and diquark components which is t fig the probability distribution t in s t variables for the delta and nucleon lowest states as calculated from the model additional

nucleon channels note rst that the largest coecients are the rst t furthermore for the delta it is close to sponding to trivial t for the nucleon the fraction of signicant coecients one while it is only is much larger for n the nucleon wave function has a nontrivial tail toward higher n harmonics which does not show any decreasing trend one may in fact clude that convergence of the harmonic expansion is not there this can be traced to apparent peak near perhaps the pointlike residual interaction leads to true singularity there two lower plots of fig address the distribution of the wave function cients c n in these two channels without and with the residual quark interaction it includes not the ground state but the lowest states in each channel as it is clear from these plot in the former delta case the distribution is very gaussian with majority of coecients being small the latter nucleon case on the other hand is in agreement with gaussian in other quantum systems atoms and nuclei gaussian distribution of the wave function coecients c n is ally taken as a manifestation of quantum chaos in this language we conclude that our model calculation shows that the residual quark interaction leads to chaotic motion of quarks at least inside the nucleon resonances if this conclusion surprises the reader we remind that the same interaction was shown to produce chaotic quark condensate in vacuum in particular numerical studies of ing instanton liquid in vacuum has lead to chiral random matrix theory of the vacuum dirac eigenstates near zero accurately conrmed by lattice

that application of some model hamiltonians to light front wave functions of hadrons should have been done long time ago yet it is just starting with the model presented in this paper still being deliberately rather schematic but at least including constituent quark masses connement and some residual interactions due to gauge topology we have shown that local fermion residual interaction does indeed modify meson and baryon wave in a very substantial way in jia and vary it was shown that the and meson have very dierent wave functions we now show that it is also true for baryons the proton and the have qualitatively dierent wave functions the imprint left by strong diquark ud correlations on the light front wave functions is now established we furthermore found evidences that nucleon resonances show features of quantum chaos in quark motion we also seen the rst steps toward the un quenching the light front wave functions estimating multiple matrix elements of the mixings between q and q baryon pentaquark components of the nucleon wave function this puts mysterious spin and avor asymmetries of the nucleon sea inside the domain of consistent hamiltonian calculations march wspc

monopoles their magnetic eld lines do not go radially but in circle see fig three colors red blue and green on the picture depict not the number of colors which is two but three adjoint elds due to three generators of su as the picture suggests each eld type rotates around a dierent axis fig qualitative distinction between the magnetic eld in monopole and spalerons historically existence of such solution have been suggested by dashen et al as an extended soliton for the young mills higgs equations of motion in the electroweak sector of the standard model weinberg salam theory as a soliton alternative to the thooft polyakov monopole in georgi glashow model a decade later klinkhamer and manton km have looked for an explicit solution ationally and numerically in note added in proofs as all other non perturbative solitons the eld is g and the mass times the relevant scale the electroweak coupling is small and the mass of the km sphaleron solution turned monopolesphaleron march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path out to be as large mkm t ev the fact that only numerical solution was found is related to the fact that it is not represented by any simple spherically symmetric shape as it gets deformed by a specic direction taken by the higgs eld in broken electroweak vacuum with nonzero higgs vev indeed one of the components z boson does not have the same mass as the other two w which makes it elliptic for early review consult e mclerran it has been subsequently found that while this conguration solves the equation of motion it is unstable unlike other solitons discussed so far uctons and instantons which are minima of the action the sphalerons are saddle points in a space of all congurations while for uctons the quadratic operator of the uctuations had only positive modes and for instantons positive and zero modes for sphalerons one or more negative mode appears in the spectrum thus their name sphaleron which according to its discoverers means in greek ready to fall in this chapter we will not follow these original papers first of all our main focus will be on qcd applications where complications related with higgs and its vev are absent even in section devoted to electroweak sphalerons and cal baryogenesis it would be sucient to much simpler analytic solution found later for pure gauge sector ostrovsky et al and known as the cos sphaleron the way toward it was historically related to the instanton antiinstanton rations which we need to consider rst instanton antiinstanton interaction and the streamline set of congurations in the chapter devoted to interacting instanton ensembles we skipped the discussion of the instanton antiinstanton interaction which we will discuss now interaction returning to the double well potential let us start with a simple sum ansatz g i a t t where t this path has the action it is qualitatively clear that if the two instantons are separated by a large time it is smaller than current s of lhc one may ask whether one can expect its production there unfortunately even if one would build collider with much higher energy available there are no chances to produce this object experimentally due to vanishingly small overlap with two colliding proton state between instantons does not exist at the classical level as is clear from the relation between the action and the topological charge march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton antiinstanton interaction and the streamline set of congurations the action is close to in the opposite limit t the interval t instanton and the antiinstanton annihilate and the action should tend to zero in that limit however the ia pair is at best an approximate solution of the classical equations of motion and it is not clear how the path should be chosen the best way to deal with this problem is the streamline method and yung to dene them one starts with an extremum of the action in this case innitely separated ia pair and lets the system evolve with the gradient ow to smaller action the force is dened as f and the streamline equation is sliding along the direction of the force dt here t is extra sliding time not to be confused with the euclidean time on which all paths depend at zero t there are well separated instanton and antiinstanton at t they annihilate each other to a trivial path a set of such paths for the double well instantons were obtained numerically in my paper shuryak for the gauge theory instantons one can start with the simplest sum ansatz g aa ay i i i ay i i i where for simplicity we selected the same radii and orientation of both solitons note however that while for a single instanton the pure gauge singularity at the origin cancels in the expression for the elds it does not do so for the sum ansatz this can be cured in the following ratio ansatz g aa ay i i ay i i i i in search for better approximation verbaarschot using conformal invariance of classical yang mills equation mapped this problem into a co central instanton and antiinstanton with dierent radii this introduced a notion that the action dependence on the d distance between the

word of explanation of notations here all vectors without an indicative index are matrices obtained by their contraction with the vector r an overbar similarly denotes contraction with for example r note that barred and unbarred matrices always alternate in all terms this is because one index of each matrix is dotted and the other not in spinor notation the additional coordinate with tilde is the u here stands for relative orientation color matrix parameterized by u r is its projection to unit relative distance vector for same orientation of and u the instanton and antiinstanton u this expression represents a very good approximation to the streamline equation not only at large distances zi as claimed by yung in the original paper but also at all distances as well in fact at distance zero the formula produces a very complicated eld a which however after inspection was found to be a pure gauge with zero eld strength i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone from the instanton antiinstanton congurations to the sphaleron path the interaction for this ansatz verbaarschot is sia u u r r u u u where is related to the conformal distance parameter dened above large distance r is large zero distance at is fig the instanton and antiinstanton are placed at euclidean time axes the sphaleron path congurations are located at the middle plane t and t along the from the instanton antiinstanton congurations to the sphaleron path in the previous section we dened some set of congurations describing an instanton and an antiinstanton placed at a certain euclidean time positions t and t see fig using those we will deduce some special set of congurations possessing only magnetic elds indeed the instanton elds are self dual while the antiinstanton ones are anti selfdual by symmetry at the d plane in between the electric eld must vanish therefore at this d plane the eld is purely magnetic furthermore these congurations make a one dimensional set parameterized by the time distance t between the instanton and the anti instanton for each of those one can dene their energy normalized by size er b b march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path and the chern simons number it has been calculated by ostrovsky et al for the streamline yung ansatz and shown in fig note that at ncs corresponding to large distance t the energy is zero and it is also tend to zero at ncs the maximum is in the middle at ncs when the instanton and anti instanton half overlap these congurations constitute the so called sphaleron path leading from one classical vacuum to the next r versus chern simons number ncs for the d fig the energy times the r m radius e congurations obtained from the instanton antiinstanton yung ansatz as described in the text the curve should be compared to the sphaleron path we soon obtain from constrained minimization let us now look at this problem from a dierent point of view in the gauge the electric eld is given by the time derivative of am therefore the electric eld has a meaning of momenta conjugated to coordinates am and term in energy interpreted as eld kinetic energy pure magnetic eld congurations with zero electric eld have thus only the potential energy one can view those as some turning points at which momentum is zero indeed such points connect the tunneling part of the path at e v with the real time evolution at e v in fact the action on the plane can be viewed as given the probability rather than the amplitude of such forced tunneling with a vertical line in the fig literally interpreted as the unitarity cut describing the eld state ready to propagate into the minkowski time the sphaleron path from a constrained minimization by sphaleron path we mean a one parameter set of congurations interpolating between the nearest values of chern simons number e from ncs to ncs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the sphaleron path from a constrained minimization because of symmetry of the barrier we are trying to calculate it is expected that the maximum the sphaleron corresponds to ncs naively what needs to be done is to x ncs to some value and then nd among such congurations the one with minimal possible energy this is indeed what was v ew is dened by the done in electroweak theory the expected mass scale is higgs vev v t ev and the electroweak coupling constant we however mentioned above that in all application we will discuss the higgs vev or even existence of the higgs elds itself will not be important the problems we want to address are dominated by the gauge elds thus it is natural to ask whether one can identify sphaleron path in pure gauge theory unlike electroweak theory classical pure gauge theory is scale invariant it has no dimensional parameters naively this would imply that all minima are at zero value because one can always reduce the energy by rescaling the size of the conguration upward to break this unwanted scale symmetry one need to set an additional requirement basically xing the size of the soliton in question it can e be dened as r m s radius b b if it is xed there will be a particular static solution with the minimal energy we are looking for the product of the energy times r m s size is dimensionless and that will be what we will evaluate below we will follow in this section the work by ostrovsky carter and myself ostrovsky et al and will nd the shape of the barrier since we are interested in static congurations those would be purely made up of magnetic elds since the electric elds have negative t and thus not allowed as a starting simplifying assumption we will consider a spherically metric d conguration of the gauge eld indeed often the eld congurations with the minimal energy have the maximal possible symmetry of course we pect the energy density and not the gauge elds themselves be spherically symmetric for the color subgroup in which we are interested congurations of the a can be expressed through the following four space time j a gauge eld and color a structures j j a a xa a t r a j j with three mutually orthogonal projectors a j r a j aj xaxj a j xaxj march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path while for the sphaleron path problem the four functions should be static pendent on time t the attentive reader would notice that we included the time the reason for it is that later on we will also discuss a dynamical problem of the sphaleron explosion one may rewrite a problem with r and dependent functions as some dimensional lagrangian in fact this is true for the problem at hand and our four functions of eq can be rewritten as four elds of the abelian gauge higgs model on a hyperboloid a sin r cos r b c d one can express the eld strengths in these terms as r r a j e g a sin cos j cos j sin j and a j b a r cos sin sin cos j j r a j r putting those expression into the usual where sional minkowski action and integrating over angles one nd reduced action t and s drdt a j b a j e with the summation now over the dimensional indices the t r space is with the metric note that and now have a meaning of the modulus and phase of some charged scalar the charge is abelian as seen from the last term containing the eld strength squared what exactly does this elegant re writing of the lagrangian in new elds give us well it helps to understand better the remaining symmetries of the model the spherical ansatz is preserved by a set of gauge transformations generated by march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the sphaleron path from a constrained minimization unitary matrices of the type u r t exp i t axa these transformations naturally coincide with the gauge symmetry of the sponding abelian higgs model a this freedom can be used to gauge out for example one component of a we will use the gauge from now on before proceeding any further let us express the topological current k a a a g b a a a a g in the reduces form in the gauge k k i xi cos cos while the topological charge becomes k note that only gauge invariant combinations of eld derivatives appear here as a topological coordinate marking the tunneling paths and the turning states one can use the chern simons number ncs cos the rst gauge invariant term is sometimes called the corrected or true simons number ncs while the second gauge dependent term is referred to as the winding number it is the change in ncs which is equivalent to the integral over the local topological charge now we are done with the digression of re writing spherically symmetric problem into a form and return to the static sphaleron path to keep both the chern symons number and the mean radius constant we introduce two lagrange march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path multipliers and search for the minimum of the following functional e dr it is convenient to introduce new variable then e where the euler lagrange equations are finiteness of the energy demands the following boundary conditions the second eq gives with integration constant equals as it follows from the form of energy after substitution to the eq one has the solution to this equation exists for assuming to be positive one nds nally it is estat ncs for any mean radius of the solution

the potential see fig the same prole obviously continues from to and so on as a periodic potential with zeros at all integer values of ncs as a chain of mountains separated by valleys in fact there are mountains of any hight but tall ones are narrow if energy is expressed in units of g it becomes unique note that the maximum is about parabolic but near zero energy the behavior is linear so valleys are actually more like a deep canyons the maximum is the sphaleron solution corresponding to and ncs let me nish this technical part with qualitative description of the solution remember that states of the sphaleron path are static balls of purely magnetic eld unlike the monopole in which case the eld is radial now the magnetic eld rotates around in circles three color components of the eld recall we are in and there are three generators rotate around axes repesctively the total sum squared is spherically symmetric summarizing they are neat magnetic bombs ready to explode march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path sphaleron explosion as we already mentioned above the sphalerons are saddle point solution which are unstable add a small perturbation to a ball placed on the top of the mountain pass and will start rolling down into one or the other valley the same paper ostrovsky et al came up with an analytic solution for this problem as well the static sphaleron eld conguration found in previous section is used as the initial condition for real time minkowski evolution of the gauge eld let us rst consider the equations of motion in the dimensional dynamical system variation of the action eq gives a the solution of eq has the form where t is an arbitrary smooth function eqs are consistent with this solution if now combining eq and eqs one has which can be viewed as a necessary and sucient condition for to be a solution for eq and eqs simultaneously eq is now the initial conditions for eqs and are t t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron explosion where the t independent elds on the right sides of the equations are the static solutions of and from the previous section as with static solutions it is more convenient to discuss the time evolution equations in hyperbolic coordinates let us choose and such that cos t sin cos sin cos sin and is covered by for t the corresponding domain is this change of variables is a conformal one the physical domain of r and and in the new variables eqs and become limit corresponds to the line before solving these equations let us note that it is possible to predict the t behavior of gauge eld from the form of the conformal transformation on the plane indeed the t the if one now takes the limit t position on plane is either this means that the entire line corresponds to space time points with nite dierences between r and t and therefore if and are smooth functions of and then for asymptotic times the eld is concentrated near the r t line this corresponds to the elds expanding as a thin shell in space regardless of the limit for or r t we must now supply eqs with initial conditions which are sin one of the solutions of eqs rst found in by luscher and schechter is with a function that satises q march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path this is the equation for a one dimensional particle moving in double well potential of the form u q we now have to check that the solution satises the initial conditions this is indeed the case if one identies and takes for the initial for energy u q the solution of condition of this type i e eq is qdn k where dn is jacobi s function and q particle in the potential u q we have also dened is the second stopping point for a and q t where t the period of oscillations in the potential u q is t with being the complete elliptic integral of the rst kind the idea is of course that oscillations in begin from the rest point close to let us now look at several properties of the solution for large times the solution is apparently regular in the plane and therefore for large times the eld is concentrated near r at asymptotic times the energy density t is given by t r the change in topological charge is q k drdt t r k k arccos the evolution of ncs begins from time t where and as t q we now estimate number of gluons produced by the described evolution in its limit is ncs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron explosion language the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic elds are ea j t sin r r r cos a j r sin t cos a

ba j are the color space projectors in momentum space analogous to and is a bessel function m as is required for a radiation eld j completing this section let us mention that alternative derivation of the solution for the sphaleron explosion has been found by zahed and myself shuryak and zahed it starts with euclidean d symmetric ansatz gaa af y f y march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path with and the t hooft symbol upon substitution of the gauge elds in the gauge lagrangian one nds that the eective lagrangian has the form corresponding to the motion of a particle in a double well potential the conformal transformation in question has the form l d f y y with a while the original solution depends only on the radial ordinate in dimensions in terms of x this symmetry is broken and there is separate dependence on and the dimensional radius r the last step in getting the nal solution is the analytic continuation to minkowski time t via it it has the explicit form gaa t gaa t which includes i but still is manifestly real expressions for the gauge elds can be easily generated from it the only comment worth making is about the original parameter in terms of these minkowskian coordinates which we still call x has the form which is pure imaginary to avoid carrying the extra i we use the real log log t t e im arctan and in what follows we will drop the sux e switching from imaginary to real corresponds to switching from the euclidean to minkowski spacetime solution it changes the sign of the acceleration in equation of motion or equivalently the sign of the eective potential vm ve to that of the normal double well problem the static sphaleron solution corresponds to the particle standing on the potential maximum at f and the needed sphaleron decay to tumbling paths since the start from exactly the maximum takes a divergent time we will start nearby the turning point march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral anomaly and sphaleron decay fig the energy solid lines and chern simons number densities dashed lines for three times during the explosion t and fm the electric and magnetic elds squared chiral anomaly and sphaleron decay we had already discuss the relation between the and topological charges the divergence of the current containing chern simons number is equal to the topological charge k ga ga qt ga we used gauss theorem connecting the volume integral of the r s the ical charge to the change of the topological charge the chern simons number q t t t e b march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path the r s of this relation also appears in another important relation known in qcd like theories as adler bell jackiw abj or axial anomaly including divergence of the axial quark current it was historically obtained from triangular diagrams with one axial and two vector currents its derivation we will not discuss yet the physics related to it we will discuss in next chapters since the r s of both equations is the same topological charge their change in appropriate units is the same say one instanton q produces change in axial density na the classical minima with dierent chern simons number are associated with dierent axial charge the dierence between them is gauge invariant and given by q another combination of two currents is in fact conserved but not gauge invariant integrating the zeroth component of the currents over space one nds that in qcd with nf light quarks ncs qcd therefore the chern simons number of the gauge eld conguration is rigidly locked to the axial charge the number of left minus right polarized fermions for example if nf a transition over the sphaleron barrier from ncs to ncs must be accompanied by units of the axial charge let me out this into a small story so you better remember it there was a sea side hotel called the dirac sea hotel it was so big that we think of it extending indenitely both above the ground and below it has a bit strange policy to put occupants at as low level as possible and to mark which of the occupants are right and left handed which were put in two separate towers see the left gure a strange earthquake happened one day leading to the shift as indicated in the right gure all lefties went down by one oor and all righties one up see fig the same anomaly relation in electroweak theory leads to even more drastic consequences since only the left polarized quarks and leptons interact with the electroweak gauge eld there are no right hand elds in the equation furthermore there is no distinction between vector and axial current as only left handed part matters therefore the number rather than just chiralities of quarks and leptons are changed in electroweak theory a travel from ncs to ncs must lead to simultaneous production of quarks and leptons if the polarization of the sphaleron eld is up these fermions are trtbtgcrcbcgurubug e where r red blue g green are three colors of the quarks the baryon and lepton march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral anomaly and sphaleron decay fig occupancy of the dirac sea hotel before and after the earthquake numbers increase by units and their dierence is zero b l electroweak part of the sm can those drastic statement be put to experimental tests as far as the electroweak theory is concern the chances to do so are not there in the higgs broken vacuum we live today one has to go over the barrier with the hight t ev and the energy is not the main problem one needs to produce mkm w bosons t all of them in a small volume of an electroweak scale keeping all of them in a form of coherent congurations of the sphaleron path electroweak sphaleron transitions may however happen above and near the electroweak phase transition because in this case higgs vev is absent or small in qcd sphalerons have energy of only several gev so one might think those are well studied experimentally unfortunately this is not the case it still remains to be done one proposal shuryak and zahed to do that in hadron hadron collisions is via double diractive production of hadronic clusters with strong right quark asymmetry say units of the axial charge these clusters should resemble hadronic channels which we discussed in connection to c decays in heavy ion collisions one expect multiple sphaleron processes at the initial stage of the collision leading to reballs with a disbalanced chirality observation of this can be done with the help of chiral magnetic eect cme to be discussed at the end of this chapter while we have shown that general adler bell jackiw abj anomaly relation require locking of the chern simons number to the axial charge of the fermions it has not yet been explained how exactly it happens in fact one can follow this phenomenon using the exploding sphaleron solution derived previously let us start at time t from the static but unstable sphaleron dirac equation in the eld of the sphaleron has a fermionic zero mode like we previously discussed it for the monopole it should be i interpreted as a zero energy bound llllrrrrbeforelllrrrrrafter march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path state of a massless fermion which can be occupied or empty sphaleron explosion solution includes some radial electric elds at intermediate time only at the late time it is transverse this eld can accelerate a fermion from the initial zero energy state to some excited state with positive energy thus a qualitative picture of fermion production does not mean their produciton from nowhere but includes level motion out of occupied levels in the dirac sea to physical states with positive energy what about antifermions in order to have the same zero mode or other solution as fermions one needs the same form of the dirac equation with the same colormagnetic moment since the charge of antifermion is opposite to that of the fermion one has to ip the spin to compensate in qcd there is no problem with that just chirality of the produced positive energy antiquark would be opposite to that of the quark as a result one has production of a particle hole pair the baryon charge is not changed but the axial one the dierence between left and right fermions is changed by two units in electroweak theory there is a problem only left handed fermions interact while right handed do not as a result there is no antifermion solution mirroring the fermion one and the sole fermion is produced both axial and baryon or lepton charge is changed this reasoning is simple and consistent with what one expects from the anomaly so there is no doubts in its validity however attempts to follow dynamically the outlined scenario had encounter the following problem physical fermions are either produced or not so change in the axial or total charge can only be an integer the change of the chern simons number during the sphaleron explosion is expected to be and complemented by a similar process of sphaleron formation it is expacted to give also an integer however the rst numerical solutions of the km electroweak sphaleron explosion revealed a trouble the chern simons number apparently refused to settle at the expected change of it looked like a ball rlling down from the saddle point of the potential does not rall all the way to the valley s bottom it was rst taken as numerical problem but the same feature was conrmed in subsequent numerical solutions moreover it is there in the cos analytic solution presented above the not quite the chern simons number stabilizes at late times is ncs completed transition in terms of ncs is consequence of the classical approximation in which the gauge boson mass is neglected fortunately the analytic solution to the dirac equation in the background of the exploding sphaleron was found in shuryak and zahed the solution to the massless dirac equation in the minkowski background eld of exploding sphalerons can also be obtained by the same conformal mapping from the euclidean zero modes we explicitly construct these states and show that at the initial minkowski time those are zero energy states while at asymptotically march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral anomaly and sphaleron decay fig the spectrum of r quarks released at the sphaleron point versus its momentum in units of large time they reduce to a free quark or free antiquark of specic chirality we also calculate the spectrum of the produced fermions the solution itself is obtained by the following inversion formula y dirac equation in the euclidean spherically symmetric and it solves the gauge conguration omitting the technical details let us proceed to the results the quark trum is close to planckian with an eective temperature t the distribution integrates exactly to one produced fermion of each kind in electroweak theory with also antiquarks in qcd as the anomaly relation requires march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the topological landscape and the sphaleron path march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis introduction to cosmological baryogenesis the observed baryonic asymmetry of the universe bau is usually expressed as the ratio of the baryon density to that of the photons this key parameter enters calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis of such nuclei as d t all of them agree that its value is nb n the question how it was produced is among the most dicult open questions of physics and cosmology sakharov had formulated three famous necessary conditions for its generation i the baryon number violation ii the cp violation iii deviations from thermal equilibrium although all of them are formally satised by the standard model sm and standard big bang cosmology we do not yet know a specic mechanisms ing the baryon asymmetry smooth crossover electroweak transition does not erate large deviations from thermal equilibrium the baryon number violation is suppressed by huge sphaleron barrier and cp violation via ckm quark mixing matrix is quite small it is therefore widely accepted that bau is due to some so far hypothetical mechanisms e heavy neutrino decays or large cp violation in higgs sector for review of the eld see e dine and kusenko this common view is from time to time challenged by some suggested scenarios one of them we will discuss later in the chapter in the electroweak theory semiclassical description of the tunneling through the barrier separating topologically distinct gauge elds is given by the by now much discussed instanton solution however unlike in qcd the coupling is weak the action large and the tunneling probability in the broken phase we live in is extremely march wspc book trim size for in in allinone low sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs tunneling t exp what about thermal excitation of electroweak sphalerons in electroweak theory t ev the coupling is small thus the sphaleron energy large is e naive comparison with the highest temperature at which the broken phase exists t ev give boltzmann factor namely the electroweak critical temperature tew is not as small as the probability of tunneling just mentioned but it is still very small however close to tew the higgs vev is small and the sphaleron rate should not be suppressed that much we will return to this issue shortly v w however this estimate is too naive as the parameters of the electroweak theory are strongly renormalized near tc the main reason of the increase of the rate from the km sphaleron to revised one is of course the reduction of the higgs vev from its vacuum value v gev to near zero more accurate calculation of the equilibrium sphalerons rates at the electroweak cross over region give much larger rates for an update see e burnier et al who estimated those in the range t including rather large preexponent calculated semiclassically in refs arnold and mclerran carson et al moore such rates are however still too small for the solution of the baryogenesis puzzle on the other hand in the symmetric phase at t tc in which there is no higgs vev the sphaleron size can be much larger than the electroweak scale gev with respectively much higher sphaleron rates there is a limit to tc set by the inverse magnetic screening mass wt and the dimensional arguments thus put the sphaleron transition rate to more complicated analysis of the problem arnold et al shows that it is suppressed by one more power so mmag t tv wt although there appears a rather high power of weak coupling the exponential suppression is gone and so in the symmetric phase the sphaleron rates obtained are larger than the expansion rate of the universe at the corresponding era this means appearance of another problem all asymmetries which may be primordially generated would then be wiped out above the electroweak critical temperature these consideration force us to search for resolution of the baryon asymmetry puzzle at narrow temperature interval at or right below the electroweak phase transition march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis but before we return to recent works on electroweak sphalerons let us briey describe the history of cosmological electroweak transition electroweak phase transition originally this transition was assumed to be st order in which the broken phase in which higgs eld obtains a nonzero vev rst appear in form of bubbles their coalescence and excistence of bubble walls moving in the process have created hopes in s for large local deviations from thermal equilibrium however further studies of the transition have shown that the st order sition can only happen if the higgs mass is relatively small less than gev or so after cern discovery of higgs particle with a mass of gev it became obvious that sm ony predicts relatively smooth crossover transition after this has fact has been acknowledged people either looked at various phenomena beyond the sm such as its supersymmetric extensions which may still allow the order transitions we will also briey discuss the so called cold or hybrid scenario in which electroweak transition starts right after ination with strong deviation from equilibrium let us however return to standard cosmology and sm framework the best donofrio value of electroweak transition today is calculated on the lattice e et al produce the following value the temperature of the universe today is tnow k the ensuing redshift factor is tew gev during the radiation dominated era the relation of time to temperature is given by friedmann relation zew tew tnow t mp t gev the transition temperature and the inserting the planck mass mp eective number of degrees of freedom ndof we nd the time after the big bang to be tew ctew mm thus universe was really tiny then the rate of thermal sphaleron transitions both semiclassically and on the lattice especially in the symmetric phase see klinkhamer and manton arnold and march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs mclerran carson et al moore the main fact is that the sphaleron rate before the transition at t tew is suppressed by ew or about orders of magnitude and yet it is still many orders of magnitude higher than the expansion rate of the universe the hubble constant at the time so large sphaleron rate creates a problem of potentially washing out any bau created before the electroweak transition looking at it in more positive way there appears a possibility to transfer some lepton number asymmetry into bau since sphalerons produce quarks and leptons in xed combination recent lattice studies gave us better data on the sphaleron rate we will discuss it a bit later and now just note that there is a specic moment known as sphaleron freezeout when this rate is equal to the universe expansion rate from et al we know that it corresponds to temperature tf o gev the corresponding cosmological time is then tf o o quite amusingly these numbers nearly exactly time larger than critical and m ev and hadronic freezeout temperatures in heavy ion collisions tc out tf o m ev depending on the collision energy mm sphaleron size distribution at this point let us interrupt the discussion of cp violation and discuss whether large size and small momentum scale elds can indeed be found in cosmological setting of electroweak phase transition the details can be found in our original paper kharzeev et al let me just show the result in fig in short at t tew as shown by solid line the sphaleron tend to be rather large size on a scale of electroweak magnetic screening length but as the temperature shifts below tew and nonzero higgs vev appears their sizes rapidly shrink as shown by the colored points the mass of the sphaleron grows as with it the boltzmann factor exp m t rapidly falls gev the rate goes smaller than the universe expansion rate till at t tf o the horizontal dashed line and sphelarons become unimportant the hybrid cold cosmological model and sphalerons a scenario which we will discuss would then be the so called hybrid cold ical scenario in which the end of ination coincides with the electroweak transition so that equilibration happens at t tc this ensures large deviations from librium while based on some ne tuning of the unknown physics of the ination it avoids many pitfalls of the standard cosmology such as erasure of asymmetries generated before the electroweak scale the baryon number violation in it is due to the sphaleron transitions occur march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis fig the sphaleron suppression rates as a function of the sphaleron size in the solid curve corresponds to the unbroken phase v at t tew four sets of points top to bottom are for well broken phase at t gev they are calculated via ansatz b described in appendix c and normalized to lattice based rates the horizontal dashed line indicates the hubble expansion rate relative to these rates inside the bubbles of certain size and those can be studied numerically and semiclassically in detail the cp violation is not yet calculated accurately but its magnitude near the sphalerons will be estimated in such a scenario there are coherent oscillations of the gauge scalar elds in real time lattice simulations garcia bellido et al studied in detail tranberg and smit the simulated models include two scalars the inaton and the higgs boson and the electroweak gauge elds of the sm in the tion that the weinberg angle is zero z is degenerate with w all fermions of the sm are ignored the eect of the top quark in particular is the subject of the present paper after ination ends all bosonic elds are engaged in damped oscillations for relatively short time at the end of which the higgs vev and gauge elds stabilize gev well below to their equilibrium values with the bulk temperature tbulk the critical crossover temperature one important nding of the simulations is that the initial coherent lations of scalars soon give way to the usual broken phase the most important feature is persistence of no higgs spots in which higgs vev is very far from the equilibrium value v and is instead close to zero the gauge elds in them have however rather high magnitude fig from garcia bellido et al show an example of a snapshot of the higgs eld modulus typically the volume tion occupied by such no higgs spots is of the order of several percents and is march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs color online the contour plots from garcia bellido et al of the modulus of fig upper plot and the topological charge density t at time mt for the higgs eld the model ns red dark areas in the upper plot correspond to small vev while yellow light bulk corresponds to the broken phase on the lower plot lumps of the topological charge density appear as red regions dark in black and white display while most of the no higgs spots do not have the topological transitions all transitions seem to be inside the spots decreasing with time the second important ndings is that of topologically nontrivial uctuations of the gauge elds as shown in the lower fig those are well localized only inside the no higgs spots mentioned above indeed this becomes apparent from the distribution of the topological charge shown in the lower part of fig for the same time conguration of the higgs as shown in the upper part of the fig of course it is only one snapshot but the authors found from the simulations that it is true for the whole sample the fraction of hot spots no higgs vev which induced topological tions is also in the range of few percent more precise measure is the so called sphaleron rate is dened by the mean square deviation from zero of the simons number dn dt cs here and below all quantities are dened via one characteristic mass parameter m for the simulations its value is about gev close to v since the process only exist for nite period of time too early there are no gauge elds and too late there are no no higgs spots its time integral is well converging its value t ti march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis is in the range i for more details about dierent parameters sets see table ii of garcia bellido et al this quantity as well as of course snapshots like those shown in fig directly give the spatial distance between the topological uctuations rsphm fig charge at times mt and color online from garcia bellido et al two snapshots of the topological space time evolution of the topological charge q is shown in fig as two snapshots one can see that the uctuation at some time moment is very much concentrated in a small spherical cluster the upper one in fig is followed by an expanding spherical shell the lower one in fig which gets near empty inside the decomposition into electric and magnetic components of the eld shows with the that the uctuations starts as nearly magnetic object at mt peaking some time later then electric eld and thus the topological charge there appears an expanding shell followed by the magnetic eld rebounding to its secondary maximum of smaller amplitude we will return to discussion of all those features in the next chapter before discussing these numerical results let us point out an important issue which are discussed in flambaum and shuryak but are outside our current interest the no higgs spots seen in numerical simulations can be identied with the non topological solitons of the electroweak theory known as the wz top bags crichigno et al what we will consider now is the role of the quarks especially the top quarks in baryogenesis due to high cost of inclusion of the fermions those up to now were not included in lattice numerical simulations now we turn to the next question how much the sphaleron rate can be aected march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs by their presence as compared to purely bosonic ones in the simulations bellido et al the adler bell jackiw anomaly require fermions to be produced particular fermions depend on orientation of the gauge elds in the electroweak since in we are interested in utilization of top quarks we will assume it to be up such case the produced set contains trtbtgcrcbcgurubug e where r g are quark reaction of course in matter with a colors we refer to it below as the n are allowed nonzero fermion density many more reactions of the type n with n captured from the initial state evaluating the back reaction of the fermions on gauge eld the analytic lution to the dirac eqn of the expansion stage shuryak and zahed we discussed above is very useful a new element we are adding now is that its reection can also describe the compression stage from free fermions captured by a convergent spherical wave of gauge eld at t and ending at the sphaleron zero mode at t the details will be omitted but the main result is that by eating the top quarks already present in he bags one eectively lower the barrier and thus reach further increase of the sphaleron rate eective lagrangian for cp violation the only source of cp violation in the standard model is that induced by the phase of the of the cabbibo kobayashi maskawa ckm quark mixing matrix cp violation originally discovered in decays of neutral k mesons is now studied mostly by lhcb cern experiment at lhc in b meson decays it is a very large and involved eld into which we have no time to go still we need some brief introduction here let me start with qed and remind that th order electron box diagram generates eective lagrangian l originally calculated by heisenberg in euler in s similarly one can imagine some background electroweak elds w z and eective lagrangians generated by quark loop on general ground the cp odd eects require at least ckm matrices so the eect may in principle appear starting from the th order quark box diagram so one may think that the calculation of cp violating eective lagrangian is just an exercise most likely done half century ago when electroweak theory was found i am sorry to tell that it is rather involved calculation and the answer remains unknown to me even now for some reason plenty of eld theorists who do diagrams of all possible kind in all possible theories failed to solve this important issue according to one explicit calculations of the eective cp odd lagrangian nandez et al in the leading w order there is no cp violation and we sill soon check that it is true in our approach these authors then observe that the similar phase of the neutrino mass mixing matrix will be discovered soon march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis eect appear in next to leading order diagram leads to the following operator lcp ccp zw w w w w w containing four charged gauge boson elds w elds and one neutral z yet sequent investigations in garcia recio and salcedo have not conrmed a non zero coecient for this operator but came up instead with a set operators of dimension possessing with a completly dierent structure another group brauner et al conrmed their nding remarkably all the operators oi found are c odd and p even while the above given is p odd and c even zahed and myself shuryak and zahed proposed to simplify the problem by splitting it into two separate parts quark in the loop moves in background eld so the natural basis in which one should approach the problem is that of dirac eigenstates for the dirac operator in this eld the propagators are in this representation diagonal as they are inverse to the dirac operator and contain quark masses in a standard manner the vertices are matrix elements of elds projected on currents made of one may start with diagonal vertices the heart of the problem is in performing avor summation with ckm trices and needed number of propagators the lowest order box is given by i tr v v v v here hats indicate that the ckm matrix v and the propagators are matrices in avor space the propagator also have labels u d indicating up or down type quarks the trace is over dirac and color indices as well slash with w eld as usual mean convolution of vector potential with gamma matrices the point is one should look rst at the avor trace multiplying matrices explicitly in mathematica and indeed the leading box diagram produces no cp violation we also found that if one add one z eld we still get zero adding two z one on u and one on d quark line does produce the expression f v sd v su v sd v su let us use representation in which the main operator is diagonalized so that where the notations with the slash here and below mean the convolution with the dirac matrices d the corresponding eucidean time propagator march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs scribing a quark of avor f propagating in the background can thus be written as the sum over modes y m m the generic fourth order diagram in the weak interaction containing necessary four ckm matrices takes in the coordinate representation the form t v v v v where v is the ckm matrix the hats on them and the propagators with u d subscripts indicate that they are the matrices in avor subspace and the trace is implied to be over avor indices if one consider next order diagrams with z eld vertices the expressions are generalized straightforwardly spin lorentz structure of the resulting eective action is very complicated to understand the scale dependence we will now we make strong simplifying tions first we will focus on the diagonal matrix elements of the operator and assume it to be approximately proportional to with some coecient second we assume that right handed operator can similarly be represented by diagonal matrix element we will call if so one can use the orthogonality condition of dierent modes and perform the integration over coordinates producing much simplied expression with a single sum over eigenvalues f where f t r v sd v su v sd v sd this is the diagram in the representation which generalizes the momentum resentation valid only for constant elds unlike momenta the spectrum of dirac eigenvalues may have various spectral densities in particular there is a zero mode corresponding to zero mode in the original dimensional symmetric case this describes the fermion production on various backgrounds such as the ing sphaleron independent of what physical meaning and spectrum of is the point is that one can perform multiplication of avor matrices and extract universal function of describing dependence of cp violation on the scale using the standard form of the ckm matrix v in terms of known three angles and the cp violating phase and also six known quark masses one can perform the multiplication of these avor matrices and identify the lowest order cp violating term of the result performing the multiplication in the combination above one nds march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis a complicated expression which does not have term so there is no lowest order cp violation this agrees with a statements from earlier works that the leadng th order diagram generates no operators higher order diagrams however do have such contributions for example if on top of w vertices with ckm matrices there are also two z avor trace looks as follows t r v sd v su v sdzsd v suzsu now the avor trace has the lowest order cp violation described by the following symmetric expression t t d b b u c f the numerator is the jarlskog combination of the ckm angles and dierences of masses squared as expected the eect vanishes when the mass spectrum of either u type or d type quarks gets degenerate a plot of this is shown in fig because of the cancellation between at the electroweak dierent quark avors it is very small at large about scale gev at the r s of the plot which can be called the jarlskog regime yet at the scale near and below gev so to say the smit regime it is twelve orders of magnitude larger these calculations show that for sphalerons produced by cold electroweak nario with size at the scale gev the cp odd eect is way too small to explain the baryon asymmetry if some mechanism will be found which can ate the sphaleron transitions with much large sizes say gev the cp violation in the ckm matrix would be sucient the cp violation in the background of exploding sphalerons the paper kharzeev et al performed evaluation of the cp violation in the background of exploding sphaleron which we will here follow but rst a general discussion of why exploding sphalerons are dierent from arbitrary background eld discussed in the previous subsection one obvious point is that as any classical object sphaleron has strong elds a gew and therefore in the expansion over the eld operators there is no coupling constant it is however still true that one can have perturbative expansion but with a parameter being deviation of ckm matrix from the unit one it is still true that cp violation requires at least four ckm matrices masses are all taken as they are in our world that is at higgs eld equal v however in a hot spot in which the sphaleron transition happens the higgs expectation value is smaller than in the broken phase v by certain factor one can take care of this by rescaling all by this v factor since the function is dimensionless its values are preserved and the plot just moves horizontally as a whole by this factor march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs fig the cp violating part of the w diagram imfzz gev the nontrivial point made by kharzeev et al is the so called topological stability the dirac operator in the background of a sphaleron explosion still sesses a topological zero surviving any gluon rescattering for this mode the formulae from the previous section can not be applied and cp violation needs to be calculated in a dierent way not going into detail we emphasize the physics in the broken phase t tew six dierent quarks obtain six dierent masses proportional to now nonzero higgs vev suppose sphalerons produce rst a particular quark say u in a ckm that this scenario is dierent from earlier ones based on small momenta not topologically protected from rescatterings which are march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electroweak sphalerons and primordial baryogenesis vertex it can morph into a dierent ones and then again combining amplitude and conjugated amplitudes one can single out interference diagrams with say four ckm vertices when quark propagates between those it gets a phase proportional to time and q mkw where mq is its mass and mkw thermal klimov weldon quark mass mkw gev induced by the real part of the forward scattering amplitude of a gluon on a quark dierent possible options with dierent intermediate avors interfere with each other and produce cp violating imaginary part this means that probability to produce quarks and antiquarks are not the same which leads to bau omitting details let me go to the answer from kharzeev et al for light quark u d production the asymmetry is acp j b m kw where the sphaleron size stands for typical distance between vertices it is also important that phase associated with top quark is large and those terms were cluded thus no top quark mass here is it enough for bau observed in a very crude way very small sphaleron rate in units of is basically cancelled by very long time t t near freezeout micro scale therefore up to a couple of orders of magnitude the cp asymmetry is the bau ratio so to my opinion the scenario works needless to say there is and will be long process of its scrutiny electroweak sphaleron explosion other potential ables sounds and gravity waves are naturally emitted at explosions and sphaleron explosions are no exception in a symmetric phase t tew we have explicit dependent solution of the classical yang mills equations ostrovsky et al shuryak and zahed from which one can calculate the stress tensor nents and see that the word explosion is not a metaphor here there is however a problem in the symmetric phase the sphaleron explosion is spherically ric and therefore can not radiate direct gravitational waves however the indirect gravitational waves can still be generated at this stage through the process sound sound gravity wave pointed out in after the ewpt at t tew the nonzero vev breaks the symmetry and the sphalerons and their explosions are no longer spherically symmetric but elliptic with a nonzero and time dependent quadrupole moment march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs they generate direct gravitational radiation the corresponding matrix elements of the stress tensor were evaluated in magnetic clouds and their linkage in the broken phase at t tew the original third component of the su non abelian gauge eld get mixed with electromagnetism producing physical massive z and a massless this mixing is controlled by the so called weinberg angle w therefore sphaleron explosions in this phase creates electromagnetic magnetic clouds since there are no electromagnetic magnetic monopoles they are not screened but survive till today as so called intergalactic magnetic clouds the interesting feature of those is that chirality of fermions electrons produced by sphalerons can be directly transported to chirality of the magnetic eld known as magnetic linkage or abelian chern simons number const the congurations with nonzero are called helical multiple sphaleron and anti sphaleron transitions create large number of left and right linked objects which would annihilate each other as quarks and antiquarks do but if there is a cp asymmetry between sphaleron and sphaleron transitions there would be remaining linkage which will not be able to annihilate as remaining quarks do therefore potential observation of helical misbalance in magnetic intergalactic elds today can be related to bau of course many magnetic phenomena may happen between electroweak sition and now one of them is the so called inverse cascade eect following from maxwell equation in matter with chiral unbalance and current proportional to netic eld cme discussion of them goes well beyond these lectures qcd sphalerons sphaleron transitions at the initial stage of heavy ion sions in these lectures we do not systematically discuss heavy ion collisions often referred to as the little bangs for our current purposes it is enough to point out few ilarities and important dierences from cosmology the big bang similarly both are explosions of systems much larger than the microscale of the matter involved expanding slowly enough to warrant adiabatic approximation and entropy tion in both cases we are interesting in crossing the phase transitions electroweak or qcd ones and phenomena associated with those it is assumed that most of excitations from the initial time has been relaxed to thermal equilibrium yet in both cases there are certain long wavelength acoustic modes with their relaxation time being so long that they do not die out from the intitation bang time both in cosmology and heavy ion collisions those are visible in nal matter march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd sphalerons distribution as acoustic microwave background temperature uctuations in mology and as azimuthal correlations in the little bang their physics is rather similar but in universe we speak about angular harmonics up to few thousands and heavy ion collisions up to or so both in principle tell us something about the initial state for big bang it is amplitude and statistical properties of initial quantum oscillations of whatever elds there were at big bang inaton for little bang it is much less mysterious initial positions of the nucleons at the moment of the collision of course in these lectures we are not interested in just initial distribution of matter densities in space resulting in such acoustic modes excitation our interest is in the initial distribution in relevant topological coordinates the chern simons number and its relaxation to equilibrium via certain instanton sphaleron tions high energy collisions of nuclei start from highly excited out of equilibrium tial stage of mostly gluonic eld unfortunately it is not easy to make reliable ab initio calculations of it all we experimentally know are the one body density matrix or gluon density functions pdf s as a function of their momentum tion very little is known about two gluon correlations or coherency of those gluons one popular view of it is color glass condesate model suggested by mclerran and venugopalan which views it as high occupancy classical gluonic eld if so it is calculated via classical yang mills equations with tain sources after collision the eld gets modied to still out of equilibrium and classical state of glue called glasma with system expansion and decreasing sity the occupation numbers eventually reach and thermal state of the gluon plasma is established studies of glasma are done by numerical real time solution of classical mills equation technically similar to simulations of out of equilibrium electroweak stage of the big bag we discussed above in this section we will follow work by mace schlichting and venugopalan mace et al in which you can also nd references on the previous works on the subject during the evolution of glasma there is diusive spread over the topological landscape so that measuring the chern simons number as a function of time one observes a typical diusive behavior see fig from mace et al cooled congurations by various method descend to the bottom of the topological scape that is toward zero energy and integer values of ncs shown by violet rectangular curve in the upper gure the lower gure shows the histogram of the distribution over ncs since in qcd there is no cp violation the curve is left right symmetric that is mean ncs the width of the distribution indicate the magnitude of the additional chiral imbalance in the typical events created between the time during the time interval taking say the characteristic parton momenta gev one nds that both the absolute time and time interval in glasma qs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs fig upper evolution of the chern simons number for a single non equilibrium uration dierent curves correspond to dierent extraction procedures lower histograms of the distribution over ncs at time qst are about m c taking this histogram as an example of that we see than r m s deviation corresponds to the diusive motion adding n r m s new transitions for light quark avors this corresponds to the added chiral charge of the congurations to be about cs qr m s n r m s cs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd sphalerons the rate of sphaleron transition decreases with time so the rst m c is dominant in such calculations note that we call diusive component ncs not just ncs because this is the amount of sphaleron transition generated in glasma on top of what it is at the time of the collision this initial value is the subject of the next subsection sphalerons from instant perturbations as we argue in most chapters of this book the qcd vacuum contains virtual elds which are topologically non trivial given certain amount of energy these virtual elds may become real excitations observable experimentally before we discuss specic proposal for experiments let us rst discuss some solvable mechanical example explaining the principle on which they are based we will show that basically if one wants to make some virtual elds of the vacuum real all one has to do is to clap the palms of one s hands strong enough indeed strong enough instantaneous perturbations applied to a system at some coordinate under the barrier will localize it in a state near the top of the barrier at the same value of the coordinate schematic picture of such excitation is indicated in fig by vertical red arrow in qcd setting we will study production of sphalrons in high energy collisions by instanton induced processes in the next chapter here we only outline the argument by a quantum mechanical example from my paper shuryak its main idea is that near instantaneous perturbation does not leave time to move change any coordinates including the topological ones while the energy can be changed by the amount determined by energy time uncetainty relation e as we will see under rapid perturbation the system jumps mostly on the barrier into the analogs of the sphaleron path states we discuss in this chapter let us consider a double well potential shown in fig and try to detect a particle s presence under the barrier near its middle point to do so one may t ocalized near and some introduce an external perturbation v time dependence f t standard solution is expanding f t into fourier integral and observing that frequencies tuned to the transition from the ground to the n th level would create real transitions one can calculate the probability of the en the results are plotted versus n as points in fig transition pn note that the peak excitation energy corresponds to the sphaleron excitation the in this example maximum of the potential v the reason for this is the following while there can be enough energy to excite the system to even higher states the overlap matrix element to those higher states with the ground wave function rapidly decreasing with excitation only near the maximum of the potential the nal spatial wave function is smooth enough and thus the overlap with the ground state wave function is large v n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big

arrow shows the direction of instantaneous excitation qcd sphalerons in experiments as we already discussed above the sphalerons were discovered in the context of troweak theory but because there is no hope to produce an electroweak sphaleron experimentally it has been mostly discussed in relation to cosmological tions now returning to qcd with its energy scale a factor lower one might think that sphaleron production happens routinely in any hadronic or heavy ion fig left the double well potential used excitation probability pn of the double well system versus the excitation energy two sets of

in in allinone qcd sphalerons collisions and is therefore studied throughout in experiments yet as we will now discuss only the former part of the previous sentence is true three suggestions of how one can observe the qcd sphalerons experimentally were discussed in literature we will go over these ideas briey here as discussion of real experiments would take us too far from the main goals of this book discussion of sphaleron excitation in high energy collisions has historically started in the setting of electroweak theory if observed it would be a ular demonstration of baryon and lepton number violation in standar model but s we already mentioned several times there are no prospects to do so nally still there were signicant theoretical eorts made and important insights were gained for a good review see mattis schrempp ringwald and collaborators applied this theory to lepton hadron deep inelastic scattering see moch et al and subsequent works the idea was to consider deep inelastic ep collisions with large momentum transfer q in which small size instantons will excite large mass m q sphalerons unlike perturbative processes resulting in a single quark jet or few jets with radiated hard gluons the sphaleron is expectted to decay into a high multiplicity near isotropic cluster of particles the idea was to keep the scale in the weak coupling domain so that the semiclassical calculation be well controlled say m gev unfortunately in this regime the cross section is too small compared to various perturbative processes and the project eventually collapsed since it was not possible to tell the signal from background another direction for experiments which can be called soft has been proposed by zahed and myself shuryak and zahed instead of hard gluons we propose to use soft pomerons focusing on the double diractive pp or collisions the sphaleron is expected to be found among various gluonic clusters which jump out of the vacuum at mid rapidity observation of the two scattered protons provide very constrained kinematics and dene the mass of the clusters there are some old experiments which observed few gev clusters of hadrons with an isotropic decay but theor quantum numbers were never controlled our suggestion was to look for certain exclusive channels related to the anomaly which tells us that quark state produced must be of the particular avor spin structure urul l r which would conrm or reject their topological origin similar argument was quite successful in the decays of c which we will discuss in the next chapter the scale of the sphaleron mass there should correspond to the average instanton size m corresponding to the sphaleron mass of about gev incidentally close to the mass of c the proposal to do these experiments at rhic star detector in the pp mode has been made but not yet done the third approach was suggested by kharzeev and collaborators kharzeev et al instead of looking for individual sphaleron transitions they proposed march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs r disbalance of the reball produced in heavy ion to observe total global chiral l collision by uctuating multiple sphaleron transitions note that the chiral charge is cp odd quantity and so its average value is of course zero in strong interactions its observation was proposed to do based on the so called chiral magnetic eect cme fukushima et al according to which the cp odd chiral disbalance leads to an electric current along the applied magnetic it is important that ambient matter should be quark gluon plasma at t tc in which chiral symmetry is unbroken and thus chiral disbalance remains conserved this suggestion has lead to signicant experimental activity we of course can not describe it here in detail the eect is clearly seen but possible backgrounds are not yet completely understood the experimental program continues at both rhic and lhc eventually we will learn the sphaleron rates both the primordial one from nonzero topology in the vacuum wave function as well as that in glasma experimental check of the sphaleron theory in qcd will no doubt strengthen also our understanding of electroweak sphalerons in the big bang diractive production of sphalerons after the correspondence between the instanton antiinstanton congurations and sphalerons has been elucidated let us return to high energy collisions following ref nowak et al calculations of the instanton induced scattering proceeded gradually first one can consider a single gluon exchange between the vacuum eld of the instanton and the quarks in this case a gluon is of course just a perturbative tail of an instanton a weak dipole shaped potential then came realization that any number of exchanged gluons are summed up in the wilson line which can be easily analytically evaluated in the background eld of the instanton the probability is the amplitude squared so it can be represented by the upper picture in fig in which it is assumed that the vertical line the unitarity cut is very much removed from the instanton so that its eld at the cut can be ignored the two parts of the plot are shown together but they are in fact independent matrix elements with a single soliton next came discussion of inelastic processes in which rst a gluon or few were passing through the cut such situation is shown by the left lower part of fig summing those gluons up resulting in a real breakthrough in the realization that the whole process can be described by a continuous semiclassical path starting in the vacuum under the barrier proceeding to a turning point and then to a real minkowskian evolution whatever way the system is driven it emerges from under the barrier via what we will call a turning state familiar from wkb semiclassical that the coecient between the current and led is in this case t even so unlike the usual ohmic current this one is a non dissipative one this observation will lead to multiple applications of the cme in condense matter physics and perhaps even electronics march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd sphalerons fig schematic representation of the amplitude squared with without gluon lines are shown in the left right side of the gure the dotted vertical line is the tarity cut the upper panel illustrates the quasi elastic at the parton level amplitudes where only color is exchanged the lower panel depicts inelastic processes in which some gluons cross the unitarity cut and some gluons are absorbed in the initial stage method in quantum mechanics the turning states released into the unitarity cut or minkowski world are the states we have already discussed from there starts the real time motion outside the barrier here the action is real and that means that whatever happens at this minkowski stage has the probability and can not aect the total cross section of the process this part of the path is only needed for understanding of the properties of the nal state eis so how we describe inelastic collisions and what is produced let me maries the main lesson of this section and also of the section on instantaneous excitation in the previous chapter in one sentence if the particle under the barrier is hit it jumps into the lowest state at the barrier with the same coordinate the collision amplitude corresponds to the process described by streamline rations describing classical solution with an external force along the topological valley exciting it to the sphaleron path march wspc book trim size for in in allinone sphaleron transitions in big and little bangs march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter chiral matter for extensive discussion of the history of the chiral eects see e kharzeev this terminology is rather recent and we clearly need to start with its explanation what is meant by it is some form of matter in which the following two conditions hold i a certain imbalance between the occupation of the and right handed fermions is created ii the lifetime of the chirality is suciently long compared to the timescale of the phenomenon considered so that quantum eects induced by the chiral anomaly discussed in the preceding chapter can be observed in chapter on instantons we discussed breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd we will see that in the qcd vacuum t and more generally for subcritical temperature t tc the non zero quark condensate violates the chiral left right symmetry present in the lagrangian in contrast to that the qgp at supercritical temperature t tc keeps the chiral symmetry unbroken and therefore provided chiral imbalance is somehow created it is our rst example of a chiral matter historically it was also the rst in which many eects to be discussed in this chapter were rst considered unfortunately qgp is quite expensive one need to have a relativistic collider to create it and so one may ask if there are other cheaper alternatives to illustrate this distinction quantitatively let me note that dirac equation for a free massive fermion conserves the vector current the fermion number but not the axial current the dierence between the number of the left and the right chirality components m because the mass term connects the left and right components of the elds in qgp one nds two light quarks called up and down or u d their masses are of the magnitude of few m ev much smaller than any other relevant scales and march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral matter since they play no role one can for simplicity consider them to be zero if so the r s of the equation above is also zero and this means that axial charge is also conserved a simpler way to understand the situation is to state that the number of left and right polarized quarks are conserved independently this is the chiral symmetry chiral electron quasiparticles can also exist in the so called semimetals the terminology which needs to be explained at this point is as follows as the reader surely knows the metals have the chemical potential inside the allowed zone of the electron state and thus there are fermi spheres with a non zero surface area insulators have the chemical potential located inside the forbidden energy zone and thus there is no fermi sphere of excitations with small energies the metals have free electrons to move by external elds and the insulators have not semimetals are in between with the point like touchings of the valence and conduction the so called dirac semimetals have the so called dirac point shared by left and right fermions near which linear relativistic like dispersion relation is valid there exist also weyl semimetals for which two chiralities have two separate touching points the quasiparticle modes near those points have the following hamitonian h vf where being pauli spin matrices it is of the kind originally suggested by weyl for uncharged massless fermions the rst observation of cme in condense matter setting li et al in zirconium pentatelluride zrt a dirac semimetal we will discuss this experiment in section on chiral magnetic eect electrodynamics in a cp violating matter chirality the product of spin and momentum for massless particles fermions or bosons e photons have two values commonly refered to as left and right since handed polarizations it is odd under p parity transformation mentum changes sign and spin does not thus matter in which there is left right disbalance is p odd that is not the same as its mirror image the subject of this section is however going well beyond violation of p parity to that of cp violating medium the physics of it was originally discussed in the context of the so called axion dynamics which is still hypothetical and is well beyond the scope of this book however it elucidated many interesting new eects which existence of eective pseudoscalar eld brings with it our discussion of it in the framework of so called modied maxwell chern simons electrodynamics has linear electron spectrum but it is a dimensional material while the anomaly phenomenon we need exists in dimensions march wspc book trim size for in in allinone electrodynamics in a cp violating matter follows ref kharzeev while the maxwell theory historically emerged term by term from certain ingenious experiments in modern textbooks all of them are derived from a single principle of gauge invariance requiring to change all derivatives of the charged elds by their covariant form d plus the statement that the gauge action can only be given by the only gauge invariant operator iea lm axwell f f the last point is required for consistency with expected symmetries such as the cp invariance the usual kinds of media modify maxwellian theory only slightly renormalizing the squares by coecients known as electric and magnetic permitivities and however if the condition of cp invariance is not required one have no reason not to add a term of the same dimension we will use it in the form lm cs f f aj f f where c is some coecient while will be treated as time and space dependent eld if one would add its kinetic and potential energies this axion eld can be upgraded to a separate dynamical entity but we will not do so and simply think of it as a matter induced coecient in a lagrangian now if it is just a constant one nds that the last term does not change the equations of motion because the term we added is in fact a full divergence where the current is known as chern simons current f f j cs j cs the volume integral of the full divergence can be rewritten as d integral of the current ux over the volume boundaries large sphere which unusally considered to be zero provided all elds vanish there if however is time space dependent the derivative can be passed to it by integration by parts so the last term in action can also be written as cs to make the lessons more familiar let us write the equations of motion in the non relativistic form introducing the following notations for the vector and axial currents m march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral matter here they are t t one can see that both electric and magnetic elds get their sources the r s of the rst and last eqns modied this leads to several new eects some of them we will mention the witten eect appears for nonzero for example consider a spherical defect a region in which vanishes while it is nonzero outside such a defect can be a vortex or a magnetic monopole we will discuss later on without new terms those would support magnetic eld only without but at nonzero the r s of the rst equation sources the electric eld as well thus a magnetic vortices or monopoles become also electric the electric charge separation in external magnetic eld also appears for nonzero the r s of the rst equation may be zero when the two terms cancel each other if the is time dependent and m chiral magnetic eect which we will discuss more in the nexts section is one one nds more unusual eects of them it is a vector current along the magnetic eld cm vanishing the r s of the last maxwell chern simons equation one can put and take constant which vanishes all other terms chiral magnetic eect cme and the chiral anomaly we start this section with some general discussion of space time symmetries and currents in the medium it will explain the required conditions under which the cme may exist the rst expression we start with is the ohmic current induced by the electric eld ohm march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral magnetic eect cme and the chiral anomaly if one watch this phenomenon in a mirror which means performing the so called p parity transformation both the l s and the r s vectors change sign so the coecient ohm remains unchanged imagine now that one ips the sign of time t t performing the so called t transformation the current is related with velocity of the charge and it changes sign the electric eld is only related with positions of the charges which ohm which created it therefore it is unchanged the conclusion is that ohm is not surprising since ohmic current is dissipative leading to increasing entropy of the media and thus it should be also dissipative in an imagined world in which time goes backward in superconductors the expression for a current proposed by london is london where the inducing eld is the vector potential if one recalls that contains t it be clear that must be t odd therefore london should be the same in our world and in backward time it follows that it can not lead to dissipation and the entropy growth and indeed supercurrents are eternal and non dissipative the cme is the vector current along the magnetic eld cm e transformation in a mirror of is sign changing while remains unchanged so cm e must be p so one may think about weak interaction eects like with neutrinos since they violate p parity by involving left handed fermions only under the t transformation both change sign as they are both related with velocities of the charges thus cm e must be t and therefore be non dissipative as the supercurrents are this agrees with the idea that magnetic eld whicle exerting a force on a moving charge does not make any work on it so if one can nd the conditions under which cme current can be produced it will not dissipate unlike the supercurrent it does not seem to require coherence and low temperatures the chiral anomaly not only lead to existence of cme in a chiral matter but provides the universal coecient of the eect in its operator form the expression is where is the chemical potential for the chiral according to kharzeev this argument has been made by v i zakharov the rst paper in which this formula was written was by vilenkin the setting was p violating due to left handed fermions neutrinos of weakly interacting sector near a rotating black hole existence of this current in equilibrium was questioned by c n yang and in the next paper vilenkin showed that the equilibrium current is in fact zero the resolution lies in the realization that the chiral matter is always metastable not in equilibrium march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral matter kharzeev and collaborators rst suggested to use qgp a good chiral matter and superstrong magnetic eld created by two positive colliding ions directed normal to the collision plane if vector cme current appears it will create electric dipole along which would be observed by a charge dependence of the elliptic ow of secondaries however since strong interactions are cp conserving the chiral imbalance can only appear as a uctuation it means that we can only observe cp even quadratic eect possible backgrounds of origins unrelated to cme or even to can inuence observations therefore strickly speaking the observations of cme in heavy ion collisions are not yet completely clear a special run at rhic with two nuclei having the same number of nucleons but dierent charge z are planned to at least separate dependent eects from others fig dirac cones of the left and right fermions in the presence of the changing chiral charge there is an asymmetry between the fermi energies of left and right fermions l r it is easier to explain the cme experiment with the semimetal in the absence of elds there is of course no chiral imbalance l r and there are equal number of left and right fermions but when parallel electric and magnetic elds are applied the change in the chiral density appears as illustrated in fig from kharzeev the time evolution of the chiral imbalance can be written as dt where the rst term in the r s again stems from the chiral anomaly and the second is the chiral density relaxation the stationary condition is reached at late is zero because the gain and loss terms in the r s cancel times then the l s march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral vortical eect each other so one get as well and putting it into the expression the chemical potential one would obtain the current this is indeed what is observed li et al in zirconium pentatelluride zrt and then in other materials potentially the cme current may be used in electronics providing non dissipative currents at room temperatures chiral vortical eect can a magnetic eld be substituted by another quantity possessing a similar p t parity e vorticity which we dene in relativistic notations by with velocity u the chiral vortical eect cve introduced in son and surowka kharzeev can be summarized by a relation j cv e with a vector current propagating along the vorticity a similar relation but of course with a dierent kinetic coecient can be written for the entropy current s son and surowka argued that entropy production must be positive s but kharzeev then argued that it should in fact be zero because of non dissipative nature of the eect these considerations lead to a specic expression for the coecient cv e in terms of matter eos so far i am not aware of any specic applications of the cve in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions specically vorticity is not zero but very small to be used for it the chiral waves the cme expression has an analog interchanging vector current to axial one and axial chemical potential to the usual vector one one also get the following expression as argued in burnier et al combining the two together one nds new oscillation mode called the chiral magnetic wave indeed divergence of the currents march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chiral matter can be substituted by time derivatives of the corresponding densities and two linear equation combined produce one equation of the second order so a heavy ion collision starting with certain baryon number density and leads to a quadrupole excitation in which the density and the chiral imbalance should oscillate into each other in the previous chapter we had shown how the density oscillations the sound modes were observed a search for the chiral magnetic wave is in progress in early universe chiral waves may perhaps lead to at least locally chiral netic elds if it is true it has a potential to contribute to baryon asymmetry puzzle we discussed before march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter instanton dyons the polyakov line and connement generalities let me remind the setting the nite temperature

fundamental one the temperature dependence of its vev is plotted in fig the left plot from kaczmarek et al is for pure gauge theory one can see that at high t below we will call it trivial holonomy limit because it nc corresponds to vanishing at t tc the vev is zero which corresponds to strict connement as one can see in the plot there is a nite jump from the value of about to so the transition is of the rst order the plot on the right side of fig from bazavov and petreczky is for qcd with light quarks in this case the vev is never strictly zero but decreases to rather small values gradually

order in magnitude and introducing one more one can proceed to their dierences in fig we show locations of the holonomy eigenvalues for the simplest case of the su gauge group for which most of the calculations is made in this case so there is only one parameter the vev of the polyakov line is m m t rp which means all i at high t p however in the temperature interval it changes to zero or small

these dierences will determined the masses of the corresponding charged nents and thus the core sizes which are i for the i th dyon it is also necessary to add the following the so called cartan subalgebra of all matrices diagonal mutally commuting generators for su nc are made of nc of the type the corresponding nc components of the gluon eld remains massless while the rest of them get nonzero mass from the term in the action for the case of two colors there is only one massless photon and two massive gluons for the physical case of three colors there are two massless photons and massive gluons since the instanton dyons are basically objects they are made of the gauge elds with two colors if one asks which ones those are dened by two ends of the corresponding segment i with which it is identied with namely colors i and i two subsequent dyon types say identied with segments i and have one color in common namely i with charges plus and minus respectively the dyon types which are not subsequent on the circle have no common photon charges and thus can not interact at large by coulomb like forces semiclassical instanton dyons the instanton dyon eld conguration in the chapter on monopoles it was many times stated that qcd like theories lack scalar elds some features depend heavily on that in particularly existence of chiral symmetries and physics related to them but it also presents a number of diculties to the physics of monopoles we already mentioned that one possible way to proceed is to use the th ponent of the gauge eld as adjoint scalar of course this is not a lorentz invariant choice but at nonzero t the frame in which matter is at rest is special anyway more importantly if one attempts to analytically continue the theory to minkowski formulation gets imaginary and the construction looses its meaning march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical instanton dyons name e m s sinst m m l l table electric charge magnetic charge and action in units of the instanton action for four types of the instanton dyons of the su gauge theory it is perhaps worth repeating that unlike particle monopoles discussed in the earlier chapter those instanton dyons are not particles in the ordinary sense the original name for instantons from belavin et al for any objects of the kind has been pseudo particles the distinction between the two types partcle or quasiparticle dyons are described in the usual minkowski world their mass squared is the sum of two positive terms originating from both limited from below by the so called bogomolny bounds proportional to their integer electric and magnetic charges ne nm respectively the pseudoparticle dyons like instantons are selfdual or antiselfdual in eiclidean formulation in minkowski notations this means that i and thus negative electric energy cancels the magnetic one to as it is well documented in the literature since s they semiclassically describe vacuum transition between dierent gauge nonequivalent topological classical vacua at zero classical energy historically their applications started from the top starting from the nite t instantons or calorons generalized to the case of a nonzero holonomy by kraan and van baal more or less at the same time lee and lu lee and lu derived it from certain brain construction related to ads cft only after plotting the action distribution it has been realized that instantons get split into nc pendent clusters the instanton monopoles or instanton dyons the technicality of the kvbll solution is very interesting theoretically but rather involved we return to it a bit later if the instanton constituents are very distant from each other one can of course rst study them as separate solitons and then try to do bottom up superposition of them before we discuss the solutions let us mention their quantum numbers for the simplest su color group there are types of dyons see table the charges and the mass in units of t for dyons cover all four possibilities for the electric and magnetic charges the m m dyons are the ordinary bps dyons which in the spherical march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons hedghog gauge is aa i r aa where na ra r is the radial unit vector the minus plus is for self antiself dual solutions and the two functions are vr vr vr vr the corresponding magnetic eld has the transverse and longitudinal stuctures which contained derivatives of these functions but can be rewritten without them as follows ba i ai nani while the former one exponentially decreases with the distance the longitudinal has behavior indicating the nonzero magnetic charge it of course matches the electric charge construction of the l l dyons starts from the same expressions in which the following substitution v v v is made but then it has a wrong asymptotics of the higgs eld this however can be remedied by the so called twist it is gauge transformation with the dependent matrix u exp the time derivative of which subtracts the unwanted from the higgs totics note that the color matrics commutes with the diagonal abelian part of the dyon eld leaving it as before but the core of the l dyon is made of a charged elds with colors thus the core is time dependent so the l l dyons are not static solutions and thus they do not exist in d theory and were not covered in the previous chapter it can only be dened in the nite t theory with the matsubara time the actions of the dyons are so if all self dual ones are summed using i i the result is the instanton action this statement so far demonstrated for a very distant non interacting dyons should in fact be true in general because selfduality relates the total action of the pbs dyons to their total charge i was often how is it possible to have separate objects with a non integer topological charge q the answer is they are independent in physical sense not in by polyakov himself march wspc book trim size for in in allinone semiclassical instanton dyons mathematical one as any monopoles they are interconnected by singular but invisible dirac strings this can be seen in two ways one is explicit contruction starting with well separated monopoles combed into a gauge in which the color direction of higgs is some xed direciton instanton is made of l m dyons with a string connecting their centers the explicit solution obtained for the single caloron in the kraan van baal paper kraan and van baal lead to this conclusion after plotting the action distribution the solution itself can be described using the so called prepotential scalar where here and below the temperature and circumference of the matsubara circle are temporarily put to t the matrices need to be multiplied in the order written right to left in the order corresponding to the magnitude of i are matrices am not to be confused with the gauge ordered the the following potential a are dened by the product of two matrices am rm cm sm sm cm is the distance with cm sm here rm are vector from the observation point to the m th dyon center and distances between dyons note further that the rst matrix is pure geometry independent of holonomies and the second is some hyperbolic rotation matrix by the angle including m th holonomy and distance to m th dyon the action density can be expressed in terms of prepotential in a surprisingly simple way t with two dimensional laplacians note that there are derivatives because the matrixes dene the prepotential in terms of which the eld potentials already have a derivative note also that the matrices am does not include time which is solely located in the cos function in the last term of thus the periodicity in the matsubara box is explicit exercise calculating for any holonomies and locations in mathematica is very straightforward do it and use the last expression for the action density do not look at the resulting huge expression but just plot its distribution e for parameters corresponding to fig order to explain how the gauge potential a was constructed one needs to understand nahm construction which i can not describe better than done in kraan van baal papers without that the formulae for a and g look like pure magic i decided not to go into it keeping only denition of and the action distribution dened in terms of this function alone march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons the construction itself is based on adhm multi instanton construction and the so called nahm version of it generalizing it to the monopoles it is too technical to be presented here see original paper kraan and van baal fig action densities for the caloron at in the plane dened by the centers of the three constituents for t and increasing temperature from top to bottom we choose mass parameters implemented by the constituents are located at and in units of t the proles are given on equal logarithmic scales cut o at an action density below e instanton dyon interactions large distance coulomb since the objects we now study have electric and magnetic coulomb elds at large one might naively expect that electric and magnetic coulomb distances r interaction are proportional to the usual products of the charges r yet this naturally looking expression turned out to be wrong let me start with a counterexample showing that it must be wrong we know that two self dual solitons m and l in particular can not classically interact at all since the total action is simply given by the total topological charge which can not depend on the distance between them and indeed plugging solutions into the action and performing the large distance march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon interactions expamsion one nds another funny looking but correct expression v r r with a minus sign in the electric term extra correction to the naive formulare above comes from the commutator of with other components of the gauge eld so in the l m case with charges from the table above there is no potential this expression for m m produces double attraction since their magnetic charges are opposite and electric are the same the lm case has the opposite thus it generates a double repulsion the dyon antidyon classical interaction combing the hedgehogs superposition of the dyons at nonzero is nontrivial since it should match not only in magnitude but also in its direction in the color space this is achieved by the following four step procedure i combing or going to a gauge in which the higgs eld v of a dyon at large distances is the same in all directions and for all objects performing a time dependent gauge transformation which removes v iii superimposing the dyons in this gauge iv making one more time dependent gauge transformation re introducing v back the details of the combing the hedgehog ansatz is invariant with respect to gauge transformations of the form r u eir however to superpose the dyon solutions we need to rst have the higgs go to a constant value at innity which does not depend on the direction this is into one direction accomplished by doing gauge transformation which converts r in the color space since the higgs eld is associated with the zero component of the gauge eld applying the time independent gauge transformation simply rotates the color direction of the eld further the selfdual and anti selfdual sector have asymptotic values of the higgs dier by a sign see diakonov so two matrices have to be used to gauge comb the selfdual and the selfdual dyon the gauge transformations are given by e e s we calculate the elds of a dyon and anti dyon in these elds if the selfduality march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons anti selfdualtity equation are satised then the solution to the elds are given by where we work in cylindrical coordinates in which this ansatz becomes aa aa i r coth sinh ar a r a r the upper sign in all equation corresponds to selfdual solutions this means that if we want to superpose the selfdual dyon and it s anti selfdual counterpart we rst have to make sure that goes to a common constant value we accomplish this the choice with the matrices namely the matrices s of the matrices which accomplish this is of course not unique we always have a choice of residual u symmetry u will take proceeding with the calculation we obtain that the holonomy of both the selfdual and anti selfdual dyon after this gauge transformation is and their spatial components are given as v for the selfdual dyon and ar a r cot r r a ar a r tan r r a however this gauge transformation apart from possessing a singular dirac string in the color direction has also multivalued color the reason for this is for the lines respectively multivaluednes of the gauge transformation we suggest a dierent gauge transformation in which the dirac string splits z direction but the elds remain single valued what s more since we want in march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon interactions to consider the superposition of dyon and anti dyon the dirac strings will cancel everywhere except in between two objects like in figure the gauge transformation we need is given by ei u the gauge eld then looks as follows fig d d with dirac ux canceling outside and adding inside ai ar a a cot where however superposing the two solutions is not as trivial as one may thing surely the abelian components will superpose properly and one may think that the tribution of the core is negligible as the core has exponentially small inuence however the string singularity makes any contribution of the core large and one must proceed with caution we rst examine a single monopole and compute it s magnetic eld in spherical coordinates the metric is given by the line element the radial component of the magnetic eld br can then be calculated f g where we sin taking into account just the abelian part we obtain exactly what we expect namely the sin term above turns cot into cos which upon dierentiation comes sin then dividing by sin we obtain br a where a is the color index the commutator of the core of a and a will correct the led so that it is not divergent in the center the more interesting cancelation is one of the sin magnetic eld b is dened as bi where the g is put because is a tensor density factors of r sin and r are inserted because a and a are neither contravariant nor covariant components of the vector eld ai but ar sin and ar are covariant components march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons string and the core in fact we will see that they conspire to cancel the contribution of the string the relevant term in a is the core then sin sin r cos where dots indicate the abelian part which we argued contributes to the expected eld of the monopole the commutator term becomes sin r cos which cancels the term in the derivative part of eld strength tensor however now we consider the superposition of the dyon and anti dyon we will have then that the elds are that of dyon and the abelian part of the anti dyon as the core contribution can be neglected therefore apart from the cancelation which we described before there will be a term of the form r r cot where we assumed now that r is a function of both and r the sign depends on whether the superposed eld is a monopole or antimonopole as well as how it is oriented i e whether the south poles of the system are facing eachother or is the south pole of the one facing the south pole of the other we will see that the sign we want is actually a relative minus sign between the two terms the equation above is just a simple separable dierential equation all that we have to do is express in terms of the spherical coordinates r the relation is the following cos the actual equation is ln r tan and the solution is cot cos sin e f we start by writing the elds of in cylindrical coordinates then we may simply march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon interactions fig two extreme positions for the dirac strings for the m m pair superpose the two elds the dyon becomes a a cos a r az a sin z following the gradient ow down the streamline as it is well known a combed monopole or dyon must possess the dirac string a singular gauge artifact propagating one unit of magnetic ux from innity to the dyon center by selecting appropriate gauge one can direct the dirac string to have arbitrary direction superimposing into a sum of two dyons with dierent directions of the dirac string one gets non equivalent congurations the interference of singular and regular terms make the dirac strings no longer invisible or pure gauge artifact however this is cured during the gradient ow process as we will discuss below two obvious extreme selections for the dirac strings are a minimally connected dipole when it goes along the line connecting two dyon centers and b a maximally disconnected pair in which the dirac strings go into the centers from two opposite directions see fig under the gradient ow the former is supposed to reach magnetically trivial conguration while the latter must relax to a pure gauge dirac string like state passing the ux through the system from minus to plus innity the former case seems to be simpler and more natural to use but our experience has shown the opposite that b generates smaller artifacts since the dirac strings interfere less with the gradient ow changes between the two objects so we will use case as our starting congurations below an important role in what follows is a color current s aa aansatz dab v gb v aansatz the current vanishes for extrema solutions of the ym equation such as a single dyon but it is nonzero for dyon antidyon congurations which we study it has march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons the meaning of the force in the functional space showing the direction towards a reduction of the action the study of dyon antidyon streamline congurations we will is due to larsen and shuryak the gradient ow is a process in a computer time thus the current would be the driving force in the paper we follow in this section a dyon antidyon pair was put on the the gradient ow process was found to proceed via the following i near initiation starting from relatively arbitrary ansatz one nds rapid pearance of artifacts and convergence toward the streamline set ii following the streamline itself the action decrease at this stage is small and steady the dyons basically approach each other with relatively small tions thus the concept of an interaction potential between them makes sense at this stage iii a metastable state at the streamline s end the action remains constant lution is very slow and consists of internal deformation of the dyons rather than further approach iv rapid collapse into the perturbative elds plus some pure gauge remnants we will detail properties of these stages below for now restricting to general comments one is the existence of the stage iii which has not been anticipated on general grounds since all congurations corresponding to it have the same action one can perhaps lump all of them into a new class of states corresponding to the same dyon antidyon distance unlike the instanton dyons themselves such states have not yet been identied on the lattice our other comment is the action value even at the end of the streamline is not that far from the sum of the two dyon masses in other words the classical interaction potential happens to be rather small numerically a welcoming feature for statistical mechanics simulations it should also be noted that while the topological and magnetic charges of m and m are opposite their electric charges are the same thus total value of it is rather than zero that is why they can not annihilate each other as instanton and antiinstanton do last but not least we do observe the universality of the streamline as pected independent on the initial dyon separation we found that gradient ow later learned that stable monopole antimonopole conguration and the potential leading to it has also been calculated in shnir was asked if it is possible to put it on the standard lattice with periodic boundary conditions the answer is negative the m m and any other interesting dyon pairs always have one of the charges electric or magnetic uncompensated furthermore for arbitrary holonomy the pair also do not have an integer topological charge so the lattices we used had no periodicity conditions at all me supply more colloquial names for these stages running downhill to the stream following the streamline nding a lake and then a waterfall march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon interactions proceeds through essentially the same set of congurations at stages iv thus one parameter characterization of those is possible a parameter we found most practical in this work is simply its lif etime duration in our computer time needed for a particular conguration to reach a nal collapse of course for tistical mechanics applications one better map that into some collective coordinate such as the dyon separation whatever way it can be dened s z v fig action density along the z axis in natural units for a separation between the centers of the dyons the conguration with the maximums furthest from each other is the start conguration after iterations it has moved further towards the center at iterations the conguration has reached the metastable conguration with a separation between the maximums of around at the conguration has collapsed around halfway and will continue to shrink until the action is times are as shown in fig rm r m iterations fig action for v as a function of computer time in units of iterations of all links for v between the m and m dyon from right to left in the a separation graph the action of two well separated dyons is rm r m we now show the results for a m and m dyon separated by a distance in natural march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons units v of the order to along the axis which is cooled using gradient ow the action of an individual dyon on the lattice was found to be lower that the analytic value this gives the action of for two well separated dyons any action lower than this therefore is ascribed to an attractive interaction between the dyons the simulations of the streamline for dierent congurations starts out with a slightly higher action around that of individual dyons this then converge to an almost stable conguration the streamline a typical action history is shown in fig for the initial separation values from to if the separation is bigger than the two cores of the dyons are seen to move towards each other and their action smoothy decreases we show four important computer times in fig where the action density is plotted along the axis along the dyons separation for at start conguration with a separation of between the dyon and antidyon the partition function in one loop electric screening the basic physics of the electric screening can be explained most simply following the original derivation by one of us shuryak in the coulomb gauge if some electrically charged object with nonzero is immersed into a nite tempreature qcd gluons and quarks of the heat bath are scattered on it the simplest diagram diagram comes from the quartic term in the gauge lagrangian which couples the heat bath gluons directly to square of but there are also other diagrams contributing to the forward scattering amplitude the result was the expression for the qcd debye mass m d t nf in when qcd was only years old the main nding was its positivity which ensured screening of a charge as opposed to anticreening by vacuum loops thus fig black solid line is the m m dimensionless potential action red dash line is the totic coulomb term blue dashed line is a sketch of possible core shape march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the partition function in one loop the plasma name the next relevant paper is pisarski and yae py who found in the one loop action of the calorons the nite t instantons the famous py term m d where is the instanton radius it also comes from the forward scattering amplitude of the thermal plasma quanta on the of the instanton this term is important because it ensures that at t tc only in this case there are thermal gluons the semiclassical expression provides nite instanton density going forward to calorons at nonzero holonomy the one loop eective action has been computed by diakonov gromov petrov and slizovskiy dgps diakonov et al the caloron is now a superposition of the m and l dyons separated by distance rm l and the basic expression from which the eect came looks as follows rl rm l where rl rm are distances from the dyon centers it thus creates an eect sembling linear connement with a force independent on the separation at zero holonomy this result matches the py answer because the relation between the stanton size and ml separation is rm l t the bracket in this integral is nothing else than one obvious consequence would be that if one would generalize the dgps derivation to theory with fermions they will simply get extra factor nf as in another one worth mentioning is that for pairs l l or m m with the same electric charge there will be plus in the integral above and thus the eect becomes repulsive the electric screening eect ensures lm binding into nite size instantons d note that the coupling cancels here into an object with a size rm l it is because the nonperturbative elds are always t e although asymptoticlly at nf this size is nf the coecient in makes it less important for interesting nf we will later see that the direct fermionic interaction discussed in the preceeding section binds l l pairs stronger than lm interaction since we will be discussing charge zero clusters consisting of all dyons let give an example of the potential electric screening creates in this case for simplicity we will only discuss l l at the same point and m m and l l to be on one line the integral r rm r m leads to a potential for m shown in fig as one can see like for dgps case it consists of linear segments but is now deformed away from the companion dyon march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons note that it is not due to their coulomb repulsion which is also there but will be discussed in the next supsection the one loop measure perturbative coulomb corrections and the core another important result of the dgps paper et al see also the inuential diakonov s lectures diakonov was the derivation of the forces decreasing with the distance also coming from the one loop gluonic combined with manton s result for identical dyons it was generalized to the bitrary number of selfdual l m dyons the resulting volume element in space of collective variables is expressed elegantly g via a determinant of the so called diakonov matrix g dened by g xi m t t i xj xi m n xk xi m t xj t xi m xk p here xi m denote the position of the ith dyon of type m this form is an polation of the exact metric between a m and l dyon true at any distance with the metric of the two dyons of same type at large distances we introduce a cuto cutof such that for one pair of dyons of same on the separation via r type the diagonal goes to for instead of minus innity note that while the matrix itself has only r terms but after the eective loop action is computed one gets all powers of r involing nontrivial manybody interactions in subsequent works see lectures diakonov for summary and references diakonov had used this interaction in the l m sector to perform manybody culation he argued that it can also leads to some integrable model which can be solved and even results in the holonomy potential leading to connement we think those conclusions were a bit premature because it somehow assumes that the selfdual l m sector and antiselfdual one l m are invisible to each other and do not interact at all not only we do not see why this should be the case we have found that dyon antidyon interactions are important and in theory with many fermions even dominant another issue is that for many congurations which obviously makes no sense for a volume element as some eigenvalue of g approach zero it means such conguration approach zero measure in the space of soluitons what it means precisely what was calculated and presented below is the volume element of the moduli space of all multi dyon congurations the geometry the metric tensor and the volume element of space of all classical multi monopole solutions has been studied in mathematical literature especially by attiya hitchin et al started from s march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic zero modes is that only those with should be included in the partition function this is relatively easy to do in numerical studies but was not taken care of in the original studies fermionic zero modes how quark zero modes are shared between the dyons the instanton has unit topological charge q and according to attiyah singer index theorem has one fermionic zero mode in the chapter about instantons we have discussed t hooft eective lagrangian arizing due to it now we discuss in which the instanton is split p zero holonomy environment at t into nc constituents the question is how the zero mode is distributed among these constituents as was determined by van baal and collaborators fermionic zero mode hops from one type of dyon to the next at certain critical values periodicity condition along the matsubara circle can be dened with some arbitrary angles f for quarks with the avor the resulting rule is it belogs to the dyon corresponding to the segment of the holonomy circle i to which the periodicity phase belongs i f in physical qcd all quarks are fermions and therefore f for all this case is schematically shown by blue dots in fig all fermions fall on the same segment of the circle and therefore only one of nc dyons have zero modes and interact with quarks but one can introduce other arrangements of these phases in particular for nc nf the opposite extreme is the so called qcd proposed in kouno et al put them symmetrically around the circle see fig in this case the instanton dyon framework becomes very symmetric each dyon interact with its own quark avor fig qcd right schematic explanation of the dierence between the usual qcd left and the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons the zero mode for the fundamental fermion we start with the dirac equation and look for a normalizable solution within the ansatz rj aa i ra aa h since the dirac operator is chiral we may write the fermion in terms of upper and lower components l and r we do the calculation for the lower component namely r the dirac equation then reads where we explicitly wrote the dirac indices and color indices a b now we see shnir a we may choose to consider the matrix in which case a a a a tr the rule of acting with a color and the spin sigma matrices on this object is such that we multiply by a color matrix from the left and if we multiply by a spin matrix then we multiply from the right and put a minus sign i e if we wish to construct fermion density we see that we now plug the ansatz into and obtain the following two equation h h r where we have assumed r condition in the imaginary time direction eizt i e that the fermion has arbitrary periodicity march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic zero modes let us look at the asymptotic behavior of dyons i e when r v and h r a then this equation is easily solvable by taking the substitution we get v v z e v z in order for the solution to be normalizable we must have that both at innity this is only possible if v we now proceed to numerical solution of the dierential equation the plots in vanish fig plot shows prole of zeromode components for four dierent values of z note that the zero mode delocalizes at z we may rewrite this equation in a two component form as dr where we can write the formal solution as a path ordered exponent exp p r dr the matrix can be written as follows r h r r a march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons the factor proportional to the unit matrix commutes with everything else and may be factored out on the other hand r a vr e is small and we may neglect it except at the origin so for r v we may integrate the exponent as it is proportional to only and then expand the result since h r ln we have that e v r r cosh sinh now we will solve the equation exactly to do this we separate the matrix m r as where i e the solution can then be written as exp r or with the dierential equation for reading m r r r a v r sinh rv dr v v z we may take a change of variables then the equation read march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic zero modes where we labeled we now eliminate and obtain the second order dierential equation a general solution with arbitrary constants is tanh e tanh e using the rst order equation we can write as coth e coth e the function is divergent when except if in which case therefore the constant can be determined by overall normalization the solution then becomes tanh coth finally we obtain v can be absorbed into constant and our nal expression is v sinh sinh with functions given by vr note that the value of is given by and the solution is completely regular at r elements of quark hopping matrix we calculate the fermionic transition amplitude between the dyons which is the operator with the proper background gauge eld expressed in the basis of the fermion zero modes of all dyons and anti dyons the transition element will look like td d d march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons where d d are dyonic and anti dyonic zero modes we assume a superposition ansatz of dyons and have that d d then since d d td d d in our solution we use d d and the transition element becomes tr du where ud d are gauge combing matrices for the dyon and anti dyon respectively remember that zero modes were found in a hedgehog gauge explicitly we use the form of the matrices ud u where and are spherical angles in the center of the dyon and anti dyon respectively these matrices have the following properties and u d u ud ud d d ud d u d u d d d u d d and where dyon respectively are spherical unit coordinate vectors around dyon and we rst consider the spatial index i we may use the matrices ud d to d i e transform d d d d dd d into an object d d d d d d ud dd du d d it can be shown that the transition element is given by the expression tr u du d dd r sin r since i sin cos march wspc book trim size for in in allinone fermionic zero modes after straightforward manipulations we obtain that the spatial part of the pression for the transition element is given by tr du d drd cot dd r the matrix u du d can be calculated u du d cos sin sin cos cos sin we write this expression as u du d a c where a sin cos sin cos cos cos sin sin fermionic zero mode for a set of selfdual dyons as a special example we consider the so called instanton antiinstanton molecule each of the instantons has one zero mode for fundamental fermions and there is only one amplitude of fermion exchange tia so the contribution of zero modes to the fermionic determinant is in this case simply which corresponds to the fact that instantons exchange one quark and one antiquark per avor at nonzero holonomy the instanton is described by nc dyons however simple generalization of the determinant construction to dyons would be wrong as dyons posess only a fraction of the topological charge in the instanton antiinstanton setting there is still only one left and one right handed fermionic zero modes those are however located in lumps near each dyon with some holonomy dependent coecients normalized as below l cl r i cl r i march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons where for l and r the sum runs only over dyons of particular self duality it is then obvious that the fermionic determinant is r l r c i cl j i j i j where i is an amplitude of hopping between a dyon and antidyon as usual if the dyons do not strongly overlap in space time such hopping amplitude is described by some coupling constants ai obtained by standard cutting the tail procedure for modes and the free fermionic propagator i ai note that at nonzero holonomy fermions are massive thus at zero t s exp ij and at nonzero t it depends dierently on temporal and spatial distance between the dyons we also remind that dierent color fermions have dierent masses although in the eigenframe of the holonomy the mass matrix and thus s is diagonal in color of course fermions moving in the background color eld of the gauge solitons do not conserve color but they do when they move in empty space in between them explicit expressions for ci ai can be found from expression for zero modes worked out in ref it is now straightforward to generalize this to congurations which have q stantons and q antiinstantons still with total topological charge zero there are q left and q right handed zero modes and the fermionic determinant in the partition function can be approximated by the determinant of the hopping matrix tij s instanton dyons on the lattice are seen via their fermionic zero modes when we discuss topology on the lattice we only once mentioned the dyons in the section on constrained cooling with the polyakov line preserved langfeld and ilgenfritz while the total topological charge of the lattice was always integer the clusters observed had smaller topological charge and the same actions as they were selfdual or antiselfdual using fermionic method allows to get better understanding of these objects since changing the periodicity phases one can see all types of the dyons separately while cooling still distort the congurations hunting for lowest or even zero dirac eigenvalues allows one to get the dyons as they are in the gauge ensemble one of the early studies of the kind was done by gattringer gattringer who used quarks with modied periodicity phases as a tool to locate all kinds of instanton dyons further studies along these lines have been continued by presussker ilgenfritz and collaborators see e bornyakov et al bornyakov march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons on the lattice are seen via their fermionic zero modes et al we however will jump to recent work by larsen sharma and myself larsen et al which shows the underlying instanton dyons in lattice qcd with most clarity due to application of the overlap fermions possessing exact chiral symmetry and thus exact index theorems out of congurations at t of qcd with realistic quark masses we selected those which have thus with one exactly zero mode by varying the periodicity phase we can identify location of all three type of dyons see e fig in which three dyons are see well separated we also see congurations of strongly overlapping ones fig density y of the zero mode of conf at t tc peak height has been scaled to be similar to that of not only we see that semiclassical formulae for zero modes well describe the lattics measurements when the dyons are far from each other they also work well in the case of partial or even complete overlap in fig the proles for single instanton is compared with that of overlapping dyons at the appropriate holonomy the latter is closer to the data we have analyzed many cases and in which the semiclassical expression from kraan and van baal are in agreement with the data much better than expected finally the lowest non zero modes show collectivized zero modes see example in fig furthermore near tc we can even see that one type of dyons show collectivized zero mode and thus a nonzero chiral condensate while in the same conguration the lowest nonzero modes of the other dyon type are still localized with chiral symmetry unbroken march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyons fig of the zero mode of conf at black and the log of the analytic formula for polyakov loop p and p though the maximum t red peak only has been scaled to t in height while blue peak uses the found normalization the position of the other dyons are blue and and red and fig chiral density y of the rst near zero mode of conf at t tc march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter instanton dyon ensembles we will study approaches to instanton dyon ensembles i the parametrically dilute ones then very dense in which case one can perhaps use the mean eld methods and statistical simulations which in principle can work at any density the last section of the chapter will be related with the so called avor holonomies or complex chemical potentials used as some diagnostic tool deformed qcd and dilute ensembles with connement perturbative holonomy potential and deformed qcd in the previous chapter we had discussed holonomy eld g as some classical constant background at this level it obviously does not lead to any energy since the corresponding elds g the next semiclassical approximation follows when one considers some tum eld a interacting with it since the holonomy is assumed to be diagonal in the color space the commutator am is non zero for non diagonal quantum gluons which are higgsed to become massive like in georgi gashow model quarks fundamental fermions interact with the holonomy via the term in the dirac lagrangian also getting a mass adjoint fermions to be briey discussed below have color indices like those of the gauge all of this leads to certain positive free energy rst calculated in the appendix in our current of the review by gross pisarski and yae gross et al to gluons only the adjoint quark species corresponding to the non diagonal color ators become massive this is in contrast to the usual fundamental quarks which are all aected by the polyakov higgsing march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles notation for adjoint bosonic majorana na fermions it has the form vgp y na t j i j where minus sign stands for periodic and plus for antiperiodic boundary conditions in the case it simplies to vsu t in pure gauge theory na the potential is positive and has minima at two symmetric points corresponding to the trivial holonomy and its copy in these limits one dyon is massless and another has the action of the instanton na normal fermions are anti periodic on a so the potential is the sum of two positive terms as expected from the mass argument given above however one may consider a theory in which the periodicity angle has any value one following unsal let us for now select bosonic spinor eld with periodic boundary conditions this leads to the following observations i standard nite t periodicity conditions are dierent for fermions and bosons thus supersymmetry is violated at t if however one forces the same periodicity conditions it is preserved the na case corresponds to caln supersymmetric theory and correspondingly the potential vanishes as gluons and gluinoes tions cancel each other ii at na no supersymmetry the sign is ipped and the minimum of the potential corresponds to the conning value in the latter case one of the deformed qcd versions there is connement both at small and large circle thus there is no deconnement phase transition in this setting although we will not discuss them let us mention another simpler versions of the deformed qcd also discussed in the literature one may simply add to the qcd action some articial potential depending on the polyakov line vdef pushing the minimum from the trivial p point to the conning value the instanton dyons in na sym n the pair gluon gluino adjoint majorana fermion eld constitute the shortest persymmetric multiplet so the theory we are going to discuss in this section is super yang mills before we turn to our main subject mostly known as properties of this theory compactied to with a small circle and periodic boundary conditions let me briey desccribe what we know about this theory it n that spinors get half rotation angle of the vectors so if the latter rotates by spinor rotates by example it can be interpreted as some external abelian gauge eld ux put through the circle in extra dimension we will return to this idea several time below as it provides an excellent diagnostic tool to test our understanding of topological phenomena in gauge theories march wspc book trim size for in in allinone deformed qcd and dilute ensembles with connement is very much qcd like and if compactication is thermal fermions are odic it also has deconnement and chiral restoration phase transitions according to lattice simulations bergner et al those two transitions happen at about the same critical temperature tc the only dierence with qcd is that the number of zero modes for adjoint fermion is so for nc t hooft eective vertex for an instanton has zero modes when chiral symmetry is broken its sign remains mined so unlike qcd this theory has remaining symmetry and two equivalent vacua as a result this theory has domain walls or kinks from this point on we follow the work by davis hollowood and khose davies et al the rst serious application of the the instanton dyons the setting of the paper is supersymmetric yang mills theory sym with a single supersymmetry it corresponds to na and periodic compactication dened on n as described in the previous subsection the importance of this application is in the fact that it has resolved the so called gluino condensate puzzle two methods to evaluate the value of the gluino condensate have two dierent answers namely w ci p v sci p v nc the abbreviations here stand for strong coupling instanton sci and weak coupling instanton wci approaches we will only review the former one nc now back to the setting gluino is the super partner of a gluon and means that there is only one type of the gluino it is real adjoint eld with spin so there are two fermionic states with gluonic polarizations it completes the simplest susy multiplet the selection of periodicity condition periodic for gluino preserves the supersymmetry which removes the gpy potential n the circle if small in length ensures weak coupling like high t the theory is strongly coupled like in the low t if the circle is large qcd the main dierence between the two theories is that unlike qcd in this setting for the sym there are neither deconnement nor chiral restoration phase transitions at any n discussion in the previous subsection had prepared the reader to the conclusion that the holonomy can be conning at any since the main obstacle the gpy potential is in this case absent now we need to understand why at small one may still have a broken chiral symmetry since it is a crucially important point let us for the moment interrupt the discussion of instanton dyons and return to the discussion of the issue in historical order starting with the instantons adjoint color gluinoes unlike the fundamentally charged quarks have not one but zero modes per unit topological charge q for the simplest gauge group march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles we discuss su it is instead of fermionic sources in the t hooft eective vertex per topological charge therefore unlike the nf qcd in which this with gluinoe vertex has the structure qq in the na theory it is instead lines this is similar to nf qcd but in this case we know that in this case the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken only at suciently low t tc large not at all t here is an outline of the instanton based calculation of the condensate the condensate has only gluino elds so in the sci calculation one did averaging of the square of the condensate with a single instanton amplitude and then argue that this function y can not depend on the distance and thus and one can apply the so called cluster decomposition is the same when y and get the sci answer for the condensate mentioned above the alternative calculation davies et al hollowood et al was revolutionary in that they had realized that in this setting the semiclassical objects which needs to be used are not instantons but instanton dyons the reason for it is that even in weak coupling small circle setting the holonomy is not trivial but the conf ining one for general nc i have homogeneous distribution on the circle diag i nc nc nc nc nc nc for nc there are just two holonomy values as usual with such holonomy setting and two colors the fermionic zero modes are spread equally between m and l dyons since m l instanton the total number of modes is still thus it is per dyon so the situation is not like in qcd with nf and quartic vertex but rather like in the nf theory and the quadratic vertex that is why there is no chiral restoration transition and the condensate can be calculated directly from dilute gas of the dyons the result of the explicit calculation based on the dyon measure in the form dnm m p v e sm where d is the center coordinate is the th collective coordinate corresponding to dyon color rotation around the holonomy direction and are grassmanian fermionic coordinates for zero modes the condensate is calculated in a standard diagram using zero modes original notations used in this paper are bps monopole for m dyon and kk monopole for l dyon march wspc book trim size for in in allinone deformed qcd and dilute ensembles with connement and additional simplication at large distances x where s is the massless fermion propagator at zero matsubara frequency time integrated the result is m m p v exp p v and it agrees exactly with the wci value but is dierent from the sci one the lesson the vacuum of bosonically compactied sym in weak pling regime is a dilute gas of the independent instanton dyons not a gas of tons n with na at very small circle dilute ular or bion ensembles study of the qcd adj na compactied to parametrically small circle was due to unsal unsal the setting is the same as in the previous subsection namely the periodicity is bosonic reversing the sign of the quark contribution to the gpy vacuum energy as we had discussed previously for na this cancels the gpy potential but for na the sign of the gpy potential is reversed and its minimum corresponds to the conning holonomy the rst point to focus on is the distinction between the space in the case of polyakov s connement and the setting with a small circle we consider now both setting have time independent monopoles we call the m but in the latter case there exist also the time twisted kk or l type monopole as well the next question is what happens with chiral symmetries in such setting when for na in general the eective t hooft lagrangian per dyon is example for na it is the fermion vertex similar to that of the njl model since the eective njl coupling the density of the dyons is exponentially small at weak coupling setting small circle there is no spontaneously broken chiral symmetries the density of the individual dyons are thus zero note that this is the same phenomenon which we discussed in chapter on stantons in the usual qcd with massless quarks since instantons become eective for nf and since there is no chiral symmetry at high vertices of the type t in qgp the density of the individual instantons vanishes there remain however clusters with the topological charge zero in particularly the instanton antiinstanton molecules the ensemble in this case is a moleculecular gas made of antisoliton pairs bound by quark exchanges ilgenfritz and shuryak in the conning setting on for there are dyon antidyon pairs bound by fermion exchanges unsal unsal call these binary objects bions march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles introducing deviation from conning holonomy as and magnetic one can write down amplitudes for all types of dyons of the gauge group m bp s e m bp s e i l kk i l kk where we use both unsal and our notations for the instanton monopoles dyons the instanton is lm pair so in the combined amplitude the lm product of individual amplitudes all prefactors cancel out except the instanton action e with fermion operator let us now still following unsal form all possible dyon pairs the fermions are saturated between the pairs for any na so we do not write them anymore although they of course lead to extra factors in actual expression of the molec m m bp sbp s e ll kkkk e lm kkbp s e m l bp skk e the main idea of unsal was to focus on the second raw the bions which are twice magnetically charged since those have nonzero but still exponentially small sity and nonzero magnetic charge they will screen the magnetic charge precisely as a single monopole does in the polyakov connement so these magnetically charged bions do enforce the connement the next important point from this work is that the eective action due to all types of the bions should lead if the na case to the eective action of the type lef ae based on supersymmetry arguments the rst comment the minimum of the potential requires or it is the conning one the second surprising observation follows from the expansion of this lagrangian to terms both holonomies should have in this theory the same screening masses as we will see below in non supersymmetric theories those masses are always dierent and have very dierent t the question is how can it be understood microscopically earlier in this chapter we discussed long distance classical binary interactions and concluded that m m ll channels are attractive while m l lm are repulsive in the latter case the repulsion can be overcome by fermion exchanges so the integral over the inter dyon distance is converging both at small and at large that in the polyakov connement subsection it was called for zero topological charge objects one can correctly couple zero modes to each other so that there remains no zero modes left march wspc book trim size for in in allinone deformed qcd and dilute ensembles with connement distances however in the former case both bosonic and fermionic interactions are attractive the integral is thus converging only due to the core why both integrals are the same i can not answer it is one of the miracles induced by supersymmetry with na and periodic compactication on the lattice in this subsection we continue to discuss the same setting a theory on with periodic compactication but add one more adjoint majorana gluino of course this theory is not supersymmetric for its general discussion see myers and ogilvie however there were lattice studies of this theory cossu and delia with variable circumference of the circle called in this paper lc the lattice simulations had found four distinct phases which we subsequently briey describe i at large lc low temperature one nds the usual conning phase with the polyakov vev p and symmetric distribution of its eigenvalue consistent with unbroken center symmetry as the lc gets shorter one observes the deconnement transition in which and its eigenvalues distributed along one of the center elements p ing the center symmetry iii as the lc gets even shorter in some nite interval of lc there exists another deconned phase in which eigenvalues distributed along a direction opposite ing angle that in the usual one this phase was predicted by myers and ogilvie at very small lc high temperature the theory returns to center symmetric conned phase this is consistent with the arguments made above based on the gpy potential the authors called it re conned phase fig from cossu and delia shows polyakov line eigenvalues as a function of the circle circumference lc the most important consequence of this study is that it contradicts to the conjectured volume independence contrary to naive interpolation two conned phases are not smoothly connected since it is a lattice work with a nonzero gluino masses and nite lattice spacings one may ask to what extent their zero limits have been reliably reached fig shows limit the phase iii may disappear as such option is within the that in the m numerical accuracy but the other deconned phase ii seems denitely be there also in the chiral limit what about the fate of the chiral symmetry breaking through all these tions remarkably but in agreement with other studies of the with mal compactication it was observed in cossu and delia that in the whole region of lc studied so massless fermions keep their nonzero stituent quark mass throughout the two or maybe one deconned phases are march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles fig upper scatter plot of the polyakov line eignevalues as a function of the size of the compactied dimension lc subsequent phases are seen lower the phase diagram on the plot quark mass am and lattice gauge coupling extrapolation of the phase boundaries to the chiral limit for split phase is not obvious then a plasma of constituent quarks the magnitude of the condensate howeever decreases by about an order of magnitude from vacuum large lc value suggesting that chiral symmetry is going to be eventually restored just at very small lc not included in these particular set of simulations cossu and delia eventually the na theory with small circle should of course have zero gluino condesate as was argued in the previous section march wspc book trim size for in in allinone dense dyon plasma in the mean eld approximation dense dyon plasma in the mean eld approximation the main idea of the mean eld approximation is that a particle interact neously with one may think that it can be used in cases when the ensemble of the dyons is dense enough producing strong screening which eectively reduces the pair wise correlations anyway using some average mean eld is the simplest approach in which one can get analytical evaluation of the observables in this section we will follow a series of papers by liu zahed and myself using the mean eld approximation the rst paper of the series liu et al had established the approximation in the technical sense here there is no place to present technical details of these works and we just summarize few important points and the results the main result is that dense enough dyon ensemble does overcome the gpy potential and shift the minimum of the free energy to the conning value for the gauge theory considered the key expression for the partition function is put into the form lnz videal ln v m d m where videal describes free energy of the non interaction dyons v p is the fourier transform of the dyon antidyon potential classical or including one loop the very presence of dyons with electric charges generates a debye electric screening t related to the dyon density nd when this density is large mass md m is large from expression of the partition function it follows that the eect of the potential inside the logarithm gets reduced screened out which in principle justify the mean eld method specic applicability limits of it can be derived from requirement that the second term inside the log is less than fig illustrates one of the results of this work the temperature dependence of the electric and magnetic screening masses in comparison to what has been derived from numerical simulations of the su gauge theory note that the electric screening shown by the closed circles has a drop downward as t is reduced below the deconnement transition while the magnetic screening is expected to get larger than the electric one there note that this condition is necessary but in general not sucient for example the approximation is valid in the perturbative debye theory of plasma e for the monopole plasma discussed by polyakov it is not valid in strongly coupled plasmas which may be strongly correlated liquids or even solids producing mean elds very dierent from being space independent otherwise the argument is negative and logarithm gives an imaginary part signaling appearance of an instability for clarity while the calculation includes only dyons but not gluons it does include the one loop gpy potential its derivative over the holonomy value is the perturbative one loop electric debye mass due to gluons march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles fig the electric me dashed line and magnetic mm solid line screening masses versus t the points are the lattice data for su gauge theory shown for comparison blue circles are electric red squares are magnetic the next work of the series liu et al applies mfa to the nc color theory with nf light quark avors at high density the minimum of the free energy still corresponds to the conning ensemble with the gap equation for the eective quark mass proportional the quark condensate of liu et al the usual form ef p m m ef p nl where the r s is the density of the dyon type possessing the fermion zero mode namely the l dyons the equation is actually for the parameter in the eective mass mef f p pt p in which t p being the fourier transform of the hopping matrix element calculated using the fermionic zero mode momentum dependence of m is universal and is shown in fig in practice the best way to solve the gap equation is to calculate the momentum integral in its l s numerically and then parameterize the dependence on parameter a generalization of the mean eld treatment to arbitrary number of colors and avors in liu et al shows that this gap equation has nonzero solutions for the quark condensate only if nf so the critical number of avors is nf for nc the lattice simulation indeed show weakening of chiral symmetry violation eects with increasing nf but specic results about on the end of chiral symmetry breaking are so far rather incomplete for nc we know that in the nf case the chiral symmetry is broken the case nf is not yet completely decided and nf seems to be already in the conformal window march wspc book trim size for in in allinone statistical simulations of the instanton dyon ensembles fig the momentum dependent constituent quark mass t m versus momentum in units of temperature p t another important generalization for quarks in the adjoint representation is made in a separate paper liu et al the number of fermionic zero modes increases and they are more complicated in the symmetric dense phase both m and l dyons have two zero modes but the actual diculty is not some longer expressions but the fact that one of them has rather singular behavior gets delocalized exactly at the conning value of the holonomy therefore in the case of adjoint quarks the approach toward the conning phase needs some special care in the case nc na the deconnement and chiral restoration happen at about the same temperature in agreement with lattice result we discussed above for this theory statistical simulations of the instanton dyon ensembles holonomy potential and deconnement in pure gauge theory the rst direct simulation of the instanton dyon ensemble with dynamical fermions has been made by faccioli and shuryak the general setting follows the ample of the instanton liquid it included the determinantof the so called ping matrix a part of the dirac operator in the quasizero mode sector it has been done for su color group and the number of fermions avors nf except in the last case chiral symmetry breaking has been clearly observed for dense enough dyon ensemble the second one by larsen and myself larsen and shuryak uses direct numerical simulation of the instanton dyon ensemble both in the high t dilute and low t dense regime the holonomy potential as a function of all parameters of the model is determined and minimized in fig from this work we show the dependence of the total free energy march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles on holonomy value for dierent ensemble densities this important had shown for the rst time in direct simulations that at high density of the dyons their back reaction does generate connement indeed the minimum of the holonomy potentials shifts to the conning value for the consistent parameters of the ensemble minimizing the free energy is determined for each density as the action parameter s is growing corresponding to growing temperature the dyon symmetric phase goes into an asymmetric phase in which the density of m and l dyons are not the same see fig the l dyon has larger action due to time dependent twist and thus smaller density the next simulations of the instanton dyon ensemble for su gauge group has been done by lopez ruiz y jiang and j liao lopez ruiz et al in fig from this work we show the shapes of the holonomy potential v near the critical point and the t to the average value of the polyakov line tted to the expected second order behavior with indices of the ising model within the statistical accuracy of the calculation the expected second order ior is indeed observed the free energy potential between static quark and antiquark from lopez ruiz et al is shown in fig note rst that the potential is nearly ature independent below tc the rst two sets but rapidly decreases above tc while the fundamental quarks show nearly linear conning potential the adjoint one shows screening aboove certain distance this is as expected for pure gauge theory without another important issue addressed in lopez ruiz et al is the area law for the spatial wilson loop the corresponding measurements are reported the existence of the spatial tension is demonstrated but its temperature dependence is not yet compared to the avilable lattice data instanton dyon ensemble and chiral symmetry breaking the issue of chiral symmetry breaking using numerical simulations were addressed by larsen and shuryak including the fermionic determinant in hopping approximation we calculated the spectrum of the lowest dirac eigenvalues extracting the quark condensate is complicated as usual by nite size eects using two sizes of the system with and dyons we identify the nite size eects in the eigenvalue distribution and extrapolate to innite size system the analysis improved statistical accuracy of the data points we nevertheless show here the rst plot in which the connement had came out of the simulations that the simulation includes dyons but not gluons which however are also integer charged and can screen the adjoint charge march wspc book trim size for in in

imaginary chemical potential denoted by appears in the periodicity condition over the matsubara circle as we already mentioned for real the sign problem is absent and standard monte carlo algorithms can be applied to simulate lattice qcd qcd possesses rich phase structure at nonzero details of which depend on the number of avors nf and the quark mass masses later in the section we will make it even reacher by considering dierent phases for dierent quark avors f since is an angle it is obvious that the qcd partition function z is a periodic function of it with the period however as noted in roberge and weiss the period is actually smaller nc and there is the so called the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles roberge weiss symmetry because of nc branches of the gluonic gpy potential the main point is that the imaginary chemical potential simply shifts nc in the quark term c of the gpy one loop eective potential in pure gauge theory at suciently large t there is spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry and one of the nc branches is selected for example su theory has one real and two complex conjugated branches recall that in qcd the quark term is not center symmetric thus the free energy is tilted and the real branch is the preferred one the mean p slowly moves as a function of t along the real axes as described above if there is a nonzero it eectively rotates the quark part of the potential and at certain values k in this theory the free energies of dierent brunches cross as a result there appear kinks the order phase transitions at such values these points are crossings of the nc branches of the eective potential as shown in fig at any the physical branch is the lowest one fig eective gpy potential as a function of the imaginary chemical potential for colors nc since these arguments are derived using the one loop gpy potential they of course valid only at high t or weak coupling in reality the rw transition exists at t trw

the subject or two pseudocritical lines meat each other and then go vertically to the critical point fig from bonati et al illustrates current state of lattice answer to this question inside the accuracy of the current data the answer to this question seems to select the former option to this question qcd the main idea of this deformation of nc nf qcd kouno et al is a cratic distribution of avor holonomies putting those in between the subsequent holonomy phases i see fig right the framework in which it has been suggested is the pnjl model in the theory of the instanton dyons qcd has a very simple meaning each dyon type get a zero mode of one quark avor the qcd has been studied in the mean eld framework liu et al by statistical simulations larsen and shuryak and also by lattice march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton dyon ensembles simulations misumi et al in the dilute limit it also has been studied by cherman et al the rst two papers consider the nc nf version of the theory while the last one focus on the nc nf in the former case the set of phases are f so one quark is a boson and one is a fermion in the latter f left the mean polyakov line p versus

temperature by s log t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd with avor dependent periodicity phases si the dyons share it as sm s sl s so larger s at the r s of the gure correpond to high t and thus to more dilute ensemble since densities contain exp all three studies see a non zero chiral condensates in the studied region of sities perhaps no chiral restoration happens at all the value fo the condensate are shown in fig from larsen and shuryak the simulation liu et al demonstrate that the spectrum of the dirac eigenvalues has a very triangular shape characteristic of a qcd this explains why the qcd has much larger condensate than ordinary qcd at the same dyon density and also why there is no tenedecy to restoration as dd but with dierence expected all works see dierent condensates smaller than one could expect from the dierence in the dyon density in cherman et al the authors study the periodic compactication to a small circle with qcd avor holonomies the main statement is that even in the limit of very small circle exponentially small dyon density in this setting the chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken but in a very as usual equal to way there are however only nc the number of cartan subalgebra generators massless pions not n roberge weiss transitions and instanton dyons in subsection we introduced the roberge weiss transitions and discussed some lattice studies of them let us remind the reader that imaginary chemical potential is a phase or avor holonomy which eectively rotates quarks on the holonomy circle here we will discuss the role of in the theory of the instanton dyons as discussed in the previous chapter and also previous subsection the fermionic zero modes jump from one kind of instanton dyons to another when the avor and color holonomies coinside therefore instanton dyons should play a very important role in the roberge weiss transitions the rst lattice study of this phenomenon has been performed in its main result is demonstration of dramatic changes in the dirac et al eigenvalue spectra as the lines of the roberge weiss transitions are crossed the authors use variable periodicity angle as a diagnostic tool allowing to monitor eigenvalues for each kind of dyons separately the left gure fig demonstrate eigenvalue spectra for two congurations on both sides of rw sition the dyon spectra are clearly

curves one dashed blue curve and one green dotted curve generated at t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter the poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions we discussed a number of applications of the monopoles in particular the ment is indeed a bose einstein condensation of monopoles at t tc there are multiple applications to physics of quark gluon plasma and heavy ion collisions sically qgp is a dual plasma made of electrically charged quasiparticles quarks and gluons and magnetically charged monopoles leads to explanation of various observed phenomena the key yo all of it is the notion that monopoles can be treated as quasiparticles and use them both in calculations involving euclidean thermodynamics or minkowski kinetics times as needed however the t hooft solution require an adjoint scalar higgs with a non zero vev this is the case in the georgi glashow model and in other theories with an adjoint scalar eld notably in theories with extended supersymmetry yet it is not so in qcd like theories without scalars and thus one can not use this solution n in the chapter devoted to instanton dyons the t hooft solution will be used with the time component of the gauge eld as an adjoint scalar the semiclassical theory built on them obviously can only be used in the euclidean time formulation an analytic continuation of to minkowski time include an imaginary eld which makes no sense so the instanton dyons can not be used as quasiparticles and yet the presence of magnetic charge of the instanton dyons does suggest that they should somehow be related to particle monopoles a gradual understanding of this statement began some time ago but remained rather unnoticed by the larger community one reason for that was the setting in which it was shown which was based on extended supersymmetry only in these cases was one able to derive reliably both partition functions in terms of monopoles and instanton dyons and show them to be equal dorey and parnachev poppitz and unsal poppitz et al furthermore they were not summed up to an analytic answer but shown instead to be related by the so called poisson duality march wspc book trim size for in in allinone poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions the rotator another classic example which display features important for physics to be cussed in this book is a rotating object which we will call the rotator or the top what is special in this case is that the coordinates describing its location are angles which are always dened with some natural periodicity conditions denition of the path integrals in such cases require important additional the key questions and solutions can be explained following schulman schulman using the simplest top a particle moving on a circle its location is dened by the angle and its initial action contains only the kinetic term s with the corresponding moment of inertia for rotation all possible paths are naturally split into topological homotopy classes dened by their winding number the paths belonging to dierent classes can not be tinuously deformed to each other therefore a fundamental question arises how should one normalize those disjoint path integrals over classes of paths clearly there is no natural way to dene their relative normalization or rather their tive phase following aharonov and bohm aharonov and bohm one may provide a direct physical interpretation of this setting suppose our particle has an abelian electric charge and certain device existing in extra dimensions invisible to the rotator creates a nonzero magnetic eld ux through the circle stokes theorem relates it to the circulation of the gauge eld da while is gauge dependent its circulation called holonomy is gauge ant since it is related to the eld the extra phase is thus physical furthermore it propagates into the energy spectra and the partition function one can write it in a hamiltonian way as the sum over states with the angular momentum m at temperature t exp im where is the holonomy phase which is so far arbitrary in the feynman hibbs book does not have its discussion and contains only a comment that the authors can not describe say an electron with spin and that it was a serious limitation of the approach non abelian case there is no stokes theorem but gauge invariance of all closed paths is still true it follows from direct calculation of gauge transformation of path ordered exponents march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the rotator although physical the eect is invisible at the classical level this can be seen from the inclusion of the additional term in the action d which would explain the holonomy phase this term in lagrangian however is a full derivative so the action depends on the endpoints of the paths only and is insensitive to its smooth deformations it therefore generates no contribution to classical equations of motion thus failing to exert any force on the particle in classical sense in summary an appearance of the holonomy phase is our rst nontrivial quantum eect not coming from the classical action now one can also use lagrangian approach looking for paths periodic in clidean time on the matsubara circle classes of paths which make a dierent ber n of rotations around the original circle can be dened as straight classical periodic paths plus small uctuations around them carrying out a gaussian integral over them leads to the following partition function exp t the key point here is that these quantum numbers m used for and n for are very dierent in nature the dependence on the temperature is dierent also for each term of the sum is periodic in while for this property is also true but recovered only after summation over n in spite of such dierences both expressions are in fact the same in this toy model it is possible to do the sums numerically and plot the results furthermore one can also derive the analytic expressions expressible in terms of the elliptic theta function of the third kind exp which is plotted in fig for few values of the temperature t in order to prove that one may use the jacobi identity t t t as emphasized by our recent work ramamurti et al one can observe that two statistical sums are related by the poisson summation formula in a form np p l p f p where is some function f is its fourier transform and p is the period of both sums as a function of the phase in this particular example the function march wspc book trim size for in in allinone poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions fig the partition function z of the rotator as a function of the external aharonov bohm phase two periods are shown to emphasize its periodicity the blue solid red dashed and green dash dotted curves are for is gaussian with fourier transform being a periodic gaussian but we will later encounter examples of the poisson duality with other functions as well the generalization to path integrals dened on other groups can proceed larly schulman schulman in particularly was interested in the rotation over the group a manyfold with three euler angles instead of innitely many topological classes of paths in this case there are two classes the arbitrariness reduces to the relative sign between them case plus leads to bosons and minus to fermions the interested reader should consult literature on path integrals over lie groups for our purposes the simplest circle case would be sucient in summary the rotator serves as an example of path integral on manifolds which have topologically distinct classes of paths lesson number one is that their ambiguous relative normalization allows to recognize hidden quantum phase lesson number two is that this is the simplest example in which the hamiltonian and lagrangian ways to calculate the statistical sum lead to dierently looking although poisson dual results monopoles versus instantons in extended supersymmetry in the and compactication to the setting of these studies are in weak coupling g theory the charge does not run and g is simply an input parameter in the theory however the coupling does run and one needs to select the circumference of the circle to be small enough such that the n n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopoles versus instantons in extended supersymmetry are large enough to ensure weak coupling compactication ing frequencies of one coordinate to the circle is needed to introduce holonomies gauge invariant dxc of the electric and magnetic potentials integrals over the circle respectively their values can have nonzero expectation values which can be viewed as external parameters given by aharonov bohm uxes through the circle induced by elds in extra dimensions these holonomies will play important role in what follows dorey et al dorey call these external parameters and tively finally in order to make the discussion simpler one assumes the minimal non abelian color group with the number of colors nc this group has only one single diagonal generator breaking the color group n the theories with extended supersymmetry have one and six adjoint scalar elds respectively recall that these two theories also have respectively and fermions so that the balance between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is perfect for simplicity all vacuum expectation values vev of the scalars as well as both holonomies are assumed to be in this diagonal direction so the scalar vevs and and are single valued parameters without indices in the general group the number of diagonal directions is the abelian subgroup and thus the number of parameters is nc the particle monopole mass is m case following dorey and collaborators dorey we will only discuss the six scalars and two holonomies can be combined to vacua parameterized by scalars extended by supersymmetry to chiral supermultiplets these fermions have zero modes describing their binding to monopoles we will however not discuss any of those in detail n the monopole has four collective coordinates three of which are related with translational symmetry and location in space while the fourth is rotation around the color direction note that such rotation leaves unchanged the presumed vevs of the higgses and holonomies as well as the abelian r tails of the monopole solution ertheless these rotations are meaningful because they do rotate the monopole core made up of non abelian elds nontrivially it is this rotation in the angle that makes the monopole problem similar to a quantum rotator as was explained by julia and zee julia and zee the corresponding integer angular momentum is nothing but the electric charge of the rotating monopole denoted by q now that we understand the monopoles and their rotated states one can dene the partition function at certain temperature which anticipating the next sections march wspc book trim size for in in allinone poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions we will call t zmono m exp ik iq km where k is the magnetic charge of the monopole the derivation can be found in the original paper and we only comment that the temperature in the exponent only appears twice in the denominators of the mass and the rotation terms as expected iq are the only places where the two other terms in the exponent holonomies appear as the phases picked up by magnetic and electric charges over the circle now we derive an alternative version of the theory in which we will look at gauge eld congurations in all coordinates including the compactied time dinate these objects are versions of instantons split by a nonzero holonomy into instanton constituents since these gauge eld congurations need to be riodic on the circle and this condition can be satised by paths adding arbitrary number n of rotations their actions are sn mono including the contribution from the scalar vev the electric holonomy and the winding number of the path n in the absence of the holonomies the rst term would be m t as one would expect the partition function then takes the form dorey m zinst ik km exp where m the bps monopole mass without holonomies thus the second term in the exponent is interpreted as just the boltzmann factor the ture appears in the unusual place in the last term like for the rotator toy model the actions of the instantons are large at high t small circumference the classical instanton theory works best at high t the poisson duality relation between these two partition functions eqs and was originally pointed out by dorey and collaborators dorey in this book following ramamurti et al it was explained earlier using the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone monopole instanton duality in qcd toy model of a quantum rotator in fact the poisson duality relation between two sums is in this case exactly the same monopole instanton duality in qcd the authors of ramamurti et al went further performing the poisson ality transformation over the semiclassical sum over twisted instanton dyons the resulting expression for the semiclassical partition function is zinst e n it is periodic in the holonomy as it should be note that unlike in eq it has a modulus rather than a square of the corresponding expression in the exponent this is due to the fact that the sizes of ln and their masses are all dened by the same combination the fourier transform of the t and therefore the moment of inertia using the general poisson relation eq v corresponding function appearing in the sum in eq reads and therefore the monopole partition function is where f e a dx a eiq zmono log where the last equality is for q the resulting partition function can be interpreted as being generated by moving and rotating monopoles the results are a bit surprising first the action of a monopole although still formally large in weak coupling is only a logarithm of the semiclassical parameter these monopoles are therefore quite light second is the issue of monopole rotation the very presence of an object that admits rotational states implies that the monopole core is not spherically symmetric the poisson rewritten partition function has demonstrated that the rotating monopoles are not the rigid rotators because their action eq depends on the angular march wspc book trim size for in in allinone poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions momentum q and is quadratic only for small values of q the slow logarithmic increase of the action with q implies that the dyons are in fact shrinking with increased rotation in the moment of inertia this shrinkage is more important than the growth in the mass as the size appears quadratically as strange as it sounds it reects on the corresponding behavior of the instanton dyons ln with the increasing n although such rotations are well known in principle as julia zee dyons with real electric charge unlike that of the instanton dyons which only exist in the euclidean world and studied in theories with extended supersymmetries to our knowledge the existence of multiple rotational states of monopoles has not yet been explored in monopole based phenomenology in particular one may wonder how the existence of multiple rotational states aects their bose condensation at t tc the basic mechanism behind the deconnement transition the electric charges of the rotating monopoles should therefore also contribute to the jet quenching parameter q and the viscosity which was not yet included in literature fig the normalized monopole density in gauge theory in power t versus shows an apparent linear dependence short summary let me start with the main conclusions of this chapter i monopoles and instanton dyons describe the same physics and duce the same partition function they are just so to say hamiltonian and lagrangian or minkowskian and euclidean ways to describe it one may call it two dual approaches depending on the problem one or the other should be used adding the contributions would be double counting a sin in theoretical physics tc tc t tc thedataarethesamereportedinfig thelineardependenceismanifest march wspc book trim size for in in allinone short summary ii in qcd like theories without adjoint scalars monopoles are not classical objects while it came with some surprise the evidences for that where in front of us for a long time in particular it has been demonstrated rather clearly by dalessandro and delia that monopole density is not decreasing as inverse power of t but only as a power of its log see fig from that paper it is possible only when their action is smono and yet monopoles are poisson dual to instanton dyons whose densities are the inverse powers of t march wspc book trim size for in in allinone poisson duality between the particle monopole and the semiclassical instanton descriptions march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter the qcd ux tubes history the story of qcd ux tubes started in s prior to the discovery of qcd with two important hints at the time experimental discoveries of multiple hadronic states were the main occupation of high energy physics and discovery and tests of avor su metry was the main focus it became obvious that mesons and baryons can not be elementary particles as they were expected to be earlier it was pointed out by hagedorn that rapid growth of density of states should lead to slow growth of temperature in particularly the exponential one th would lead to the ultimate temperature limit of hadronic matter because the partition function z m th t e dm become divergent at t th another line of studies were related to hadron hadron scattering a logical breakthrough was discovery that hadron seems to belong to certain regge trajectories like quantum mechanical bound states in some non relativistic tials it means that there exist some formulae for angular momentum as a function of energy producing energy levels when the values are integer in relativistic tations such expression is written as l furthermore it was shown in many starting with chew and frautschi that the trajectories for mesons and baryons are approximately linear and can be approximated by only two constants for a recent review on regge trajectories of light and heavy mesons see sonnenschein and weissman march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes the dimensionless intercept and the slope the expression works not only for positive t but also for t in scattering for high energies s the cross sections have the following form t t dt in good agreement with the data the largest belongs to the so calledleading trajectory called the p omeron named after pomeranchuck its is above one and therefore all total cross sections grow with s although in a rather slow pace perhaps the most inuential and the most beautiful paper of that period was veneziano which constructed expression for the amplitude based on linearity of the trajectories and possessing a marvelous duality it can be derived either as sum of s channel resonances or t channel regge exchanges in due time it was realized that straight regge trajectories and veneziano plitude indicated that the object under consideration is basically a rotating string this development has lead to important historic point the of the string theory of course the qcd strings are not point like but some complicated gluonic nite size objects with certain properties and structure we are going to discuss in this chapter this was not tolerated by purists among string theorists and a bifurcation happened namely most of them proceeded to study theories of some idealized fundamental pointlike strings not intimidated by the serious obstacles one of them was that for that one needed to quit our dimensional space time and go into much larger number of dimensions fortunately many years later with the advent of ads cft duality it became possible to re unite the two theories together describing the qcd strings as holograms of the pointlike fundamental strings in higher dimensions we will return to this point in section dramatic events of s included not only the discovery of qcd but also experimental discoveries of heavy c quarks and quarkonia states it soon became r and thus apparent that the potential needed to explain them was linear v r the qcd strings got another name the conning ux tubes by the end of s numerical studies of the non abelian elds on the lattice have developed to the point that it was possible creutz to relate the yang mills lagrangian and asymptotic freedom to the string tension the rst time such notion was explicitly demonstrated the same answer followed from two entirely dierent and seemingly unrelated derivations before this work the phenomenologists were inclined to sum these contribution together but veneziano formula elucidated that it was a double counting a birthmark proving the connection note that modern string theorists still call the string scale march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the conning ux tubes on the lattice vs the dual higgs model the conning ux tubes on the lattice vs the dual higgs model permanent connement of color electric charges or connement for short is the most famous non perturbative feature of the gauge theories the lagrangian of qcd like gauge theories is similar to that of qed with massless photons tuted by massless gluons and massive electrons by very light or even massless quarks there are multiple denition of the term itself e the statement that no object with a color charge can appear in physical there is perhaps no need to remind the reader the general setting of the lattice gauge theory or any technical details about it most physicists trust that the limit of vanishing lattice spacing a is taken correctly since starting from the pioneering work creutz it was many times demonstrated that the string tension and other relevant quantities do scale in correspondence with the correct renormalization group prescription and are thus physical what was observed on the lattice for pure gauge theories was that the electric ux from a color charge is not distributed radially outward as in electrodynamics but instead being expelled from the qcd vacuum is conned into a ux tube between the charges at large distances the leading contribution to the static and heavy quark antiquark potential in pure yang mills theory is the famous linear potential t r with t as the fundamental string tension the energy per length its numerical value in qcd with physical quarks is t m ev gev m also as the def inition of absolute units in any conning theory fig displaying the result of lattice simulations summarized in the review bali shows distribution of the electric eld left along the ux tube and magnetic current right in a transverse plane so in numerical simulations of the gauge elds not only the ux tube with the longitudinal electric eld is clearly seen as well as the stabilizing coil around it its physical origin we will discuss later in the chapter in section is a pending million dollar prize oered for a mathematical proof that pure gauge theory has a nite mass gap physicists are already sure that it is the case beyond any reasonable doubt billions of high energy collisions of hadrons and nuclei we already briey discussed above observed produced large number of secondaries and none of them ever was a quark or a gluon the formal limits on that are so small that there is no sense to even mention them recall that in qcd with light quarks this behavior is only valid till some distance due to screening by light quarks in the form of two heavy light mesons so now lattice units are usually set via location of a point at which the potential times the distance take some prescribed value march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes fig lattice data on distribution of the electric eld strength left and the magnetic current right for two static quark antiquark external sources the prole of the electric eld is shown by squares where lines are just ts the dual superconductor idea has been mentioned many times above and need not to be repeated here the specic relation between the qcd ux tubes and their dual ux tubes in superconductors has been pointed out in nielsen and olesen at this point one would like to test whether the duality relation between them is really quantitative more specically let us test whether the shape of the conning ux tubes can indeed be described by the same generic eective model the ginzburg landau as the magnetic ux tubes in superconductors there is no need to describe here the ginzburg landau theory in detail it is enough to say that its expression for the eective free energy analog of the action includes abelian qed gauge eld and a charged scalar described by complex eld representing condensate of cooper the key maxwell equation we will focus on it tells us that abrikosov ux tube solution with nonzero magnetic eld b inside the tube and zero outside needs a coil with current conning the eld inside the current is the gradient of the scalar phase in the dual case we discuss one should substitute me remind that when ginzburg landau paper was written the physical nature of electric object which makes the condensate was also unknown they argues for the form of eective action on general grounds was an instructive story about the charge of the gl paper was written well before the microscopic bcs theory of superconductivity ginzburg initially put some eective charge eef but landau objected saying that if the charge be dependent on matter parameters like temperature it would spoil gauge invariance of electrodynamics and so they put e the electron charge after bcs it became clear that the charge must indeed be xed but not to one but reminder we are looking for a static solutions only so time derivative of in it is omitted march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the conning ux tubes on the lattice vs the dual higgs model left transverse prole of the electric eld and the condensate right the transverse fig distribution of the magnetic current the points in both are lattice data and the lines are ts using abrikosov s ux tube solution of the ginzburg landau equations and representing the magnetically charged monopole condensate the curl of e is shown in fig coincides well with the separately sured magnetic current from monopole motion so at least the second equation basically dual maxwell equation is indeed satised with some accuracy also the rst equation is satised and shown in fig is the radial prole of the condensate observed on the lattice note in particular that like in the perconductors the dual higgs scalar eld vanishes at the center the resulting parameters for two basic lengths in physical units obtained xing lattice scale to physical are m m recall that the so called ginzburg landau ratio of them is smaller than the critical value shown at the end of the previous equation this implies that the qcd vacuum we live in is the dual superconductor of type i rather extensive calculations of the static potential at large and also nite r were performed in the framework of the dual higgs model see review baker et al we will not reproduce here the results but just provide few comments comment in this and subsequent works not only the static classical linear potential is described but also the velocity dependent relativistic corrections mately rather successfully compared to phenomenological relativistic terms derived from the quarkonia spectra later baker and collaborators had also calculated the regge trajectories see baker and steinke those who are not convinced by not too impressive accuracy of this numerical statement may wander if there are more direct manifestation of it we will return to the issue of ux tube interaction in section on multi string systems march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes comment generally speaking the dual higgs models constitute quite teresting examples of an eective magnetic theory approach not only the scalar elds in them are magnetically charged describing the bec of monopoles but the gauge eld itself is also treated using the dual potential rather than the usual a a specic form of the model is motivated and dened in baker et al as an example of further progress in lattice technology let me mention ihara et al in which the ux tube has been studied from the point of view of the underlying stress tensor the qcd operator of the stress tensor is of course well known but for many years its direct evaluation has been blocked by very large statistical noise in the paper under consideration the authors used the gradient ow smoothening procedure appended by additional extrapolation back to zero value of the gradient ow time the authors have demonstrated that the procedure t is consistent with lattice studies of the equation of state for example their t agrees with the energy density needless to say in order to study the properties of the ux tube one needs sucient statistical precision to subtract these mean values present everywhere in fig from this work one can see transverse distribution of the diagonal components of the stress tensor note that the sign of them as shown are selected in such a way that in pure electric eld all four would be the same this apparently this is not the case yet two transverse pressures the rr and components seem to be always the same agrees with pressure one other comment is that the energy density at the center of the ux tube as read from gs and c is about gev this is very large value in particular it is about two orders of magnitude larger than the value suggested by the early mit bag model of s which tried to describe ux tube compressed by some bag pressure in those days the magnitude of non perturbative eect were grossly underestimated fig mid plane distribution

trajectories and rotating strings regge trajectories and rotating strings static potentials are not the only place where one can infer existence of the damental ux tubes another impressive conrmation comes from hadronic troscopy quarkonia the non relativistic bound state of heavy quark antiquarks are indeed well described by the sum of coulomb and linear potential hadrons made of light quarks also show a very spectacular conrmation to the idea that mesons are basically quark antiquarks connected by a ux tube and at least some baryons can be approximated by similar quark diquark systems also connected by a ux tube fig various types of reggeons rotating qq pair held by a string rotating gluon pair positive c parity held by two strings c three gluons negative c parity objects held by three strings rotating baryon junctions held by nc strings quantization of such system with a string predicts that such hadrons should appear in form of regge trajectories as it was noticed in s excited states of light mesons and baryons are indeed located on near linear trajectories in the total angular momentum j squared mass m let me not present historic chu frautchi plot but go into relatively recent fig from sonnenschein and weissman in which there are many states and also lines indicating the model we will be discussing for future reference let me note that all vector trajectories at m go to furthermore even the hadrons without quarks the glueballs can be described in terms of rotating closed strings forming another set of regge trajectories the lattice data on spectrosopy of pure gauge theories have in my view produced rather signiant support to this statement since it is much less known and will be needed in connection to pomerons we will discuss later in this chapter let us see them following kharzeev et al the corresponding plot for the masses of glueball with positive charge c parity taken from the lattice study meyer completeness let me mention that slope is universal

should be doubled two strings rather than one or that the slope of c even glueballs regge trajectories should be a half of that in mesons yet as seen and the glueball slope calculated from these plots the mesonic gev so this ratio is rather than what from and is gev it implies is that the two strings must not be independent but interacting with each plot one again nds that in three pairs the slope

junction reggeon nobody proposed any name for it so far with unknown to me intercept and the slope close to of the usual one i am not aware of any resonance or state attributed to this trajectory in summary conning fundamental ux tubes have been seen and studied on the lattice and they also have strong support via hadronic spectroscopy and reactions their properties are in agreement with predictions based on the dual higgs models flux tubes and nite temperatures the role of monopoles in this section we extend our discussion of the ux tubes to qcd at nite tures a general expectation based on analogy to superconductors is that they exist in the conning phase t tc and disappear above it however as we will paragraph is based on kharzeev and recent private communication from d kharzeev who is working on so far unpublished paper on this issue march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes see shortly the situation turned out to be posessing unexpected and rather peculiar features not present in the case of superconductors at nite temperatures the natural quantity to calculate for the observed ux tubes between static charges is the free energy it can be written as f r t v r t t t t f r t where t is the entropy associated with the pair of static quarks since it can be calculated from the free energy itself as indicated in the r s one can subtract it and plot also the potential energy v r the derivatives over r of both potentials the force is what we call the string tension the lattice calculations have shown that in certain range of r the tension is constant the potential is approximately linear in r we do not show this but ceed directly to the temperature dependence of the two resulting tensions shown in fig based on lattice calculations by the bielefeld bnl group see marek and zantow and earlier works mentioned there the tension of the free energy shows the expected behavior f t vanishes as t tc but the tension of the potential energy v t shows drastically dierent behavior with large maximum at tc and non zero value above it this unexpected behavior was hidden in f t studied in many previous works because in it a large energy and a large entropy cancel each other the explanation to this eect has been proposed by liao and shuryak which we will here follow but before we follow this particular explanation related with monopoles let us make some general comments comment a large entropy implies exponentially large exp number of states associated with static quark pair furthermore the nonzero tension derivative over r mean that such states are not concentrated at the string s end but are also distributed along the string what can the physical origin of those states be r comment a nonzero tension v r at t tc implies the existence of ux tubes above tc comment the ree energy by its nature corresponds to physical conditions of complete thermal equilibrium which can only be reached at long time if the time is limited for example if color dipole is only created for a nite time or in other situations with moving non static charges there would be deviations from equilibrium and therefore cancellations between energy and entropy may be only partial comment therefore the eective potentials for quarkonia which have relativistic but still non static heavy quarks should be somewhat intermediate tween f r and v r liao and shuryak discussed a setting in which heavy quark and antiquark slowly move away from each other with some velocity v and argue that the entropy production can be calculated using landau zener theory of level crossings used originally for description of bi atomic molecules this theory march wspc book trim size for in in allinone flux tubes and nite temperatures the role of monopoles describes how the resulting population of both crossed levels depends on v now let us proceed to the dynamical explanation proposed by liao and shuryak its main point is that the dual superconductor picture is not sucient one should also recognize the existence of uncondenced or normal of the monopole density liao and myself argued liao and shuryak that electric ux tubes can be mechanically stable even without the dual superconductor or bec of monopoles indeed presence of magnetic ux tubes in various plasmas are well known the dierence between such ux tubes at t tc and the one due to dual superconductor at t tc is that in the latter case the coil includes dissipative supercurrent making them permanently stable while the latter ones have ohmic losses and are therefore metastable fig left free red rhombs energy f r and potential blue squares energy v r at tc compared to the zero temperature potential black line right eective string tension for the free and the internal energy using elliptic coordinates liao and shuryak had derived a solution for the electric eld in the monopole plasma even for nite distance between the quark charges reproducing the potential from coulomb like behavior at small distances to long ux tubes at large we will not give any details here and only note that because at high t the monopole density drops rapidly at t and thus the metastable ux tubes do not exist there finally let me add some comments about more recent lattice study of the ux tubes at nite temperature cea et al using certain smoothening procedure that in the bcs superconductors there are no uncondences cooper pairs in fact in a good telescope one can directly see hundreds of them in solar corona bunches of ux tubes compose the black spots on the sun made famous by observations by galileo who used them to discover solar rotation the pope of the time interpreted black spots on the sun as allegory criticizing him personally and initiated trials ended in galileo home arrests march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes the shape of the longitudinal electric eld as a function of transverse coordinate is measured for a number of temperatures for pure gauge su theory and for qcd with realistic quark masses in fig we show some of their results note that this theory has the rst order transition seen as a jump in the eld strength and yet the overall ux tube shape persists in the pictures of the electric eld approximately till t these observations support the idea that the ux tubes do exists in the qgp in spite of absence of the the dual superconductor there fig the longitudinal electric eld as a function of transverse coordinate is measured for a number of temperatures for pure gauge su theory from cea et al eective string theory est versus precise lattice data this section starts with a pedagogical introduction introducing classical string solutions and explaining elements of string quantization and then jumps to a brief review of the current status of est in connection with empirical and lattice data a particle moving in d space time dimensions can be described by its path x with proper time and d similarly a string moving in d time dimensions is described by coordinates x with two internal coordinates time like and space like the simplest geometrical nambu goto action is simply march wspc book trim size for in in allinone eective string theory est versus precise lattice data the area of the corresponding membrane times the tension sn g t d h h x x where is called the external metric assumed for now just at minkowski metric beta is the internal metric of worldsheet the area element include the determinant of it h we will also use a dot for derivative in x x if the endpoints are massive the and a prime for derivative in e following particle term is added to the action sends m d x for simplicity we assume both masses to be the same m classical equation of motion for the string is and the boundary conditions should be hhx t hx m x x it may look complicated but we will not study complicated string dynamics the most straightforward rotating string conguration is given by x x x solves the string equation of motion the boundary condition takes the form t which has the obvious meaning l is half of string length using standard noether procedure to calculate the energy and angular momentum and substituting this solution into them one gets using simpler notation v integrals one gets the following rather intuitive results l the velocity of the string ends and performing the e m t j t l l l d l e m l v march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes j t the length can be substituted from the boundary condition t l and one has the resulting regge trajectory in a parametric form how well it describes the mesons one can see in sonnenschein and weissman let us just mention the case of light quarks small m and v close to expanding the function in the r s one has then the linear regge trajectory with corrections j m e where we also use the standard relation between the string tension t and the regge slope is quantization of the problem must include not only quantum motion of masses but also that of the string and it is not simple at people obviously did rst the case in which string ends are xed for the nambu goto action one can solve this problem and obtain string energy including quantum string vibrations arvis t r t which appends the classical linear potential by a quantum factor close to one at large r but generating certain expansion in powers of t for regge trajectories transition from classical to quantum results are more involved in general but for massless endpoints it can be done by the following additive substitution j j n a where n is the quantum number for radial excitations and a is the quantum addition to the intercept note how elegantly two quantum numbers for orbital and radial excitations j and n appear together in a chew frautschi plot various integer values of n generate daughter trajectories which are simply shifted downward from the parents by one or more units we will not discuss them but string quantization is a complicated topic going well beyond this course unless one deals with the so called critical dimension of space time d for bosonic string certain anomalies appear their cancellation is possible via complicated addition to string lagrangian to my knowledge it is not important issue for stationary string but appear e for rotating one dealed with by sonnenshein and collaborators for stringy pomeron solution to be discussed below it is not yet resolved to my knowledge hellerman and swanson it was shown using very general assumptions that for massless endpoints a march wspc book trim size for in in allinone eective string theory est versus precise lattice data just mention that those predict correctly certain observed mesons and baryons as well as a parting comment let us note that masses at the string ends can be viewed holographically as just extra piece of a string reaching in the th dimension to the avor brane for a review on holography inspired stringy hadrons see nenschein now we have completed the pedagogical part introducing stringy potentials and regge trajectories in their simplest form now we will address much more dicult questions related with real life qcd strings those are complicated extended jects and one has no general reasons to assume that they simply follow nambu goto geometric action twisting of a string may cause extra energy therefore higher der terms may appear in the eective string action let us briey summarize what is known about them at this time long strings are described uniquely by the expanded form of the nambu goto action s t x ixi the integration is over the world volume of the string m with embedded coordinates x i in d dimensions the rst contribution is the area of the world sheet and the second contribution captures the uctuations of the world sheet in leading order in the derivatives since the qcd string is extended and therefore not fundamental its tion in terms of an action is eective in the generic sense organized in increasing derivative contributions each with new coecients these contributions are ically split into bulk m and boundary m terms the former add pairs of tives to the polyakov action the rst of such contribution in the gauge xed as in was proposed by polyakov polyakov x x x x x x which is seen to be conformal with the dimensionless extrinsic curvature higher derivative contributions are restricted by lorentz rotational in euclidean time symmetry the boundary contributions are also restricted by symmetry the ing contribution is a constant plus higher derivatives we will only consider the so called contribution with specically sb all the terms in contribute to the static potential the rst contribution stems from the string vibrations as described in the quadratic term march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes t r t it is luscher universal term with in dimensions using string alities luscher and weisz have shown that also the next two terms are universal true for any string action t r t t note that these contributions are the two terms of quantum string contributions summed arvis mentioned above so they also follow from the nambu goto action as of course they should but the next terms can be modied for further discussion of the static q q potential stemming from the est we refer to aharony and klinghoer summarizing quantum and boundary corrections to the potential at large r to order has the form v r t r d d the third and fourth contributions in are luscher and luscher weisz versal terms in arbitrary dimensions both reproduced by expanding arvis tial see petrov and ryutin for a related discussion of the role of luscher terms in the pomeron structure the last contribution is induced by the dependent string boundary contribution comment even if the string ends are constant in external space they still may depend on the dimensional coordinates on the worldvolume of a vibrating string comment the number of transverse dimensions d is if string vibrations occur in the usual d space time however in holography d d an extra vibration can be physically viewed as radial string excitation as we will discuss in section d comment the term receives both perturbative and non perturbative contributions the former are uv sensitive and in dimensional regularization renormalize to zero as we assume throughout the latter are not accounted for in the conformal nambu goto string but arise from the extrinsic curvature term in the form hidaka and pisarski qian and zahed foo d march wspc book trim size for in in allinone eective string theory est versus precise lattice data note that this contribution amounts to a negative boundary mass term in and vanishes for d spacetime dimensions in the holographic ads qcd approach it is nite for d we will not discuss the extensive holographic studies of the est and related potential aharony and klinghoer but proceed to lattice simulations of the heavy quark potential these studies have now reached a high degree of precision shedding light on the relevance and limitation of the string description in a recent investigation by brandt brandt considerable accuracy was obtained for the potential at zero temperature and for pure gauge and theories as can be seen from fig in brandt the inter quark potential is described to an accuracy of one per mille clearly showing that both luscher s universal terms r are correctly reproduced by the numerical simulations indeed for r or r fm for sommer s parameter fm these two contributions describe the potential extremely well expanding further to order or keeping the complete square root in arvis potential would not improve the agreement with the lattice potential since the measured potential turns up and opposite to the expansion brandt lattice tions brandt have convincingly demonstrated that the next correction is of order with the opposite sign the extracted contribution xes the coecient in as with the numerically tted values bsu bsu t t for the details and explanation regarding the procedure and meaning of the errors we refer to brandt note that the overall contribution of this term to the potential is positive in summary according to modern lattice studies at r fm the static potential contains a wiggle visible however only with a good magnifying above this point est describes the glass since its relative magnitude is potential accurately with terms of the expansion dened applications of qcd strings in general and est in particular include not only i the static potential the wilson loop but via certain duality transformation also two more important applications ii the correlator of two polyakov lines at nite temperatures iii the stringy pomeron or the tube like stringy instanton describing amplitude of the elastic hadron hadron scattering at high energies march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes basically all three applications stem from description of a rectangular piece of stringy membrane therefore any progress in understanding of i thus induces some progress in ii and as well we will briey describe those for iii following kharzeev et al in the next section the stringy pomeron let us start this section with a general motivation explaining why i decided go into the subject of hadron scattering and pomerons in spite of its apparent complexity basically there are two motivations one is that hadronic scattering amplitudes depend on properties of qcd strings exponentially at large impact parameter b exceeding the r m s hadronic sizes the stringy conguration produced must be virtual instanton like so that the amplitude has a tunneling form it is indeed conrmed by the experimental data at large b furthermore exp the experimentally observed peripheral collisions b as large as m which means there are string lengths larger than what we study in quarkonia or regions the second motivation is that put in the exponent even relatively small quantum corrections can be seen more clearly exp scl one of the specic important issues of the eld is whether one would be able to locate a transition between the perturbative regime at small b and stringy one at large b we have shown above that in static potentials the transition is now detected similar study is badly needed as a funciton of t or b the pomeron can be dened as the non positive t zero or negative zero mass squared object located at the leading highest regge trajectory it has the vacuum quantum number which means is transfered from one beam to another the universal behavior of all hadronic elastic amplitudes in fig we already presented current data on the glueball at large s spectroscopy and located this trajectory containing j lowest mass states phenomenologically the pomeron intercept the regge calculus with reggeon exchange diagrams have been created in phenomenologically in s mostly by pomeranchuck gribov and veneziano with the development of pqcd it has been derived from resummation of ladder diagrams descibing multiple production of gluons the so called bfkl pomeron very small scattering angles or t electromagnetic coulomb forces dominate the strong actions reactions like pn np regge trajectory with e the pion has isospin and thus can be studied via isospin transfer high sensitivity to the pomeron parameters can be illustrated by the fact that that this small deviation from is the reason why all cross section slowly grow with s this small eect is in fact responsible for about doubled n n cross section between the collision energies used in s and today march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the stringy pomeron kuraev et al collects collinear logarithms and produce power of s known as the bfkl pomeron intersept ln the pomeron slope as dimensional quantity can not of course occur in pqcd there is ongoing debate about both the experimental observation of the eron the c odd exchange which would make a dierence between the pp and pp elastic amplitudes and the pqcd predictions for its trajectory it is supposed to be calculated from the bound state of three reggeized gluons some studies put its intercept at some exactly at let us now introduce the semi classical stringy pomeron it originates from the paper basar et al and thus will be called the bkyz pomeron using the instanton method and stringy lagrangian these authors had calculated the forward scattering amplitude between two small dipoles relativistically moving relative to each other in order to explain the stringy pomeron let me rst take a detour and consider related classic problem of the e e pair production in constant electric eld it is widely known as the schwinger process as he solved it in detail in s however we will not discuss neither the schwinger paper nor even earlier heisenberg euler paper but much earlier semiclassical work sauter from well before anyone else the eom of a charge relativistically moving in constant electric eld is a classic problem which everybody had encounter in e m classes writing it in a form one nds the solution dp dt dt v ee m a at a check small and large time limits transformation into euclidean time it of the trajectory yields a and a it describes the euclidean path in shape of the and between semicircle this should not surprise us in euclidean world time is no dierent from other coordinates and electric eld is no dierent from the magnetic ones so in the plane the paths are circles like they are in all other planes the physical meaning of the semicircle is as follows it describes tunneling through the mass gap in the spectrum of states there are no states between with real momentum p but on the euclidean e path we found the momentum is imaginary and e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes fig the dipole dipole scattering due to closed string exchange the impact parameter dipole paths is the transverse distance between two colliding dipoles reclined by angles will become colliding after the result is transferred to minkowski kinematics via iy where y is relative rapidity calculating the action s eexdt one gets the euclidean version of it for the semicircle se the semiclassical probability square of the amplitude of the pair production is then mds e p e ee in qcd problem we want to solve there are two colliding dipoles each having a ux tube in between two charges if each of them produces qq pair one notice that quarks are under constant tension force so the problem is analogous to that just considered the probability to create two quark pair and split each dipole into two would corresponds to trajectories of quarks making two circles on the worldsheet of each dipole now imagine that instead of production of massive quarks we would like to think of purely stringy process in which two circular holes on the worldsheets get connected by some tube like conguration connecting the worldsheets of two dipoles the setting is sketched in fig such stringy object with minimal euclidean action area times the tension is the stringy instanton describing neling between two colliding dipole worldsheets the semiclassical probability of it to happen in the forward scattering amplitude will give us the stringy pomeron some introduction to the formal setting of bkyz paper is perhaps needed the starting expression is t q i w march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the stringy pomeron where q loop for a dipole is the momentum transfer is impact parameter and w is the wilson w t r p nc for clarity the authors start in perturbation theory and calculate this amplitude due to two gluon exchange t n c c ga b with a being the dipole size minkowski analytic continuation is done via iy where y is relative rapidity of the dipoles note that the scattering prole its b dependence is power like and can be obtained just by dimensional argument pqcd lacking any dimensionful quantities can not give anything else the eective string theory has a parameter t which as we will see will appear in the action and then in the scattering prole the classical solution itself is obtained with simplied polyakov form of the action s t t d d x x x x the length of the tube is obviously the impact parameter between the two dipoles protons b assumed to be large the circumference of the tube is where the quantity in denominator represents the collision energy s is the mandelstam invariant related to the collision energy can also be viewed as the rapidity dierence between the two colliding beams the product b is the tube area which times the string tension t gives the action of stringy instanton presumed large for semiclassical setting to be valid one can map the two problems static potential and the pomeron to each other as discussed in the appendix of shuryak and zahed it is done via some duality relation by exchanging time and space one also needs to add another mirror image of a potential to match the boundary conditions which explains appearance of factor below in this case the two partition functions of the string and its excitations become identical the explicit transformation is assuming the correspondence between the potential and the pomeron is exact we can map the potential onto the pomeron scattering amplitude in in impact parameter space as t b k e a march wspc book trim size for in in allinone with the qcd ux tubes b d d with t and now we can recall the parameters of the tube and set following this substitution one observes that the leading and subleading terms have very dierent roles and energy dependence the leading two contributions p e give the pomeron form of the amplitude with the intercept value d the gaussian dependence on b is consequence of the famous gribov diusion derived originally in perturbative setting due to random emission of gluons in ladder diagrams in fact strings also follow the same diusive law ln s which exists equally for perturbative gluons and strings furthermore one should recognize that the stringy pomeron approach exists in two versions the at space and the holographic ones in the former case the space has two at transverse directions d while in the latter the string also propagates in the third and curved dimension since gribov diusion also takes place along this coordinate identied with the scale of the incoming dipoles the expressions we will use are a bit modied from the standard expressions one such eect derived for the the bkyz pomeron is the modication of the pomeron intercept due to extra dimension d d and is the t hooft coupling assumed to be large in the is in the range for the numerical analyses p here d range of to follow we will use for the pomeron intercept the value this happens to be not far from the at space value of experimentally the pomeron scattering amplitude exibits both a real and inary part the real part can in fact be measured at two locations i at small t by observing the interference with the electromagnetic ing induced by a photon exchange at the location of the diractive node tnode where the imaginary part vanishes and the subleading real part gets visible for march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the stringy pomeron the interference measurement the results are expressed in terms of the so called parameter re i m a a s t s t the totem data antchev et al give tev tev the parameter with the signature factor which for small t is captured by the phase the textbook description of factor eip it is small if p is small in agreement with data the regge scattering amplitudes relates a real part of the amplitude may appear in reggeon calculus because the pomeron can be exchange both is s and cross channel u in the euclidean culation of the scattering amplitude one needs to include two contributions with both the euclidean angle as well as representing the u channel the sulting amplitude after analytic continuation to minkowski space and the transforming from the impact parameter to momentum transfer t has the form the main information we have about the prole of the scattering amplitude can be summarized as follows one observable is the total cross sectionwith few datapoints shown in the upper plot of fig another important parameter is the so called slope of the elastic scattering amplitude b dlne t the corresponding data are shown in the right plot of fig both grow with the collision energy due to the eective growth of the proton size induced by gribov diusion process our last comment is that there is a serious problem with the description via pomerons of the pp collisions at lhc energies at small enough bbd the protons basically are black discs with probability of scattering very close to unity obviously any structure in the amplitude inside the black disc is unobservable one can model it with multi pomeron expressions and unitarization of the amplitude but inherently there is no accuracy at small b the only information remaining is the large b or small t slope we discussed above to go around this diculty one can hope to get data on p collisions from the future electron ion collider the photon coupling to pomeron is small and no multi pomeron processes will be needed march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes fig the upper plot shows tot in mb versus the log of the collision energy the left side low energy data points at s gev are from the old isr measurements and the three right side points for s tev are from the totem measurements the dotted line in the lower plot indicates the contribution of the reggeons other than the pomeron from the pdg t the right plot shows the elastic slope b the curves are for model proles discussed in our paper interaction of qcd strings lattice ads qcd and ments in the dual superconductor approach the electric ux tubes are treated as dual to abrikosov s solution for magnetic ux tubes in semiconductors depending on the ratio of the two lengths of the problem associated with the gauge eld and higgs eld masses their interaction at large distances can be attractive or repulsive for superconductors this generates type i and type ii superconductors we already discussed above that qcd vacuum is of the type i which means that qcd strings should attract each other at large distances obviously one can arrange lattice conguration with four static charges and two strings and study their mutual interaction and indeed for pure gauge theories their mutual attraction has been conrmed however the situation is dierent for pure gauge theories and qcd with the light quarks in the former case the lightest hadron is the scalar glueball with a mass of about gev therefore the interactions can only be very short range in the real world qcd the lightest mesons are pions of mass m gev gev and and its scalar chiral partner meson with a mass of about m therefore much longer range string string interactions are possible the pion is exp march wspc book trim size for in in allinone interaction of qcd strings lattice ads qcd and experiments isovector and can not be emitted by pure glue state so we are left with in order to understand how qcd vacuum is modied around a string one can perform lattice studies measuring vevs of various operators around it for sigma meson the operator is the isoscalar scalar quark density in fig the normalized to vacuum value of this vev is shown as a function of transverse distance from the string in lattice units from iritani et al note that all deviations from the vacuum value of the quark condensate is indeed small as it is expected to be suppressed by n even at the string center the suppression eect is only about or so fig the normalized chiral condensate perturbed by a ux tube as a funciton of the coordinate transverse to the tube the lattice data are from iritani et al the curve is a t with the sigma meson propagator described in the text the curve at this plot is from kalaydzhyan and shuryak it is a t to the lattice data by the expression w w where the regulated transverse distance is dened by string the spatial is bessel function corresponding to massive scalar propagator in d dimensions normal to the string the t parameters used are c sstring x to n n nuclear forces suggest that one needs to include the isoscalar vector meson as well as its repulsive force nearly cancel the attractive sigma term in the application discuss below we have all kind of string pairs string string and string antistrings with equal probability so one may think in this case the sign changing vector exchange averages out to zero yet in case of a pomeron or glueball reggeons or the baryon junction reggeon we have strong antistring or three strings respectively perhaps in this case the omega meson exchanges need to be included march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes m m m ev in the string string interaction the following less parameter enters gn t which is of the order of few percents thus one nds string ensembles subject to scalar eective the nal topic in this section devoted to ux tube interactions is its mental aspect in fact producing a single string is hardly possible the color eld ux needs to be returned we have already mentioned that because the pomeron can be viewed either as an exchange of a closed string or production of two strings connecting the colliding hadrons thus the minimal number of produced strings is two but there are occasions in which many more strings are completing the subject of qcd string string interactions let us briey discuss what such interactions imply for multi string systems collective interaction of an ensemble of strings were studied by kalaydzhyan and shuryak using the sigma exchange in d space time and in holographic setting later in both of them the strings were assumed to be stretched in the same longitudinal direction as it is the case in not too early time in high energy collisions we call congurations with many parallel strings a spaghetti state so classical string dynamics is restricted to motion the transverse or space in which strings are just points the simulations are molecular dynamics md or simply solving classical equation of motion of the strings in fig we show an example of snapshots at subsequent time as one can see the central part of the multi string system undergoes clustering resembling the gravitational collapse for each conguration one can calculate the value of the quark condensate modied according to collective inuence of all strings typically it rapidly develop regions in which such suppression is about complete what it means is that there is chiral another theoretical approach in which string interactions can be studied is based on holographic supersymmetric models originating from the ads cft correspondence of the conformal dimensional space time we put some gluodynamics to string theory in tary introduction to it in appendix since these models start with string theories with d superstrings the strings are natural point like objects in the bulk their ends lead naturally to fundamental charges on the boundary that is in the d manifold where the gauge theory and ourselves are located while the string shape in curved space is not so simple its total energy static potential is v r r indeed it is obvious by dimension because conformal theories lack any dimensional parameters the original ads cft correspondence has been eralized to some bottom up holographic models collectively known as ads qcd for a review see gursoy and kiritsis n for example when a proton ies through a diameter of a heavy nucleus the mean number of if so one needs to deal protons it interacts with at lhc energies is about nan n with at minimum strings in such central pa events this number of course returns to two strings or a single pomeron for very peripheral pa collisions the open question is at which impact parameters one has to describe the system as a set of strings and at which all strings get collectivized into a common qgp reball march wspc book trim size for in in allinone string balls symmetry restoration at the center of the system or that multi string systems rapidly create a qgp reball fig snapshots of multi string conguration evolution in time at t m c the string locations in fm in the transverse plane are shown by stars they are assumed to be all strenched in the same longitudinal direction not shown string balls historically studies of the self interacting string balls started in the framework of fundamental string theory in critical dimensions for bosonic strings the theoretical questions discussed were related to the understanding of the transition from the free strings via string balls to black holes the main question relevant for this transition is very simple as we discussed in the previous section the interaction between qcd strings is weak and the same weak coupling regime is believed to hold for fundamental so for a short string the selnteraction is negligible a very large string or in fact any large object if described by gravity which grows with mass more than any other action is subject to gravitational collapse therefore gravity becomes a dominant force and suciently massive strings should be black holes of the classical ity these two limits are obvious the main idea is that at some intermediate mass range the gravity and other forces can be balanced producing stable gravitationally bound let us start with free strings a random walk process of m ms steps where if so the string is the typical mass of a straight string segment ms entropy scales as the number of segments sball m ms remind that massless modes of closed strings include gravitons therefore it is a candidate for the theory of quantum gravity for example stars and gaseous planets exist due to balance between thermal pressure and gravity march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes the schwarzschild radius of a black hole in d spatial dimensions is and the bekenstein entropy rbh m sbh area m thus the equality sball sbh can only be reached at some special critical mass mc when this happens the hawking temperature of the black hole is exactly the string hagedorn value th and the radius is at the string scale so at least at such value of the mass a near critical string ball can be identied at least thermodynamically with a black hole however in order to understand how exactly this state is reached one should rst address the following puzzle considering a free string ball described by the polyakov s near critical random walk one would estimate its radius to be rball r m for any dimension d this answer does not t the schwarzschild radius rbh given above the important element missing is the self interaction of the string ball perhaps susskind was the rst who pointed it out a more quantitative study horowitz and polchinski had used the mean eld approach and then damour and veneziano completed the argument by using the correction to the ball s mass due to the self interaction their reasoning can be nicely summarized by the following schematic expression for the entropy of a self interacting string ball of radius r and mass m r m m m rd where all numerical constants are for brevity suppressed and all dimensional tities are in string units given by its tension the coupling g in the last bracket is the string self coupling constant to be much discussed below for a very weak coupling the last term in the last bracket can be ignored and the entropy maximum will be given by the rst two terms this brings us back to the random walk string ball however even for a very small g the importance of the last term depends not on g but on m so very massive balls can be inuenced by a very weak gravity what indeed happens with planets and stars if the last term is large compared to the self interacting string balls become much smaller in size and eventually t the schwarzschild radius let us now switch back to qcd strings in the preceding section their long range interaction has been ascribed to meson exchanges we also have demonstrated there that a suciently dense multi string states can collapse in this case into march wspc book trim size for in in allinone string balls a qgp reball now we wander if this attractive force can be balanced by tropy leading to some stable congurations at some intermediate parameters of the problem the numerical model we use to study the string balls with self interaction while we discuss the details of the setting below in this section let us emphasize on the onset its main physics prerequisites namely that the ball surface should be approximately near the hagedorn temperature making the string uctuate widely outward the string string interaction established in the previous section is in the vacuum t while the string balls we are discussing are expected to be produced at t tc therefore the eective meson mass is expected to be reduced in fact to zero in qcd with strictly massless quarks following a bit wilson s strong coupling expansion we place the strings on links of a lattice strings are assumed to be in contact with a heat bath and a partition function includes all possible string congurations intersections of the strings are not included because of the repulsive interaction at small distances even for the abelian elds which add up simply as vectors the action is quadratic in elds no commutators and intersections are energetically not favorable an exception in the lattice geometry is the case of exactly oppositely directed uxes when a part of the string should basically disappear we had not included this complication believing that the total entropy and energy of the string ball will not be aected much instead of using boxes with or without periodic boundary conditions as is customary in the lattice gauge theory and many other statistical applications we opted for an innite space no box instead the temperature t is space dependent we think it better corresponds to the experimental situation furthermore the string ball surface is automatically near criticality and thus strongly uctuating this aspect will be important for our application of initial deformations below the physical units in gluodynamics as in lattice tradition are set by putting the string tension to its value in the real world t gev numerical lattice simulations have shown that gluodynamics with nc has a rst order deconnement phase transition with very weakly dependent on nc for review see e refs teper numerically the critical temperature of the gluodynamics is tc it has been further shown that the eective string tension of the ree energy f t decreases with t a point where it vanishes is known as the hagedorn point since this point is above tc some attempts have been made bringoltz and teper to get closer to it by superheating the hadronic phase yet some amount of extrapolation is still needed the resulting value was found to be mev th tc the nature of the lattice model we use is very dierent from that of the lattice march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes gauge theory lgt first of all we do not want to study quantum strings and erate two dimensional surfaces in the matsubara space restricting ourselves to the thermodynamics of strings in d spatial dimensions the lattice spacing a in lgt is a technical cuto which at the end of the calculation is expected to be extrapolated to zero reaching the so called continuum limit in our case a is a physical parameter characterizing qcd strings its value is selected from the requirement that it determines the correct density of states directions from each since we postulate that the string can go to any of a possible strings point going backward on itself is prohibited we have of length l our partition function is given by z dl exp l a t l t and hence the hagedorn divergence happens at th t a setting th gev according to the lattice data mentioned above and the string tension we x the three dimensional spacing to be gev m it is therefore a much more coarse lattice compared to the ones usually used in lgt if no external charges are involved the excitations are closed strings at low t one may expect to excite only the smallest ones with the no self crossing rule we apply that would be an elementary plaquette with four links its mass eplaquette a gev is amusingly in the ballpark of the lowest glueball masses of qcd for completeness the lowest meson is one link or mass gev and the lowest baryon is three links gev of string energy plus that of the baryon junction at temperatures below and not close to th one nds extremely dilute gas of glueballs or straight initial strings we put in only close to th do multiple string states get excited the strings rapidly grow and start occupying a larger and larger fraction of the available space e o before we show the results of the simulation let us discuss the opposite dense limit of our model we do not allow strings to overlap the minimal distance between them is one link length or again about m is it large enough for the string to be considered well separated we think so as it is about three times the string radius the most compact or hamiltonian string wrapping visits each site of the lattice if the string is closed then the number of occupied links is the same as the number of occupied sites since in d each site is shared among march wspc book trim size for in in allinone string balls fig left plot the mean energy of the cluster vs the mean length of the string lower plot the mean energy of the cluster vs the newton coupling gn gev points show the results of the simulations in setting gev and size of the ball st for circles and stars respectively eight neighboring cubes there is eectively only one occupied link per unit cube and this wrapping produces the maximal energy density we normalized it to a power of tc the highest temperature of the hadronic phase it is instructive to compare it to the energy density of the gluonic plasma for which we use the free stefan boltzmann value t c t a t t n c and conclude that our model s maximal energy density is comparable to the physical maximal energy density of the mixed phase we would like to study the algorithm consists of a sequence of updates for the each string segment such that the conguration gradually approaches equilibrium the spatial distribution over all three coordinates is close to the gaussian one as is exemplied in the upper gure yet it is not just a gaussian ensemble of random points as the points constitute extended objects strings in fig left gure we show the calculated relation between the average string length l and its energy e each point is a run of about iterations of the entire string updates after equilibration while at small coupling e and l are simply proportional to each other like for noninteracting strings described above this behavior changes abruptly as the negative self interaction energy become important the total energy e of the ball becomes decreasing with the string length l in fig right gure we show more details of this behavior this plot demonstrates how total energy e depends on the coupling value gn we nd a jump at the critical coupling for this setting n which in a simulation looks like a rst order transition with double maxima distributions in the energy and length as is seen from the gure the precise value of the coupling somewhat depends on march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes fig color online a typical conguration in the entropy rich self balanced string balls ensemble simulation parameters gev st gn gev the system size at this coupling the jump in energy is always about a factor and the jump in string length or entropy is even larger in this way we observe a new regime for our system which we will call the entropy rich self balanced string balls for a given xed mass m we thus nd that string balls may belong to two very distinct classes i small near random balls and large ones in which the string can be very long but balances its tension by a comparable collective attraction discovery of this second regime is the main result of this paper the total energy is only e an example of a corresponding conguration is shown in fig note that in spite of a very large string length l a gev as a result of the balancing between the mass and self interaction note furthermore that that congurations are very asymmetric one string is excited much more than the other since the longer string has many more states than the shorter one the same feature has been noticed on the lattice as well typically one very long string forms a large cluster dominating over a few small clusters note further that nearly all space inside the ball with t th is occupied high entropy corresponds to a astronomically large number of shapes this string may have finally there exists the second critical coupling which is found to be n above which balancing the energy becomes impossible and simulations gev show immediate collapse of the system in which the energy quickly falls to large negative values clearly of no physical meaning finally admitting that the qcd string balls still remain a theoretical struction let us discuss whether the qcd string balls can still be produced in experiments march wspc book trim size for in in allinone string balls we already discussed in the preceeding section that tube geometry of the surface naturally leads to a periodic coordinate and thermal description the cumference of the tube is identied with the matsubara time t inverse to the eective string temperature at certain values of the impact parameter this temperature corresponds to the hagedorn value the eective tension of the string decreases and its high excitations become possible as a result as one can expect and indeed sees it directly in the observed elastic scattering prole the scattering amplitude for such b exceeds the value interpolated by a pomeron string expression from large b there are two explanations proposed in literature for this rapid increase of the scattering prole at certain b the mainstream one is that pomeron plitude becomes too large and needs uitarization or shadowing by certain pomeron amplitudes it is also possible that the hagedorn transition suggested in ref shuryak and zahed is at play so that it is the mixed phase with long strings whatever is the interpretation the way to experimentally proceed is to study double diraction or pomeron pomeron collisions as discussed in refs for a long time we already seen production of scalar and tensor glueballs studying in detail the created system with few gev mass is a way to go march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd ux tubes march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter holographic gauge gravity duality in the qcd related setting the rst example of the duality is that between the weak coupling description in uv in which the elds are quarks and gluons and the chiral eective lagrangians describing ir properties in terms of light mesons more attention in these lectures was devoted to electric magnetic duality also related with the rg evolution from the uv to ir momentum scales it goes from the electric description in terms of quarks and gluons to magnetic one in terms of monopoles and dyons the dualities we are going to discuss in this and the next chapters are a bit dierent they are holographic the uv and ir ends are in this case connected by an extra coordinate called z or u the lagrangians and equations of motion are written for elds living in the bulk between the two limits the rg ow becomes just their dynamics in extra dimensions after the problem in the bulk is solved the physical predictions are extracted holographically by projecting via certain procedures of the results on the boundary where the qcd like gauge theories are located as this projection goes pointlike fundamental objects in the bulk become how blurred on the uv boundary a single point source in a bulk generates an instanton on the boundary of some nite size equal to the distance to the source a pointlike fundamental string in the bulk corresponds to nite width qcd string any object moving into ir appears growing in size on the boundary this is how one describe reball explosions of high energy collisions d branes d branes are topological solitons of the string theory but since we are not requiring its knowledge we will not discuss their structure in depth the reader interested in their historical origins and structure should consult e the tasi lecture of polchinski rodrigues and wotzasek or the original papers mentioned there our aim in this chapter is to explain the geometric properties march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality of these objects and their connections to our main object of interest the gauge theories there is no place here to present string theory but we need to start with it to some elementary extent strings are extended object with one spatial extension moving in time their dynamics is described by d d dimensional external coordinates x of some manifold m all being the functions of two internal coordinates a a also sometimes called with time like and space like natures respectively the resulting d surface is a world history of the string agation obviously the string action should be invariant under re parameterization of both sets of coordinates classic example is the nambu goto action s ax where the dimensional coecient for historical reasons is written like this with the constant has prime derivative because it has been rst introduced as the slope of the regge trajectories for qcd strings it dened their tension and also for fundamental string theory its value denes the basic scale of the theory the bosonic strings are in d while superstrings with fermions can be formulated in d or the branes or more properly dp branes can be seen as a generalization of the concept of a string to an object with p spatial coordinates the letter d in the name came from the dirichlet boundary condition x const on the manifold boundary m as opposed to neumann boundary condition for the derivative at the boundary brane world history is dimensional manifold as they can move in time at p the brane is a string like object like the fundamental string it has the same classical action except a coecient the string tension is dierent for reasons soon to become obvious a choice most popular for applications is the branes including time this one has p internal coordinates since this number is less than the space time of the superstring theory there are extra dimensions in which such branes can move and interact as for any soliton symmetries induce the zero modes of the branes such as simple shifts of the object as a whole when collective coordinates corresponding to shifts and other zero modes are gently modulated coordinate dependence have small gradients these near symmetries generate massless goldstone modes one it can classify all of them and calculate the corresponding eective lagrangian turns out that spin of these modes can be therefore interactions induced by their exchange between branes appear to be gravity vector like and scalar like appearing during string quantization cancels in these dimensions we will not consider string quantization but we discussed some of its consequences in chapter on the qcd strings will not discuss theory of everything based on superstrings aiming to nd a theory unifying gravity with the standard model march wspc book trim size for in in allinone brane perturbations induce eective gauge theories brane perturbations induce eective gauge theories suppose one nds a dimensional membrane solution for the d branes with without knowing its internal structure one can in general determine its lowest excitations the issue is no dierent from any other membrane e that of a drum one may start from a at membrane with coordinates inside it x p and then deform it to y x the displacements a are of two kinds i one with external to the brane ii and another with internal to the brane from the point of view of a dimensional observer living on the brane the rst type corresponds to some scalar elds while the second are vector elds as the index direction can be recognized the corresponding eective action of the deformed membrane is known as the born infeld action it can be determined from general principles if the action is proportional to the area times some undetermined coecient the tension tp det gab bab sp tp the dierential geometry tells us that the square root of the determinant of the ternal metric gab a b p is needed in order to get the invariant volume element and the dilaton appear from this determinant as well the term fab central to our discussion is the abelian eld strength sponding to vector displacement eld aa internal part if the gauge eld coecient is considered small the square root can be expanded to second order resulting in the lagrangian for the eective u theory or induced electrodynamics one can understand its appearance as follows suppose dimensions x x do belong to the brane and there is one nonzero eld component so that one can set the displacement to be x what it means is certain linear stretching of a brane along direction by amount proportional to x such that the volume element will increase now containing a factor dx this is cisely a correction which a nonzero in the born infeld determinant will produce in such setting the factor is just a matter of eld normalization the term bab is related with the magnetic charge density of the brane let me not specify its role and structure at this point as it is not that important for what follows let us now make a more complicated example with n p branes placed together at the same place open strings then obtain indices at both ends i j n the displacements can be described by the matrix valued vector elds a ij the central consequence of this construction is that the corresponding born infeld action will march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality then contain the correct non abelian eld strength f with the commutator term as prescribed by yang and mills this means that the vibrations of n p branes are described by some eective non abelian gauge theory this is the reason why the string theory can be related with the physical gauge theories how important this observation is depends on the opinion which are vary vastly across the theory community the maximalists in the string theory community think that the u su gauge groups of the standard model are eective theories in this very sense that we do live on the brane and hope that one day we will be able to nd out how exactly the compactication of unwanted extra dimensions will explain everything or even discover these extra dimensions experimentally su the minimalists to which most people outside the string community like myself belong take this fact as a mathematical statement providing very useful theoretical tools to model the problem one wants to solve whatever people s hopes may be the fact remains that we have no good ideas about compactication scale of the extra dimensions experimentally it can be from something like tev to the inverse plank mass or thus even if we do live on a brane we may never be able to nd that out given obvious experimental limitations but nothing stops us from using the theoretical models which originated from this construction as a mathematical tool indeed as we will see below one can vent certain brane constructions whose vibration spectrum is capable of reproducing the qcd spectrum of hadrons furthermore one can calculate eective chiral grangians thermal and even transport properties of strongly coupled quark gluon brane constructions a stack of branes the main construction leading to ads cft is a stack of nc coincident branes that is located at the same spatial point in external coordinates a brane is a location at which string can end the nonexcited string has a mass equal to its nc massless vector length times the tension so if the length is zero we have nc elds thus this construction has just enough vector elds to generate su nc eective gauge theory as another example one can consider non coincident branes separated in external coordinates by some distances rij i j nc the strings between them would have masses proportional to these distances in this way one can generate models with higgsing like georgy glashow model of weak interactions are of course also applications of the gauge string correspondence outside qcd in the strongly coupled systems in condense matter theory which we of course will not discuss march wspc book trim size for in in allinone brane constructions let us just point out that the extra coordinate can be compactied to a cle this will generate strings with the lengths proportional to nc lengths of the segments this model will split gluons into massless and massive ones modelling the adjoint higgsing happening when the polyakov line has a nonzero vev recall that precisely in this setting we came to understand instanton dyons or specically why in this case the instanton a complete wrapping of the whole circle can be seen as consisting out of nc massive segments the nc types of the selfdual instanton dyons we will not discuss this idea in full see the original paper lee and lu the seiberg witten curve from the branes one more beautiful brane construction witten explains how the celebrated curve for sym and related theories can be interpreted and calculated directly from the equilibrium minimal action brane shape n it includes branes extended in coordinates located at and some values to be called i like in a previous subsection those are connected by some lower dimensional branes now of the dimension they have innite extension in coordinates and nite in namely between the positions of the i it is depicted in the fig in which is the horizontal direction and the complexied coordinate v runs vertically one may think of to be also complexied together with the th coordinate into t exp where r is the radius of a circle to which the latter can be compactied this variable is then single valued the horizontal branes would pull the vertical ones and if the tensions are not balanced as in the left picture they would displace the vertical branse more they would create certain dimples on the at large distance in from such dimple the curve must satisfy the laplace eqn v which in dimensions complex v produce solution which is not constant even at large v adding or subtracting those change the coecient of the this is a change of a perturbative beta function type iib string theory has odd dimensional branes which naturally generate gauge elds theories and so far we dealt with them only dimension branes lead to multi index forms and to get a gauge eld out of it is done by another procedure related with nonzero holonomy for those forms see the paper march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality fig the vertical thick lines are branes this direction corresponds to complexied dinate v the horizontal lines along are branes we show two of them which corresponds to color left picture has adjoint matter and the forces on the branes are unbalanced thus the branes are logariphmically bent at large v right picture has external lines depicting avors of fundamentally charged matter those balanced the forces on branes and make its position at large v balanced which thus produces a conformal theory with xed coupling thin dashed line on the left connecting branes will correspond to adjoint matter particle or monopole its length is associated with the higgs vev a or dual ad if tensions are balanced like the right picture with avors of fundamental matter a conformal theory emerges in fact this paper lead to may new conformal models the positions of those horizontal branes in v correspond to masses of all those avors the d world and also the d gauge theory appears in the world volume of horizontal branes and their mutual higgsing depends in the vertical distance in v see the dashed line and the log correspond to perturbative running of that coupling lower dimensional ones branes can be considered as becoming narrow tubes made of branes furthermore simple plots in the gure are for rigid strings represented by the straight lines in fact they are exible and will bend to get to a minimal energy shape its zero laplacian is obtained as usual by complexication and then using function depending on z but not its conjugate z let us imagine the shape of the branes is given by some equation since there are two of them it should be quadratic the power of v in the coecient is the number of horizontal branes e in our left gure but on the right one zero t corresponds to innite so roots of are right going branes a root of is t so those count lines going to the left or march wspc book trim size for in in allinone brane interactions ads suppose we do nt want any avors of fundamental matter then a c can be constants rescaled to the equation which can be further rescaled by t t into a form with b being degree k polynomial which is a known curve for sym adding fundamental matter is then making a c non constant in summary this brane construction leads to explicit derivation of the witten curve while they had to guess it in their original paper brane interactions ads closed strings form certain bosonic excitations described by elds in the dimensional external string space those are the graviton g dilaton antisymmetric tensor b and vector eld a the corresponding classical tree level eective action is s r hh e ff the constants as well as loop corrections of higher orders in can in principle be calculated here r is the scalar curvature dened via the metric tensor hilbert action of general relativity and h f are the eld strength tensors for b a elds supersymmetric extension of this action makes full classical d supergravity sugra any objects existing in the theory interact at large distances via an exchange of those massless elds d branes are such objects and in fact they do have certain mass and charge densities in respect to a b elds let us now be more specic and discuss the elds induced by the branes around them in the bulk as they have no extension in some coordinates e just tioned coordinates for brane their elds are that of a point objects in general relativity this naturally implies that they are black hole like in such nates as they are extended in other coordinates the proper name of such objects is black branes to nd out their properties in classical no loops or quantum tuations approximation one has to solve coupled einstein maxwell scalar eqns looking for static spherically symmetric solutions this is no more dicult than to nd the schwartzschild solution for the usual black hole which we remind has a metric tensor in spherical coordinates gdxdx rh rh r march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality and the horizon radius in fulll units is rh m containing the mass m and newton constant gn the horizon zero of is the event horizon a distant observer can not see beyond similar expressions with appropriate powers of the distance can be derived for p branes note that at large distance r rh deviations from at metrics is a small tion there the nonrelativistic potential description of newtonian gravity is possible similarly far from a brane the elds are just given by mulae in corresponding dimensions and it is not hard to gure out what are their mutual interactions it is important that these densities are related in a nontrivial way like the bps magnetic monopoles we had studied above the d branes are bps objects it means attractive forces newtonian due to gravity as well as to the dilaton exchange and repulsive coulomb forces due to vector exchanges cancel each other so that two parallel d branes do not interact the d and anti d are not bps as a result a brane engineer may consider a number of parallel branes to number be put at some random points and they will stay there large nc of branes put into the same point combine their mass and thus create strong ity eld justifying the use of classical einstein maxwell eqns open string states which keep their ends on some branes i and j lead to eective gauge theory on the brane with the u nc group the bps objects still have quantum interaction and can form bound states in particular electric particles quarks gluons as well as monopoles and dyons can form positronium like series of coulombic bound states explicit examples are e well studied in the context of sym the seiberg witten theory generalization of all of that to multidimensional sugra had also been studied in this case of course gravity is added to coulombic electric magnetic forces as well as yukawa ones tuning the parameters one may make gravity to become even dominant the corresponding bound states have been called galaxies in such limits the reader interested in this developments can consult e the lectures by n when the black hole has a nonzero vector charge the gauss law insists on constant ux through sphere of any radius thus there are nonzero elds at large r and schwartzschild solution gets modied into a charged black hole for totically at spaces there is the famous statement much emphasized by wheeler there are no scalar hairs of black holes as there is no gauss theorem to protect them this happens to be not true in general and for spaces which are ads like thus scalars should not be left the solution for brane happens to be the so called extremal dimensional charged black hole which has the lowest possible mass for a given charge when that both metric elements grr change sign at the horizon so in a way the time and space exchange places it indicates that the schwartzschild like metrics can not be used beyond horizon some other versions of metric however can do it see gr textbooks fact there is a whole recent direction based on solution with a scalar atmosphere around black branes providing gravity dual to superconductors on the boundary march wspc book trim size for in in allinone ads cft correspondence the mass decreases to the extreme value the horizon shrinks to nothing and thus it is especially simple spherical symmetry in allows one to separate the angles making the dim sphere from the radius r in dimensions orthogonal to our world space and write the resulting d metrics as follows again at large r all corrections are small and we have the asymptotically at space there ads cft correspondence ads cft correspondence maldacena is a duality between specic gauge theory known as super yang mills theory sym in dimensions and the dimensional superstring theory in a specic setting n step one toward the space starts from the black hole metric which can be in certain region be simplied in fact we will only need the metric in the near horizon region at r l when in both roots can be ignored if so in the last term two cancels out and the dimensional sphere element gets constant ecient and thus gets decoupled from other coordinates thus quantum numbers or motion in becomes kind of internal quantum numbers like avor in qcd and it will be mostly ignored from now on what is left is very simple dimensional metric known as anti de sitter metric using a new coordinate r we get it into the standard form used below note that counts the distance from the ads boundary z this metric has no scale and is not asymptotically at even at the boundary performing dilatation on these coordinates we nd that the metric remains invariant in fact one can do any conformal transformation it is this metric which is ads in the ads cft correspondence and string theory in this background is holographically gravity dual to some conformal gauge theory at the boundary so far nothing unusual happened all formulae came straight from string and general relativity textbooks a truly remarkable theoretical discovery is the so called holography the exact duality one to one correspondence between the dim bulk eective theory in to dim boundary r gauge theory there is a dictionary relating any observable in the gauge theory to another one in string theory the duality implies that all answers are the same in both formulations we will see below how it works by examples the last step which makes it useful is the maldacena relations between the gauge coupling the ads radius l and the string tension which comes from the march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality total mass of the brane set it tells us that large gauge coupling corresponds to large ads radius in string units and one can use classical rather than quantum gravity at the same may remain small so one may do time the string and gravity couplings gs perturbative calculations in the bulk a dl at this point many readers are probably very confused by new th dimension of space one possible approach is to think of it as just a mathematical trick somewhat analogous to more familiar introduction of the complex however there is a perfectly physical meaning of the th coordinate one hint is provided by the b fact that distance along it a z a is the logarithm of the ratio thus its meaning is the scale the argument of the renormalization group if one takes a bulk object and move it into larger z its hologram at the boundary grows in size this direction thus corresponds to the infrared direction the running coupling constant would thus be a z dependent eld called dilaton indeed there are theories with gravity dual in which this eld related to the coupling does run in z unfortunately known examples do not yet include qcd in spite of that there are eorts to built its gravity dual bottom up introducing weak coupling at ultraviolet small z shuryak and connement in infrared large karch et al gursoy and kiritsis by certain modication of the rules these approaches known as ads qcd we would not discuss in this review except briey in the subsection on bulk viscosity n the simplied metric above is very simple it apparently has no scale and has a conformal symmetry matching that of the eective boundary theory which is sym that observation was the basis for maldacena ads cft dence let me start with our rst example of the ads cft at work related with the strong coupling version of the coulomb law calculated in mal the setting to be called the maldecena dipole is shown in fig includes two static charges heavy fundamental quarks separated by the distance r at weak coupling the usual qed we think of one charge creating the electric potential in which the other is placed leading to the usual coulomb law which in our notation is v l l in the theory at weak coupling the only dierence is that one can exchange massless scalars on top of gluons it is always attractive and for two heavy quarks n suppose an experimentalist measured some complicated cross section which is approximately a sum of breit wigner resonances his friend phenomenologist may be able to write the answer as an analytic function with certain pole singularities in the complex energy plane which will help for tting and for evaluating integrals even better their other friend theorist cleverly developed a bulk theory deriving the pole positions from some interaction laws on the complex plane march wspc book trim size for in in allinone ads cft correspondence setting of the maldacena dipole two charges at the boundary black dots are fig nected by the string shown by solid curve pending under gravity toward the ads center z classical graviton propagator the dashed line should be used to calculate the hologram the stress tensor at the observation point y the string is the gravity source the point a has to be integrated over leads to cancellation of the force with doubling for quark antiquark we discuss now the qed coupling changes to t hooft coupling proportional to the number of colors nc now we turn to the ads cft for the theory at strong coupling cena the electric ux in the bulk forms a singular object the fundamental or f string shown by the solid curve in fig which bends from the ary z due to gravity force into the th dimension like in the famous catenary chain the calculation thus follows from nambu goto action for the string whose general form is n s dd detgm n x m x n where coordinates parameterize the string world line x m where m n are space time indices in the whole space reduced to in ads cft gm n is the space metric and det stands for matrix with all in the metric and we can think of as we need the components our coordinates t the string is then described by only one function and its action is reduced to s dtdx we will use this action for falling strings below and now proceed to further simplications for static string for which there is no time derivative and the function is maldacena uses and thus the lagrangian becomes l more einsteinian way to explain it is to note that this is simply the shortest string possible it is not straight because the space is curved it is the same reason why the shortest path from new york to london does not look straight on the map zxlya march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality u with comma meaning the derivative one more simplication comes from the fact that does not appear in it thus an energy is conserved h q l l u u x l e const which reduces the eom from second order eqn to just u can nally be directly integrated to which u um the minimum position of the string um is related to e by the relation following from this formula at plugging the solution back into action and removing divergence which is independent of l gives nally the total string energy which is the celebrated new coulomb law at strong coupling v l l the power of distance l is in fact the only one possible by dimension as the theory is conformal and has no scales of its own what is remarkable is the now famous appearing instead of in the weak coupling the numerical coecient in the rst bracket is to be compared to the result from a diagrammatic summation below what is the reason for this modication for pedagogical reasons let me start with two naive but reasonable guesses both to be shown to be wrong later in this section i one idea is that strongly coupled vacuum acts like some kind of a which is reducing the eect of the independent dielectric constant coulomb eld similarly at all points perhaps such dielectric constant has nonlinear eects and thus is not the same at dierent points but the elds created by static dipole are still just the electric eld as we get glimpse of some rst results from ads cft we see that they are quite dierent from those in weak coupling one would like to understand them better both from the bulk gravity side as well as from the gauge theory side but before we discuss this problem we perhaps need to recall how this problem is solved for the familiar coulomb forces in weak coupling since we consider a static time independent problem one can rotate time t into its euclidean version it which simplies calculation of the perturbative diagrams a static charge generates a wilson line operator w p march wspc book trim size for in in allinone ads cft correspondence and the negative charge produce a conjugated line the two are separated by the distance l the exponents can be expanded in powers of the coupling g the lowest order is the rst one the correlator of the two a elds is the propagator its endpoints resign at the two lines thus a double integral running over both lines v tmax l where large regulator time tmax is introduced the denominator the square of the euclidean distance between the gluon emission and absorption points comes from the euclidean propagator in at space time note that the propagation l this time of a virtual exchange gluon is of the order of the distance cancels one power of l and thus one gets the usual coulomb potential l it turns out the rst is relatively easy for example both in the total energy and energy density we get because this factor is in front of the nambu goto lagrangian in proper units the reason the eld decays as is extremely natural in the space time the eld of a static object a single time integral over the d propagator analogous to coulomb r in at has that very power of distance in fact it is ps with z being the th coordinate of the source and r the distance between it and the observation point thus it is likely to be a bulk gravity scalr exchanges rather than the vector elds note that gravity scalar forces have no cancellations between opposite charges unlike the vector ones in order to understand the same results from the gauge side we will need a bit of pedagogical introduction the resolution will be given by the idea of short color correlation time by zahed and myself shuryak and zahed in qcd with its running coupling higher order eects modify the zeroth order coulomb eld potential higher order diagrams include self coupling of gluons scalars and multiple actions with the charges a famous simplication proposed by t hooft is the large number of colors limit in which only planar diagrams should be considered people suggested that as g grows those diagrams are becoming shnets with smaller and smaller holes converging to a membrane or string worldline but although this idea was fueling decades of studies trying to cast gauge theory into stringy form it have not strictly speaking succeeded it may still be true just nobody was smart enough to sum up all planar if one does not want to give up on re summation idea one may consider a subset of those the ladders which can be summed up semeno and zarembo semeno and zarembo have done that let us look what have they found ads cft is kind of a solution actually but it is doing it indirectly march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality the rst point is that in order that each rung of the ladder contributes a factor nc emission time ordering should be strictly enforced on each charge let us call these time moments and ladder diagrams must connect to otherwise it is nonplanar and subleading diagram thus the main dierence from the abelian theory comes from the dynamics of the color vector the re summed bethe salpeter kernel t describing the evolution from time zero to times s t at two lines satises the following integral equation s t s ds t s t if this eqn is solved one gets re summation of all the ladder diagram the kernel if the equation is obviously satises the boundary condition solved the ladder generated potential is s t t lim t t t in weak coupling and the integral on the rhs is easily taken resulting in the usual coulomb law for solving it at any coupling it is convenient to switch to the dierential equation s t s t s t and change variables to and y through s t s t m with the corresponding boundary condition kernel on the relative times follows from the dierential equation the dependence of the m for large the dominant part of the potential in is from small relative times resulting into a harmonic equation semeno and zarembo at large times the kernel is dominated by the lowest harmonic mode for large times s t t that is small and large y y e e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holography at work from it follows that in the strong coupling limit the ladder generated tential is l which has the same parametric form as the one derived from the ads cft spondence except for the overall coecient note that the dierence is not so large since is larger than the exact value by about why did it happened that the potential is reduced relative to the coulomb law by it is because the relative time between gluon emissions is no longer l as in the abelian case but reduced to parametrically small time of relative color coherence thus we learned an important lesson in the strong coupling regime c even the static charges communicate with each other via high frequency gluons and scalars propagating in euclidean formulation with a super luminal velocity v this idea although it seemed to be too bizarre to be true as we will see below to explain some of the ads cft results klebanov maldacena and thorn klebanov et al have pointed out that the reason the stress tensor around l is actually the dipole is dierent from perturbative one by a factor i am sure explained by limited relative emission time by color coherence time possible usage of this idea does not ends here before we leave the subject of maldacena dipole one more interesting question is what happen if one of the charges makes a small accelerated motion near its original position will there be a radiation in a somewhat dierent setting than used above the answer was provided by mikhailov mikhailov he studied perturbations of the string and found that the radiated energy is described by familiar classical lienard formula e a dt in which qed weak coupling constant a coupling a is substituted by cft strong holography at work for pedagogical reasons let me split this idea into two parts the rst one is the usual bulk boundary relation in general let us recall our setting there is the time x p internal and d p external coordinates imagine some creatures which live inside the internal coordinates and are not aware of the external ones we of course do live on the surface of the earth with but we can see up and down and are aware of stars above so at this stage one should some blind insects which can not jump or dig in with only these imagine e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality fig the boundary or two such events black dots setting of the bulk point event black dots at distance z from the boundary at two coordinates imprinted in their branes suppose these creatures are intelligent enough to develop their theory of the world obviously p dimensional describing what happens in it say consequences of earthquakes or fallen meteorites while originated externally create displacements of the surface which can be described by certain scalar and vector elds as we described above perhaps our creatures can send surface vibrations themselves and communicate by those as we use sounds perhaps they can even travel and understand that earth is topologically a sphere and even develop a theory about existence of the radial extra dimension unifying their previously separate scalar and vector elds into common vector displacement elds in dimensions it may be that our dimension is a brane in a larger dimensions and events we observe like our big bang have in fact simple external causes there are many fascinating papers about that but this text is not a place to follow this at this point purely speculative possibility the second statement is truly unusual it deals with the holography between the near horizon region of the bulk and the observers at the boundary of the black it historically started with the discussions of the information paradox of holes classical gravity which states that information can fall into a black hole and get lost for the outside hawking famously found that black holes should emit thermal radiation with t given by their total mass m bekenstein argued that since in thermodynamics dm t ds one can evaluate the universal amount of entropy produced when you increase the black hole mass by dm the black hole entropy scales as its area so it is expected to be stored in the vicinity of the horizon these developments lead to loss of information which is the same as entropy growth is of course rather standard nomenon in statistical mechanics everyone knows that if you throw a book into a bonre the information contained in it is lost same may happen if you drop a book into a black hole however from quantum mechanical point of view the pure state should remain pure state so the information should be somehow recoverable we will not discuss huge literature on this information paradox dropping your ph d thesis weighting kg or an equivalent kg stone produce the same amount of entropy x march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holography at work an idea that some relation should exist between the dynamics history observed far from black hole in d dimensional space and its compactied form by strong gravity in the d dimensional region near horizon the holographic ads cft duality is in fact a precise correspondence between the two namely that certain boundary and near horizon theories can be dual to each other in the sense of complete exact equivalence the boundary eective theory is not only applicable to describe something like long wavelength sounds as is always the case but it is in fact an exact copy of the bulk quantum theory ads cft correspondence is believed to be one of such examples many test have been performed and they all passed well yet we do nt have a formal proof of it a hologram of a point space time source an instanton instead of discussing deep issues related to holography let me demonstrate few examples of how one use it in applications our rst example would be an image brane because its word of a point space time event sometimes called the d history has dimension p seen on the boundary see fig since a point can not produce vector or tensor eld it lacks directions for the indices the only light bulk eld it can emit are the two scalars the axion and the dilaton it thus immediately follows that the hologrphic image would be lacking any energy and momentum since only g can induce the stress tensor t but there would be non zero values of the operators and g if the object has the same couplings to both the images be also equal perhaps up to a sign in order to calculate this simplest diagram one needs bulk to boundary gators in which we discuss in appendix in the usual coordinates in which the metric is dx dx with and convolution done with the usual minkowski metric with minus one for the zeroth component feynman the analytically continued euclidean propagator is expected to be just the function of the invariant distance x between the two points which in this space is x p p x in fact the propagator is just a power of the combination in the r s above namely x x x the holography is a projection from the dimensional bulk to it is done in two steps i one should take one point dimensional boundary hologram keeps all d information in a plane march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality to the boundary dimensionality of the boundary operator in question should be amputated the power of of the amplitude corresponding to the example both operators and g g have mass dimension thus one should amputate exactly the powers of in the propagator thus we recover the butions of these quantities at the boundary g x x so it now becomes clear that the object found on the boundary as an image of the bulk point event is nothing else but the gauge eld instanton the th coordinate of the bulk point z is nothing else but the instanton radius conrming the idea that it is a scale variable note further that a bulk point even can not be couple to gravitons as a point lacks needed indices to make a tensor eld in the example at hand it implies that gauge instantons must have zero stress tensor t at any point which is also true and relations between the gauge theory instantons in sym and the space has been noticed independently and simultaneously with the ads cft dence while studying the semiclassical weak coupling instantons in et al see also a review et al basically the instanton moduli space includes the space if z is the th coordinate for example the volume element of the metric f is n which is a factor well familiar from the semiclassical instanton measure what this agreement tells us is that instantons of the sym populate the internal space homogeneously n the same logic then implies that the interaction between instanton antiinstanton pair is given by the diagram fig in which one should use the same to bulk scalar propagator in which is the function of geodesic distance between two points in the bulk one indeed obtains this nontrivial result now in much simpler and geometrically motivated way that we did in the instanton chapter let us complete this example with one important comment the holography just described can not give us boundary gauge eld a of the instanton or in fact anything having a color index we only get colorless operators g and a statement about t which are coupled to bulk massless elds that the fact that instantons describe classical tunneling paths only require zero stress at endpoints not locally everywhere march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holography at work fig angular distribution of the far eld energy versus the polar angle solid black line is the ads cft result compared to the perturbative dipole energy the dashed blue line both normalized at zero angle y a hologram of the maldacena dipole in the leading order in weak coupling the only eld is electric and the eld of a dipole is just a linear superposition of the two coulomb elds of the charges g ym ym ym ym because of the cancellation between these two terms at large distances from the l the corresponding energy density and other dipole the eld decays as e components of the stress tensor are thus of the order in the strong coupling one has to calculate the hologram of the pending string construction explained above the stress tensor of matter at any point on the boundary comes from the gravitational eld of that string calculated in the bulk and then approximated near the boundary lin and myself lin and shuryak have found it the solution is rather technical to be presented here in full and even the resulting stress tensor expressions are rather long let me just comment that there are some general requirements which should be satised used to verify explicitly that no mistake in the calculation was made the stress tensor should be traceless t because the boundary theory is conformal and it should have zero covariant divergence t because there are no sources away from the charges themselves let me just illustrate one point using the leading large distance term at the y l y where are numerical constants whose values can be looked up in the paper and is the angular distribution it is shown by solid line in fig to be compared to that in weak coupling the dashed line march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality a hologram of a particle falling in the ads bulk the example in this subsection can be put in a setting quite dierent in scope from ads cft correspondence now we ask the reader to imagine that instead of using it as a mathematical tool similar in spirit to extending functions to complex plane we for a moment assume it to be the true picture of the physical universe specically imagine that we indeed live on the brane where all gauge elds of the standard model are dened but there are more dimensions of space and gravity act in bulk what would be our perception the hologram of a bulk particle so to say a bulk meteorite ying by of course any must y on some geodesic as a stone thrown into a nonzero gravity eld for example at t it can y toward the boundary in z direction then stop at t at some distance from it and then fall back to the ads center since stone has a nonzero stress tensor m x x it can be coupled to the bulk metric perturbations g and via t stone the gravitational propagator produce a holographic stress tensor on the boundary the hologram can again be obtained by ndding the bulk x expanding it at small z and reading the coecient of the th power of z as we did above the result is a spherically symmetric implosion and then explosion however this time we will use a dierent method using this occasion to learn a bit more about geometry of the space we will follow friess et al which uses the so called global coordinates recall that e a d dimensional sphere of radius r can be described by its imbedding into the d space in which it is dened by the equation x x similarly the space can be described by the equation x x x x x x in the dimensional space x relation to the coordinates the usual ones for hyperboloids is x note that there are two negative signs the x x x i l l the last term contains the coordinates of the unit sphere with standard line element the point is there exist another set known as poincare coordinates dened by example before was a point even in the bulk or brane a particle has a path it is a brane no space extension but with time dependent path march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holography at work x xi z x l t z x i l x one can eliminate global coordinates and get the relation between these two sets and t left as an exercise l limit in which all x a understanding of the construction can be started from the boundary the large here just runs a circle and is a d sphere with constant spatial curvature this world is known as einstein s static universe the poincare coordinates at large z are just minkowskian the boundary relation is relatively simpler to do it is t l l i this is a map between the curved einsteinian and at minkowskian d universes let us now switch to the relation between the dierentials of both set of nates and work out their correspondence and the metrics after going through it one nds the following metric tensor w d where the so called conformal factor is w the next step is upgrading the ads to the so called global ads schwartzschield black hole gadsbh a charged d black hole which we will need below anyway its line element corresponds to the metric d where have the same meaning as standard coordinates above this metric is a solution to the einstein equation with a particular cosmological term gab and l are two parameters related to the mass and charge of the black hole here for reference are such relations including the bekenstein entropy and the hawking temperature rab m s t h h h march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality where the horizon radius the upper root of is is the d newton constant which is related to l and the brane number n via h l n note that if n plank scale and thus gravity is classical is large than the space parameter l is large compared to the this black hole is to play a role of a meteorite ying in the bulk away from our brane world in principle one can consider its mass and thus h to be small parameters and expand in it to the order but it is not really needed in the way we just described it it is a static bh sitting at the origin but this is just because standard coordinates used describe everything from the bh point of view our coordinates the same poincare ones as dened above are related with the standard ones by the same coordinate transformation since those are moving time dependent relative to the bh in such coordinates the bh does y the elegant solution we describe calculates t using static black hole metric in global ads in standard coordinates and then just transform this tensor in the poincare coordinates the result written in the usual minkowski spherical coordinates t r takes relatively simple form t w w where l is a parameter and w is the conformal factor f of metric tion given above it is instructive to check that this stress tensor is traceless and conserved t so there is no source for it in the minkowski world it is so to say spherical an implosion at t and explosion at t coming and going to innity at t holographic collisions show no signs of jets here we present results of calculation lin and shuryak lin and shuryak modelling what happens when the two ends of the open string charges however that this phenomenon has nothing to do with hydrodynamics as this tensor can not be written in the form of a moving uid march wspc book trim size for in in allinone thermal ads cft and strongly coupled plasma located on the boundary move away from each other with certain v this setting corresponds to a process in which some neutral object highly virtual photon or z boson decays into quark antiquark pair in qcd due to asymptotic qcd the corresponding coupling is freedom at large total mass m weak and quarks produce a sequence of rather distant gluons along their way this is indeed what is observed as two jet events experimentally the question we now address is what happens in strong coupling when is large and gluons interact strongly between quarks and themselves in particular would there be any visible jets along the direction of motion of the charges in order to answer it one needs to solve rst equation of motion for the string simultaneously falling into the ads space due to gravity and expansing between the receeding charges then one needs to calculate the eective stress tensor source the falling string provides and nally using propagators in the ads space one can calculate the induced stress tensor perturbation on the boundary all these steps are highly technical and details should be looked at in the original papers in fig we show as an example the momentum density distribution on the boundary charges move relativistically in the horizontal direction the answer to the question raised above is now clear at strong coupling there are no jets there is some kind of collective explosion it however can not be a hydrodynamical ow of some ideal uid we see this because stress tensor is very anisotropic even in the rest frame of each element thermal ads cft and strongly coupled plasma let me briey remind few more facts from the black hole toolbox studies of how quantum eld theory can sit in a background of a classical black hole metrics have resulted in two major discoveries the hawking radiation and the bekenshtein entropy related to horizon radius and area respectively hawking radiation makes black holes in asymptotically at space unstable it and heats the universe till the it black hole disappears putting black hole into a nite box also does not help is generically thermodynamically unstable and gets smaller and hotter till it nally burns out only in appropriate curved spaces black branes can be in thermal equilibrium with their universe lled with radiation at some nite temperature t as shown by witten all one has to do to get its metric is to consider non extreme excited extreme black brane solution which has a horizon let me now make a logical jump and instead of just giving the metric for t solution let me rst provide an intuitive picture for non experts explaining v it is static maldacena dipole if v is small it complements modied coulomb law by the modied ampere law these case are discussed in the paper but in this subsection we only consider ultrarelativistic v march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality fig contour plot of momentum density t m the direction of the momentum density is indicated by normalized arrows the nite temperature witten s settings in which pertinent calculations are done the dimensional space boundary is at minkowskian and sponds to our world where the gauge theory lives in the bulk there is a black hole metric with horizon at z zh the center is located at z but all zh are in fact irrelevant as they are not observable from the boundary studies of nite t conformal plasma by ads cft famously started exactly by evaluation of the bekenstein entropy gubser et al s via calculating the horizon area a now comes the promised intuitive picture this setting can be seen as a ming pool with the gauge theory and us to be referred below as distant servers living on its surface at zero depth z enjoying the desired temperature t in order to achieve that the pool s bottom looks inf initely hot for observers which are sitting at some xed z close to its coordinate zh thus diving to such depth is not recommended strong gravity takes care and stabilizes this setting thermodynamically recall that time units as well as those of energy and ture are subject to warping with component of the metric which vanishes at when astronomers found evidences for black holes and accretion into those the physics of black hole became a regular part of physics since lots of problem have to be solved here important step forward was the so called membrane paradigm exception is heavy quark diusion constant calculated by casalderrey and which needs more complicated settings with a kruskal metric connecting a world to an world through the black hole march wspc book trim size for in in allinone thermal ads cft and strongly coupled plasma developed by many people and best formulated by thorne and collaborators thorne et al known also under the name of stretched horizons its main idea is to imagine that there is a physical membrane at some small distance away from the horizon and that it has properties exactly such that all the eqns maxwell einstein s would have the same solutions outside it as without a membrane but with a continuation through horizon for example a charged black hole would have a membrane with a nonzero charge density to terminate the electric eld lines the fact that poynting vector at the membrane must be pointed inward means some time odd relation between and this is achieved by giving the membrane nite conductivity which in turn leads to ohmic losses heat and entropy generation in it furthermore as shown by damour back in s displacements of the membrane and relations for gravitational analog of the poynting vector leads to nonzero viscosity of the membrane and its eective low frequency theory take the form of navier stokes hydrodynamics for a bit more modern derivations of the eective action and eld theory point of view look at parikh nd wilczek parikh and wilczek as we will see below in this chapter all of those ideas have resurfaced now in ads context generating new energy of young string theorists who now pushed the hydrodynamics of the horizon memebrane well beyond the navier stokes to a regular construction of systematic derivative expansions to any needed order march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic gauge gravity duality march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter holographic qcd as we emphasized it few times already there is no known holographic dual for qcd and yet people tried to build it so to say by bottom up approach it does not have the same status as ads cft correspondence discussed above but obviously a set of made up models which howeve can be rather productive and instructive we start with two crude ideas to be rened later witten and sakai sugimoto models the way from the holographic dual of the sym theory to the usual mills gluodynamics ym was suggesting in witten he emphasized that this step included the high temperature limit of ym theory implying breaking of sypersymmetry yet preserving holographic correspondence n in short the idea is to start with branes rather than ones used for ads cft the unwanted direction of space is compactied on a circle with mkk the mkk being the so called kaluza kline mass circumference the metric of the witten background is u r dxdx r u f u is the warping depending on the holographic where u ordinate u dened for u there is also a dilaton eld and form ramon eld in this background which we would not go into here are minkowski coordinates and the extra spatial coordinate is the key feature here is that the radius of vanishes at the geometry thus has the so called cigar form with its tip at the euclidean form of the nite t theory corresponds to the time also compactied to the matsubara time with circumference t thus there is completely analogous to schwarzschild solution of the usual black hole except the power of distance in the newtonian potential is not r as in dimensions but in dimensions march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic qcd are two competing phases of this theory a cigar in one ciclic variable and tube in another the lowest free energy corresponds to the winning phase this phase transition witten identied with the deconnement phase transition in thermal ym theory the deconnement temperature scale is therefore related with mkk dened above generalization of this model to nonzero angle can be done by turning on nonzero form potential along the circle aharonov bohm style so that there is a nontrivial ux of the eld through the cigar in order to get a qcd like model one needs to complement witten s tion for ym theory by inclusion of the light quarks this can be done by rating some nf copies of extra branes posessing fundamental fermions since the number of avors nf is assumed to be small compared to nc they are treated in probe approximation that is neglecting their role in overall metric formation fig upper extensions of the coordinates of and branes lower two phases with chiral symmetry and with its breaking the model we will now discuss is sakai sugimoto model sakai and sugimoto based on nf sets of and branes located at the opposite sides of the witten s cigar in upper part of fig from this paper we show extensions of the and branes the left lower sketch shows how they are connected with the circle being in coordinate which lack if the geometry has two idependent branes corresponding to left and right quarks the chiral symmetry is unbroken it gets however broken if the geometry is as shown in lower right corner in which there is a single brane turning back after it reached some point in the wss geometry thus constructed one can move further studying small perturbation of this brane construction the displacement of the is described by dimensional gauge eld am those with m would be lorentz

has a general form det gm n s t where t is tension fm n is the eld strength corresponding to am assuming the eld is small one can expand the square roots in powers of the eld in quadratic order in fm n it describes masses of and mesons we would not go into details but just comment that mass ratios between those can be calculated from the model and their relation to experiment is reasonable let me emphasize that in fact we have much more then predictions of the meson masses here we have a complete form of eective chiral lagrangian a dream of weinberg leutwyler etc which in qcd is so hard to build note further that the relation between vector and scalar mesons fulll also another dream that of hidden gauge symmetry related with the avor su nf group since in these lectures we devoted a lot of attention to chiral anomaly in its relation to topology and also to chiral eects in general let us explain how sakai and sugimoto had approached these issue holographically they added the following topological action term stopo nc where nc comes from integral over charge of the the rr form the simons form in dimensions z is recall that the cs form is not by itself gauge invariant but its change is t r af t therefore gauge invariant action reproducing qcd chiral anomaly can be dened as the dierence between the boundary values at two ends of the left minus the right handed one we end our discussion of witten sakai sugimoto settings by introducing the dependence of the vacuum energy and calculate it for details we refer to bigazzi et al and only note that always evac as in the dilute instanton gas to make this connection more clearly we would like to mention the topological susceptibilties obtained in these two settings in or sym theory they have at nite temperature setting sy m t nct y m expression is analogous to t relation we used relating to gauge topology march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic qcd and the exponent indeed corresponds to the instanton action the preexponent however has strange square root of nc and no coupling both features i can not explain in simple terms in wym witten sakai sugimoto high t phase the topological susceptibility deduced from the dependence of the vacuum energy the result is w y m t nc t y m in this case nc and on nc and only the ym coupling remains y m nc dependence is such that they cancel dependence in summary holographic model of the theta vacua axions produce predictions for the topological susceptibilities which looks very much like the semiclassical stanton density in exponent but with very dierent pre exponential factors this is hardly surprising by itself since in weak and strong coupling the uctuating elds making the bosonic and fermionic determinants are quite dierent yet some microscopic derivation of expressions given above would be much appreciated instantons as baryonic solitons let me start admitting that we had not covered in this book the skyrmions picturing baryons as heavy classical solitons made of the pion eld this approach is natural in the limit nc in which baryon mass is large and the chiral limit in which pions are massless the so called weiss zumino witten term mq in the chiral lagrangian provides the topological denition of the baryon number which therefore is conserved skyrmions naturally predict large distance forces between nucleons to be pion exchanges however we know from nuclear physics that phenomenology suggest nuclear forces to be described rather in terms of scalar and vector mesons producing attractive and repulsive parts of the forces note furthermore that traction and repulsion obviously are well tuned nearly cancelling each other in sum the wss model just described provide a very curious realization of mesonic soliton idea in the setting explained in the previous section as shown by hata et al the classical solution to d euclidean ym equations used at the lectures at the top of the course describing tunneling in the topological simons landscape can now be interpreted in spatial dimentions of the wss model as a soliton its scalar part corresponds to the skyrmion pion cloud while the vector eld am made u nf vector mesons mesons represent the repulsive baryon core missing from the original skyrme model since instanton is a solution to the linear ym equations it means that interactions between all types of mesons are taken into account consistently march wspc book trim size for in in allinone conning holographic models with walls in the inferared the excited states of instanton baryons with say other meson attached was used as models for pentaquark hadrons the study of high density of instantons turned to be a d crystalline lattice has been rst constructed in shuryak and verbaarschot it was the rst example of time crystal later emphasized by wilczek the same crystalline lattice in the holography setting was later reused as a model for dense baryonic matter if the density is high instantons can be further split into its constituents with fractional topological charge see rho et al conning holographic models with walls in the inferared in spite of strong coupling regime the ads cft setting is scale invariant with coulomb like forces between charges only the coecients of r changes at strong coupling as we already discussed in qcd like holographic models one needs to somhow generate connement the rst crude idea we discuss aims at it was introduced in polchinski and strassler who suggested to simply cut o the most infrared part of the space by brute force indeed if there is no space for the bending string to fall into it would reach the bottom of space and thus generate a linear conning a generic idea can be formulated as follows hadrons would correspond to malizable modes of the ads space modied by some connement related cut o let us show how it works following ref karch et al suppose the metric takes the form dxdx is the at minkowski metric another function the

also limit magnetic strings and thus connes the magnetic monopoles we are not expected to do so in qcd but let us for some time ignore this unwanted feature to be repaired later in the section march wspc book trim size for in in allinone al holographic qcd as usual they satisfy the eigenvalue equation ze where we already look for a d plain wave solution and substituted the momentum squared by the mass squared standard substitution vn transfers it to schreodinger like form n it was argued that the best way to cut the space o is by a gaussian factor in at large z one motivation karch et al is that bulk elds the metric b generate in this case quite perfect regge trajectories as we will see shortly another motivation shuryak is that the instanton size distribution in qcd unlike in the cft does show a gaussian cuto and we now know that the instanton size is in holography just the th coordinate of its pointlike source for the preferred choice of the functions b there is the following analytical solution n vn n where lm n are associated laguerre polynomial note the equidistant spectrum of the vector meson masses which is phenomenologically correct furthermore introducing spin s elds as d symmetric tensors of rank s karch et al one see that the equation of motion is modied to and the spectrum to b n s s which is the phenomenologically correct linear regge trajectory the model can include explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking erlich et al by including the scalar x with the boundary conditions x m where m is the avor matrix of quark masses and is the quark condensate karch et al also got reasonable parameters of the scalar and axial mesons schafer schafer have demonstrated that the whole euclidean vector and axial correlators v built out of these modes duce experimental data within accuracy at any euclidean time these results are extremely similar to what was obtained by schafer and myself in much more sophisticated instanton model schafer and shuryak the remaining march wspc book trim size for in in allinone conning holographic models with walls in the inferared deviations at least at small distances are clearly just neglected perturbative correction s we will however argue that vector axial channels are in fact exceptions rather than the rule and for generic one can not hope to use this simplest model coupling of the boundary sources to elds propagating in the ads bulk does indeed t to the general philosophy of holography yet i do not see any justication to why all those spin s bulk elds may be massless in the dimensional sense string theory can only supply the massless states up to gravitons and even for strict ads cft a generic bulk elds have nonzero and large at large spins and strong coupling anomalous dimensions in the form of the d mass those would appear in the eective schreodinger potential as follows v z m only the vector elds can be exempt on the basis of vector current conservation we follow notations of kkss karch et al except that we have added extra d mass term standard substitution transform this into a schreodinger like eqn without rst order derivatives with v v z m kkss needed only bound state wave functions given in terms of laguerre mials quadratic ir potential was tuned by karch et al to reproduce nice regge trajectories for absent bulk mass they are linear and the absolute units we will use also follow from kkss notations can be xed by calculate some physical mass rho meson is an example of the protected state associated with conserved vector current it has with and s a solution without nodes gives using it as an input we x our unit of length as length unit m m the expected position of the domain wall at large nc is zdw m unit thus most of the wave function is in fact located in the strongly coupled domain and modications due to weakly coupled domain at z zdw turns out to be very small as far as the d spectroscopy goes however hard processes will be sensitive to this small tail of the wave function and their relative normalization is crucial for what follows march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic qcd fig schematic dependence of the thooft coupling on the holographic th coordinate z the domain wall in the ultraviolet the second crude idea try to deal with an unpleasant fact the qcd coupling runs into weak in the uv and so the ads cft like description can not possibly be valid there i have proposed shuryak to include this feature by introducing the so called uv wall beyond which the space is still ads but all d masses of the elds return to their non interacting dimensions where the uv wall should be placed what is its physical nature the guiding idea is again related with the instantons we had discussed large nc limit of the instanton ensemble and have concluded that their size distribution becomes a delta function at some limiting instanton size what can be calculated in this model example include hard exclusive cesses and transition from strong coupling at large distances to weak coupling at small one a jump in power should be seen as a consequence of the change from large anomalous dimensions in strong coupling to naive dimensions for inetracting elds specic example the simplest object of the kind is the pion formfactor tunately experiment has not yet seen how transition to old perturbative prediction takes place as it is very hard to measure it at large q all we know is that the observed at q gev is about twice large than the asymptotic value so some decrease and then leveling at new level should happen as far as i know nobody have seen it on the lattice either the magnitude of the pion formfactor at faccioli et al q but unfortunately the approximation made are not good at large enough q so the transition to the perturbative regime has not been seen in this approach as well more or less similar situation is with the nucleon formfactor and many other exclusive reactions gev induced by instantons has been calculated in ref another hard reaction involving the pion is pion diractive dissociation into two jets rst theoretically discussed by frankfurt et al frankfurt et al and ied experimentally by the fermilab experiment it seems to be showing a transition from the non perturbative to the perturbative regime we are looking for march wspc book trim size for in in allinone improved holographic qcd improved holographic qcd realistic bottom up holographic models with the dilaton axion potentials were gradually developed and in this section we will follow the approach of the kiritsis group gursoy et al gursoy and kiritsis for review see gursoy et al they have developed a systematic approach toward building a gravity dual model to qcd the elds in the action include the tensor metric scalar dilaton and pseudoscalar axion in the common lagrangian one more scalar eld the tachion is added later to model the chiral symmetry breaking and the quark condensate let us start with the pure ym theory for its holographic dual one uses generic form of the action with the bulk and boundary terms s m p n c r v m p n c here r and k are bulk and boundary curvature the factors in front correspond to p n d newton constant c small in the large nc limit the exponent of the dilaton is identied with running thooft coupling y m what needs to be carefully chosen is the potential v as it incorporate the beta function of the theory these details can be found in the original works a clever trick allows to incorporate the beta function which demands rst order dierential eqn with lagrangian formalism which demands second order ones there are basically two types of the solutions with qualitatively dierent metric behavior without or with the black hole aiming at thermal physics of quark gluon plasma we start with euclidean time which with slight abuse of notations we still call t in the former case the following simple ansatz is used dxmdxm in the latter f dxmdxm r the warping factor r has zero at horizon location rh and only r rh are considered these two geometries correspond to low t and high t phases as calculation of their free energy shows the obtained temperature dependence of the thermodynamical quantities energy and entropy densities e and pressure p are compared in fig with the ym lattice data dots in spite of the model assuming large nc limit and the lattice data at physical nc the agreement is rather good the phase transition is of the rst order and as e is the case for elementary van der waals case there is the third solution here called the small black hole which is unstable and correspond to free energy maximum between the two minima march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic qcd we will not go into discussion of kinetic quantities the diusion constant the viscosities the jet quenching parameter which can also be calculated in this model fig temperature dependence of the dimesionless combinations normalized so that they all have large t limit dahsed horizontal line the second plot is the so called trace anomaly combination the measure of the non conformal behavior the next extension of the model is adding the pseudoscalar axion eld a this allows to x negative parity glueballs and also to calculate the topological tibility but we will not discuss it finally one should add quarks to construct really holographic model for qcd the topic has its history which we do not go to but just jump to the paper jarvinen and kiritsis in which quark generating anti branes are not considered in the probe in this work the so called veneziano limit is taken in which the ratio of the number of avors to the number of colors xv eneziano nf nc is kept xed in the nc nf xmax at which the asymptotic freedom is lost

existence of critical value xc mately near separating conformal window at xmax xc in which the system ows in ir into the zero of the beta function and the more common regime we remind the reader that

is related to the nonzero quark condensate the solution to eom is numerical and highly technical details can be found in the original papers so let me only present some results after the background eld conguration is established one can study quantum deviations from it quadratic terms as usual give the excitation spectrum of the elds involved for example excitations of the graviton and dilaton elds give the spectrum of tensor and scalar glueballs connecting those one can obtain the lower parts of multiple daughters regge trajectories as shown in fig fig the and glueball masses on the regge plot j holographic qcd in the veneziano limit at xv eneziano by iatrakis et al m calculated from improved meson scalar gives its own set of excitations more precisely the dilaton and tachion excitations scalar glueballs and scalar mesons get mixed together i will discuss this mixing following iatrakis et al because it was important for understanding interaction strength of the qcd strings and perhaps more tantly it is the part of ads qcd i was involved myself as a brief historic introduction let me just state that in hadronic spectroscopy one can hardly nd more confused subject than scalar mesons experimentally there are more resonances than the simple qq mesons may exist clearly there should be scalar glueballs and quark mesons as well all mixed up in some proportions ads qcd is at least a self consistent model providing a well dened method to calculate these mixings how it works is explained in fig the strings completing this section let me note that expanding the action to terms quadratic in all elds deviations from the background is not the only thing one can do nothing except technical complexity can stop anyone to expand the tion further to the third order dening the interaction constants between all these states the question is not only the magnitude of the coupling but the index structure of the corresponding vertices as well for example as shown by anderson et al the index structure of triple vertex of two tensor elds and pseudoscalar march wspc book trim size for in in allinone holographic qcd fig the determinant of the uv boundary value of two linearly independent solutions of the scalar uctuation equations versus the mass parameter in u v units the red solid line with zeroes indicate values of the lowest scalars from full hamiltonian blue dashed lines and squares indicate unmixed glueball masses and green dash dotted curve and green diamonds indicate mixed meson masses the lowest state sigma meson shifts little but the second meson is close to the rst glueball and their mixing is more serious in fact these two states collide at xv eneziano but including mixing one observe classic avoided crossings of the levels production can be determined uniquely vhho q hh indeed the pomeron is identied with symmetric tensor h which can not be directly paired with an antisymmetric epsilon symbol two momenta of the pomerons need to be also included for obvious reasons if transverse part of the vertex vanishes in general it is predicted to be those are parallel proportional to the azimuthal angle between and the data is in agreement with this prediction unfortunately the index structure of triple vertex of three tensor elds is not unique it may be written in several possible forms the holography however suggests the correct one if all object are holographically related to gravitons one can try to mimic the einstein hilbert action expanded to the third order in h perturbation this idea by iatrakis et al was compared to the imentally observed pomeron pomeron tensors ppt vertex it was shown that the einstein hilbert vertex indeed works for tensor glueball but not for ordinary tensor mesons like other evidences that the pomeron should be accompanied by a tensor polarization were given by ewerz et al march wspc book trim size for in in allinone qcd strings and multi string spaghetti qcd strings and multi string spaghetti in the holographic qcd there are bulk strings moving in a potential created by nontrivial prole of the gravitational metrics as well as the prole of the dilaton the combined potential is shown in fig from iatrakis et al the bulk string is pointlike but since it is at some distance from the boundary its hologram has nite size the radius of the qcd string the oscillations of the bulk string around the minimum of the potential are perceived at the boundary as the breathing mode of the qcd string fig the red solid lin shows eective potential for a string in the bulk as a function of holographic potential z the minimum corresponds to location of a string in equilibrium the string interaction with gravity and dilaton mean that they can interact via exchanges of tensor and scalar glueballs recall their masses displayed in fig in the preceding section the problem is both are rather heavy and the resulting interaction range v is very short this is where the glueball meson mixing becomes relevant it allows the string interact via sigma meson in particle data book now exchange in chapter on qcd strings we discussed it and found that this idea ts the lattice data rather well mglueballr exp multi string congurations are produced in high energy collisions recall that we discussed that pomeron exchange leads to production of at least two strings the collisions of the proton with p b nucleus at lhc depending on impact parameter includes a range of string number from two to about at central collision as the string ends the through going quarks y along the beam directions one nds string in spaghetti situation see fig in the transverse plane which is in holography dimensional these strings has no extension and are shown as just points weak attraction which string have to each

snapshots at early and late time of some particular conguration are shown in fig one can see that they become closer to each other as a result of attraction also they all fall into march wspc book

strings in a plane transverse coordinate holographic coordinate z the set is falling into ir under its common weight march wspc book trim size for in in allinone chapter summary at the end of these lectures let me summarize again the main content of this course semiclassical theory the semiclassical theory in quantum mechanics and qfts is the main technical method on which the applications were based it always implies existence of some parameter due to which the action of certain classical solutions are considered large these solutions are generally extrema of the path integrals in imaginary s euclidean time the contributions of those extrema to the path integral can be then calculated by writing the path in qm or eld conguration in qft as uctuation cl substituting it to the action and reading from it the green functions propagators inverse to the operator of order and vertices of higher orders in one can then use standard feynman diagrams to calculate the eects of these uctuations to the desired order the most simple example of classical euclidean paths are f luctons for which this procedure is most straightforward they are dependent on the point eld conguration for which the density matrix is evaluated semiclassical theory quire the corresponding action be large we also discussed quantum mechanical instantons the tunneling events in quantum mechanics and monopoles instantons and instanton dyons in qfts in all those case large action was due to presumed small coupling appearing in inator s in all those cases there are bosonic zero modes induced by symmetries of the solutions like displacements scale change rotations zero modes correspond to non gaussian integrals those over collective coordinates were dened a general new feature is appearance of the delta function ensuring that quantum uctuations are orthogonal to all zero modes the jacobian generated by this delta function leads to new feynman diagrams not coming from the lagrangian march wspc book trim size for in in allinone summary while the amplitudes for quantum mechanical instantons has been calculated for a number of models up to loops for the qfts and gauge eld instantons the semiclassical theory has only been carried to the one loop determinant order in one case the static magnetic balls known as sphalerons there is a mode corresponding to instability of these solutions the classical solution corresponding to sphaleron decay in minkowski space time has also been discussed after i single soliton semiclassical amplitudes are established the next steps are ii calculation of the soliton interactions iii formulation of the partition function of their ensemble iv analytic or numerical integration over all collective coordinates the interaction can be of classical or quantum origin in general extrema of integrals are connected by certain lines streamlines or thimbles being lutions of the gradient ow equation containing the force we met three examples of those for instanton antiinstanton pairs in qm and gauge theory and for instanton dyon antidyon pairs in the dyon dyon case when classical tion is absent we also studied the quantum one loop interaction generated by the determinant in two soliton background signicant role in our discussion has been played by the fermionic zero modes for monopoles those are just bound states of fermions for qft instantons those lead to t hooft eective lagrangian in qcd with fermion legs and in troweak sector with quark and lepton left handed legs fermion induced forces between instantons can be considered as diagrams with this eective lagrangian the semiclassical theory denes amplitudes in a form of transseries menting perturbative series by terms of the order of const instanton series in g e as well as terms with exponent and powers of coming from the lines in qm applications certain resurgence relations are known relating series in powers of g for all these terms in qft case such relations are not yet known many cases for the usual integrals as well as the qm and qft settings it may require complexif ication of the paths congurations the notion of thimbles explains and generalizes the famous stokes phenomena known for the ordinary integrals and special functions and it is related to the phase transitions in the partition functions in qft and statistical mechanics settings all of them can be seen as thimble reconnections happening at some values of the parameters march wspc book trim size for in in allinone magnetic monopoles and the near tc qcd matter as a dual plasma magnetic monopoles and the near tc qcd matter as a dual plasma perhaps the most discussed soliton is the magnetic monopole while namical monopoles were never found in non abelian gauge theories they can exist the particular classical solution we discussed is the t hooft polyakov monopole recall that the setting was the georgi glashow model possessing the gauge eld and the adjoint scalar since adjoint scalars naturally appear in extended supersymmetric theories the monopoles were extensively studied in that setting recall that n symmetry forbid appearance of nonzero vacuum energy therefore vacua with ent vevs of the scalars are all degenerate and form the so called moduli space theory at weak coupling monopoles seiberg and witten has found that in the are heavier than electric w particles but at certain points the coupling goes to innity and monopole or dyon mass to zero the renormalization group ow connects those two limits smoothly so the same theory appear as weakly coupled non abelian theory with asymptotic freedom in one end of the moduli space and as weakly coupled dual magnetic electrodynamics with monopoles the dirac condition product of electric times the magnetic coupling must be an integer is preserved everywhere n fermions gluino and quarks have bound state with the monopoles if susy is unbroken those make certain supermultiplets these statement has been explicitly veried semiclasiscally the theory was the most important case it was found to be electric magnetic self dual this fact without any perturbative digramms calculated explains why it must have zero beta function it should be the same for g and g quarks in qcd also should be able to be bound to monopoles these issues are however not yet studied in any details n the monopoles in pure gauge and qcd like theories were studied extensively by lattice numerical simulations we know that their density increases toward tc and at t tc they form bose einstein condensate we discussed phenomenology of the hadronic matter near the qcd phase sition its thermo and kinetic properties related to heavy ion collision experiments at rhic and lhc colliders while the equation of state predicted by the lattice was well conrmed by hydro explosions the subsequent discoveries yield rather expected values of the kinetic coecients such as entropy density to sheer viscosity s ratio heavy quark diusion coecient d t and jet quenching parameter q t we argue further that all of them have rather peculiar t indicating extremely small mean free path of the matter constituents especially between tc and this transition is the deconnement transition rescattering between constituents is proportional to their densities yet the dimensionless densities of quarks and gluons nq g t rapidly decrease as ature goes down to critical value tc due to connement the only density which march wspc book trim size for in in allinone summary is peaked at tc is that of the magnetic monopoles nm this argument and more detailed calculations we discussed in that chapter indicate that signicant density of the particle monopoles is the most probable cause of the unusual sqgp kinetics observed experimentally in short qgp near tc seems to be a dual plasma containing a density of monopoles comparable to that of electric objects quarks and gluons a number of theoretical methods were used subsequently to study such dual plasmas from classical molecular dynamics to quantum cross section and kinetic theory to tum path integral monte carlo pimc those reproduce correlation functions of monopoles observed on the lattice in detail instanton dyons deconnement and chiral restoration phase transitions another version of non perturbative theory at t objects the instanton dyons tc is based on semiclassical incorporation of nonzero vev of the polyakov line called holonomy lead to a shift from studies of instantons to studies of their constituents instanton dyons or instanton monopoles recent papers on their ensembles done by a variety of methods we discussed in the previous chapter lead to very signicant advances unlike instantons these objects have three dierent set of charges topological magnetic and electric therefore back reacting on the holonomy potential the calculations showed that at suciently large density of the dyons the minimum of the free energy shifts to conning value of the holonomy at which the mean value of the polyakov line vanishes p this creates the so called symmetric phase in which all types of the dyons obtain equal actions and densities unlike instantons the dyons posess magnetic charges and thus their ensemble generates the magnetic screening mass recall that perturbative polarization tensor does not generate it shuryak but according to lattice data in the near tc region it even surpasses the electric mass while we have not discuss it above let me just mention that it clearly indicates a transition from electric qgp to magnetic plasma as the coupling grows with decreasing temperature further remarkable ndings were obtained using a very sensitive tool deforming qcd like theories with nonzero avor holonomies f also known as imaginary chemical potentials or modied periodicity phases the so called roberge weiss transitions originally postulated at high t only on perturbative grounds are no conrmed to be related with the hopping of quark zero modes from one type of dyon to the next a democratic distribution of avor holonomies corresponding to the so called qcd were shown to modify the phase transition in a very dramatic way deconnement transition is strengthened to the strong rst order transition while chiral symmetry restoration transition is weakened to become existing at all at any temperature march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the poisson duality between the monopole and the instanton dyon descriptions these nding complement another kind of deformed qcd in which quarks are substituted by adjoint gluinoes periodically compactied on matsubara circle the theory with one such gluino sym na preserves both connement and chiral symmetry breaking all the way to very small circle very high t eliminating phase transitions the theory with two such gluinoes shows even more spectacular behavior with phase transitions in the polyakov line and subsequent phases conned another deconned reconned all of them in the chirally broken phase n one should stress that avor holonomies constitute very soft modication of the theory in a periodicity condition on the matsubara circle all gluons and perturbative rg parameters of the theory remain unchanged and yet all phase it would be impossible to explain it using transitions are changed dramatically theory of instantons alone the number of their fermionic zero modes is dened solely by the topological charge and are insensitive to these holonomies while those changes appear natural in the framework of the instanton dyon theory so far no other known explanation of them exists it is a signicant challenge now to any other model of the deconnement and chiral transitions to explain these phenomena lut us even speculate that we are now perhaps approaching the point of no return at which the mechanism of the qcd phase transitions we discussed in this book is going to be nalized we also discuss lattice studies based on the so called fermion method to study underlying topology it is unmistakedly found to be the instanton dyons the classical model can be extensively checked on the lattice so far we see unexpectedly high accuracy of its predictions at least for the lowest dirac eigenstates the poisson duality between the monopole and the instanton dyon descriptions let us start with formulation of the physics behind this duality for a description of a thermal system of any particles one can adopt two well known strategies which produce two dierent forms of the partition function one may call them hamiltonian and lagrangian approaches needless to say they both describe the same system and thus must be identical while to show its equivalence explicitly is often dicult as they are simple in two opposite limits of low and high t it was in fact possible in certain highly symmetric examples to be discussed in this section the standard approach is to nd all the states of the system and perform h t it is working best at low temperatures the usual statistical sum t where only some lowest states needs to be included the approach is to go to euclidean formulation and evaluating the partition sum using the path integral over the paths periodic in the matsubara time those can be classied by their winding number also known as bec cluster number march wspc book trim size for in in allinone summary this approach works best at high t or small matsubara circumference t in which case the paths with zero winding number dominate in order to see how these two approaches work for monopoles one needs a setting in which both the monopoles and instanton dyons are well dened semiclassical objects convenient settings thus include theories with extended supersymmetry because those have scalar elds and t hooft polyakov monopoles both of these theories attracted a lot of theorist s attention in the s some of that will be useful for our current goal which can be formulated as getting some understanding on inter relation between the physics of particle monopoles and instanton dyons in section we had discussed qcd with two or more adjoint gluinos by adding appropriate number of scalars those theories can be upgraded to theories with extended supersymmetry specically adding one complex scalar a to the sym and by adding scalars to the na theory na theory one gets one gets sym by n dorey and collaborators dorey dorey and parnachev chen et al and then also for sym by poppitz and unsal poppitz and unsal sym this has been done in literature rst for n n n what is common to all those papers is that they start by compactifying one of the dimensions to a circle of a circumference in contrast to the thermal theory however the gluino elds are assumed to be periodic on this circle and therefore the supersymmetry is not going to be broken we will still call this direction the th one furthermore the compactication allows one to dene two holonomies the polyakov loop with the eld and the magnetic eld with a dual magnetic potential dorey et al call those and respectively and their vevs can be considered two main parameters of the settings together with in order to make the discussion simpler one assumes the minimal number of colors nc in which there is only one diagonal generator breaking su so these vev s and are just parameters on top of that the theory is in the so called coulomb branch which means that on top of the holonomies and one or more of available scalars is also assumed to have a nonzero vev called for the same color diagonal component this of course leads to monopoles with the action n n sm including the contribution from the scalar vev electric holonomy and the winding number of the path in the circle n the n term is what we called above the m instanton dyon the n the l dyon and higher n correspond to the paths with stronger time dependent twists we would not derive the partition dorey et al also discussed two brane constructions corresponding to two poisson dual mulations which we would not discuss here march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the poisson duality between the monopole and the instanton dyon descriptions but just present the resulting expression zinst m exp ik km km where m the bps monopole mass without holonomies and thus the second term in exponent is interpreted as just the boltzmann factor the index is the magnetic charge of the conguration note that it appears in the exponent times the magnetic holonomy and since k is an integer the expression is periodic in with the period as it should the second index n is the winding number of the path in the circle note that all values of n need to be included in the sum because z should be periodic in the electric holonomy as well as in finally note that the last term of the exponent has unusual position of or temperature in the numerator the sum over n therefore converges better at small high t limit now we switch to other description which is better convergent in the opposite case of large and low t it operates with states of motion of monopoles in its collective coordinates three of those are locations of the monopole and are included in trivial way the fourth collective coordinate is the angle of monopole color rotation which preserves the holonomy dened on another circle therefore the problem includes a quantum rotator as was explained by julia and zee the corresponding integer angular momentum q is nothing but the electric charge of the rotating monopole the partition function looks in this approach as follows zmono m iq km now both holonomies appear with appropriate integers so the periodicity in is as required the last term in exponent is due to the kinetic energy of the rotation with angular momentum squared and the rest being nothing else but the momentum of inertia of the monopole in denominator note also that or temperature is in this term in the usual thermal position so that the sum in zmono is more suppressed at higher or lower temperature we have copied those expressions from the original work in order to demonstrate the key statement of this section pointed out by dorey and called the poisson ity the two seemingly dierent expressions addressing seemingly dierent motions in two dierent circles do in fact lead to the same partition function zinst zmono simplify it here a bit compared to the original paper by putting one more external parameter of the setting the cp odd angle to zero march wspc book trim size for in in allinone summary indeed performing the sum over q in the latter expression the discrete fourier transform of a gaussian one gets the so called periodic gaussian given by the sum over n in the former expression in fact both expressions generate the same function let us understand why it is so the rst exponents outside of the sums are the same for obvious reasons the masses of the particle monopole and instanton dyon are the same as so are their magnetic charge thus ei to understand what is happening with the sums let us simplify the issue to the simplest problem possible in this case a particle moving in a circle thermal euclidean time theory is thus dened on two circles the low t theory starts with dening the spectrum of excitations as usual since there is no dependence on the position on the circle the angular momentum l is conserved commutes with the hamiltonian and the excited states are numerated by it the spectrum of a rotator is el where m is the particle mass and r is the circle radius furthermore if there is a magnetic ux through the circle so that our particle gets the aharonov bohm phase the spectrum shifts to el l the partition function is z el t the dual description at high t describe paths of the particle in terms of how many times it is winding around the circle at high t the thermal circle is very short so most of the periodic paths would be approximately time independent but as the thermal circle gets longer there appear paths in which a particle rotates by additional times around the spatial circle it is not dicult to calculate the action for such paths and get another representation for z better converging at high t since both descriptions correspond to the same quantum mechanical problem one should not be surprised that both of them give the same z l exp the next step was to apply this poisson duality to qcd calculating semiclassical sum with all winding numbers into the monopole like identical sum what was found is that in the qcd case the monopole action is s and thus the density exp s this explains long known lattice data on the monopole density it also tells us that in pure gauge and qcd like theories the monopoles are not classical objects the qcd vacuum and correlation functions instantons i was asked many times why the topic of gauge topology needs to be studied in view of the fact that lattice gauge theories include automatically all of these objects anyway why do we need any dedicated studies of these degrees of freedom and eective models in view of the fact that lattice gauge theory simulations do reproduce the hadronic spectrum equation of state of thermal hadronic matter march wspc book trim size for in in allinone the qcd vacuum and correlation functions instantons and many other observables the answer is that degrees of freedom associated with topological objects are much more important than millions other degrees of freedom simulated by modern supercomputers the rst answer is that the topological solitons have zero modes which translate them into eective multi fermion operators without any idea about topology and understanding of the corresponding the index theorems and these zero modes themselves it would be probably next to impossible to gure out where these interaction between quarks come from it is very important that topology induced interaction between quarks are in fact the strongest forces shaping the observed hadronic spectrum it is this action which makes pions near massless and quite light while and meson we called are nearly as heavy as the nucleon gev gev we systematically studied the qcd point to point correlation functions in the corresponding chapter and had shown how their splitting develops as a function of the distance between the operators probing the qcd vacuum and have seen that they are indeed stem from the topology induced eective t hooft lagrangian moreover the distances at which such non perturbative phenomena turns out to be rather small indicated that these topologically nontrivial gauge elds are rather strong they are even more important for spin zero gluonic operators dominating the perturbative eects and thus limiting any pqcd applications for momentum transfer gev we have shown above that the gauge topology is key to understanding of the su nf and u chiral symmetries lattice practitioners know well the banks relation relating the density of the dirac eigenvalues near zero to the quark condensate much less widely known is the notion of the zero modes zone zmz a thin layer of dirac eigenvalues made out of collectivized zero modes all textbooks repeat the standard notion of the light quark masses mu md ms as being much smaller compared to some strong coupling scale qcd and thus justifying a taylor expansion in their powers in reality many masses used on the lattice are actually comparable to the zmz width as a result lattice practitioners continue to be surprised by large deviations from linear chiral perturbation theory for quark masses they routinely use the reason for that is an observation quite elementary in terms of instanton ensembles and going back to early s that the hopping matrix elements for quark jumping between topological solitons and thus the width of the zmz are of the order of only m ev an order of magnitude smaller than qcd the reason the zmz so small width is also of the topological origin no matter how small or large are perturbations of the solitons their topology remains march wspc book trim size for in in allinone summary valued and their zero modes remains unperturbed at zero dirac eigenvalues the only eect which does perturb them is a presence of another topological anti soliton nearby finally about some practical eects of topology modern supercomputers ulate path integrals qcd like gauge theories with millions of variables and yet the results such as correlation functions hadronic masses and other properties are still subject of large uctuations from conguration to conguration also some observables e mean topological charge q may show nonzero values in contradiction to cp invariance of the theory the reason for both phenomena is the fact that local update algorithms used are notoriously inecient in updating the topology of the congurations this can in principle be improved by new gorithms able to identify create destroy the topological objects and appropriately update their collective coordinates furthermore even the largest simulated umes contain only topological solitons not a very large number outlook finally let us at least enumerate some important issues which for various reasons was not discussed above one of the goals of the book was to help to bridge an existing gap between two communities which can be loosely called following hep th and hep ph arxiv nomination as the phenomenologists lattice hadron spectra hadron properties quark gluon plasma and hard theorists supersymmetric theories string theory holographic dualities unfortunately the communication between them is weak as we emphasized repeatedly from the introduction topological solitons are not just some cute exotic objects from a mathematical zoo their ensembles have ous phases many of which are or may be in future important for very practical plications the vortices in type ii superconductors need to be in a crystalline form to produce good industrial magnets the density of monopoles or instanton dyons should be sucient to generate color connement and chiral symmetry breaking we also discussed evidences that an interplay between electrically and magnetically charged quasiparticles are at the hard of unusual kinetics of quark gluon plasma sphaleron transitions provide chiral imbalance in matter driving a non dissipative current due to chiral magnetic eect now extending into condense matter cations and perhaps even into electronics the instanton induced multi fermion interactions generate the so called color superconductivity expected to dominate thermodynamics and kinetics of the dense matter deep inside the neutron stars on the theory side interest to electric magnetic duality has been superseded at the end of by the holographic dualities of the ads cft type originally found for conformal sym it has been extended by softly broken metry to and so on the seiberg witten elliptic curve has been reformulated in terms of certain brane constructions while the top down holography extension n n march wspc book

is its square called centrifugal potential i enters laplace bertrami operator of the laplacian producing the so li i xk vl in dimensions the group of rotations has generators there exist a standard formalism with total angular momentum and dierent angular functions for each dimension in math literature but we would not follow it here instead we will view these generators as two pairs of or su algebras much more familiar to us often these two are called left and right handed sets of angular momenta in taking this road one has to face a certain dilemma one can either keep i the standard normalization of the angular momentum or the standard form of the su commutation relation following t hooft we use the latter choice dening these two pairs of angular momenta operators by a a la i ax x la i ax x la plb q p which do not have standard normalization due to extra but commute in the standard way namely note that pq indicate that two sets are mutually commuting note extra in denition of compared to standard quantum mechanics in it leads to extra factor in angular part of the laplacian with it the radial equation adds the centrifugal potential of the form these notations imply that

of fermion elds into the path integral needs special denitions priate for grassmannian anti commuting variables those have been dened in a classic work berezin and is discussed in any modern textbook on qfts additional subtleties appear with its transformation into the euclidean space time in which q and q must be treated as independent variables i have to explain in what sense the integral over should be dened it is a fermionic variable not just the ordinary eld they are called grassman variables or anti commuting ones in particular for such variables one has which represents the pauli principle these variables have funny rules for the integrals they are given essentially by two basic integrals b b b d d one can then derive the following formula exp kmk dn dn detm which can be proved in the eigenvector basis by decomposition of the exponent note that the ordinary gaussian integral with n variables of such type is equal to exp l kmk dn detm and the determinant stands in the denominator so if one of the eigenvalues is zero the fermionic integral vanishes while in the corresponding bosonic one diverges note also in passing that one fermionic integral can compensate two bosonic ones if the eigenvalue spectra happen to be equal this comment is important for supersymmetric theories in which fermionic and bosonic integrals do indeed compensate each other in the vacuum energy and many other observables fortunately all of the above can be bypassed because a general integration over the fermions in qcd can be made in a simple form because those appear in the action only linearly the schematic master formula for it is d q b where m is in general a matrix in all fermionic indices and also possibly a dierential in qcd m id is the dirac operator with the color matrix in covariant derivative obviously in fundamental representation the nal comment as the operator i d is hermitian its eigenvalues are all real however one may to prove it imagine that the operator is diagonalized the exponent is expanded and the pauli principle in the form holds march wspc book trim size for in in allinone quark elds still ask how it happens that at non zero mass entering with i in the euclidean formulation and non positive the ratio of the determinants happen to be positive otherwise one can not use probability language we noticed that the former dirac operator is hermitian therefore its eigenvalues are real due to chiral symmetry they go in pairs and therefore we have always i m i m so this factor is real too and even has denite sign and can be with proper denition made positive this is important as we want to prescribe to it the meaning of the probability of occurrence of the corresponding conguration in the vacuum b quark elds we denote

is z dexp se sf e march wspc book trim size for in in allinone appendix c perturbative qcd c renormalization group and asymptotic freedom a systematic approach using continuous renormalization group rg has been veloped originally in gell mann and low and describes the renormalization of the charge as a function of momentum scale they introduced the so called beta function dened as the charge derivative over the scale magnitude at which it is dened c c c if the beta function is known this eqn can be integrated g log log g for small coupling values the beta function can be determined perturbatively and its standard denition includes the so called rst and second beta function coecients which are computed from one and two loop diagrams let us consider a number of examples with dierent beta functions see fig c example a very special class of qfts are conf ormal cft in those theories and the coupling is independent of the scale the famous example in is supersymmetric gluodynamics it has kinds of gluinos and scalars and their contributions to the beta function cancel that of the gluons order by order this theory was studied in and was historically central for a discovery of the so called ads cft duality n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone perturbative qcd fig c schematic behavior of the beta functions in the examples considered a qed second order phase transition c qcd and qcd with suciently large number of light avors ir and uv with arrows indicate direction of the charge motion at small and large momenta respectively example quantum electrodynamics qed is the rst qft studied since s in one loop the so called vacuum polarization diagram leads to the following answer the solution for the charge vs scale is therefore c c and when grows the charge is measured deeper inside the electron at distances it appears larger eventually one nds zero of the denominator the so called landau pole where the formula tells us the charge is innite before taking this answer at its face value one should be reminded that the formula has applicability limitations and already when the coupling becomes of the order we can not any more trust any perturbative results what actually happens in qed at such small distances remains unclear qed might be the rst qft studied but by no means it is a well dened theory it lacks any non perturbative denition therefore one can not answer or even in principle formulate how to answer many questions example the second order phase transitions or scalar theories in dimensions in this case the beta function changes sign and has a zero at g the xed point so when the coupling reaches this value its running stops assuming that close to its zero it can be approximated by a linear function g one nds power like dependence near the xed point g c march wspc book trim size for in in allinone renormalization group and asymptotic freedom example qcd like gauge theories have the so called ultraviolet xed point near which the coupling is small c c c c with positive where nc nf are the number of colors and quark avors both can be taken to be in qcd positivity of the rst coecient of rg beta function behavior is also known as asymptotic freedom its rst published version for nc nf was obtained in khriplovich using coulomb gauge quantization in gross and wilczek politzer have not only obtained this result in covariant gauges but more importantly they related this feature with the experimentally observed in dis at slac weakly interacting point like quarks suggesting that the fundamental theory of strong interactions quantum chromodynamics describe it integrating the beta function one has the explicit asymptotic freedom formula and at large small distances the charge goes to zero there is less and less color charge deep inside the quarks the expression can be written as lqcd where the constant is traded for a dimensional one qcd giving to the strong interaction theory its natural scale example the qcd like theories close to the line have both infrared and ultraviolet xed points banks and zaks the expression for the second two loop coecient is nf c and so when for example in a theory with nc colors and nf avors is negative putting expressions for b to the denition of the beta function one nds that it possesses a zero xed point at c march wspc book trim size for in in allinone perturbative qcd note that it is small if is small in this case the charge is always small therefore hadrons can not exist and the correlation functions have power like rather than exponential decrease with the distance studies of this conformal regime at zero and nonzero temperatures require to handle many quark species and therefore they only recently became available to lattice practitioners due to advances in computing there evidences that qcd with nc colors and nf avors is already in this regime we will not discuss this interesting subject any more since it is too close to the cutting edge of supercomputer ability at the time of this writing for supersymmetric theories it has been suggested that rather than calculate beta function in vacuum one can rather nd it from calculation of the instanton amplitude we have discussed the so called nsvz beta function in section c gross pisarski yae one loop free energy for nonzero omy the notations used in their paper gross et al for the th component of the gauge potential on the matsubara circle of circumference are diag q c so their variables qi nc are related to the phase fractions we use just by i note further that

identities allowing to rewrite multi fermion operators in dierent forms for four fermion operators written as product of two neutral brackets meaning all indices dirac color and avor convoluted inside

relations follow from the identity ikta ta jl ikjl ilkj in original papers and textbooks validity of this and other identities is usually proven by doing multiple convolutions e with ikjl or ijkl plus some additional considerations which force us to think too much nowadays one can check them in seconds directly using mathematica indeed the l s and r s are index tables with just components so there is no problem to calculate them d march wspc book trim size for in in allinone instanton related formulae all for both sides one indeed nds that all of them are the same namely in mathematica table notations with i j k l order the somewhat simplied form of such relations are often used in which matrices are mentioned without explicit indices for example the relation given above can be rewritten using such notations as d d direct another relation of the type is ta cross ta ta direct ta ta cross and using both one can transfer any expression contaning color convolution from one channel to the next let me add that so far no assumptions about open indices were made but sometimes their symmetry is known simplifying relations further for example if the cross channel combines two quarks diquark in the baryon we know that in this case only antisymmetric color indices are allowed then in the r s out of matrices ta only three ones which are antisymmetric ta anti produce nonzero contributions quark isospin matrices are related to su generators pauli matrices a a divided by two of course those coinside with the rst three gell mann generators here are corresponding relation for pauli matrices direct a a cross a a direct a a cross d d in diquark channel with isospin zero and antisymmetric indices in cross channel there remains only one anstisymmetric pauli matrix so r s in this

for in in allinone instanton related formulae march wspc book trim size for in in allinone appendix e some special theories e gauge theory with the exceptional group interest to this particular theory is related with the question of whether the zn symmetry of the su n gauge theories is or is not related to connement the answer is not at all the construction starts with the group which has generators and rank real matrices satisfy as for any so group its is its subgroup which additionally satisfy more relations det t tabc tdef daebf e e where t is an antisymmetric tensor such that e in

nontrivial center only the unit matrix commutes with all generators therefore there is no spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry in the deconned phase e sym and sqcd and their seiberg witten solution n the and corresponding susy qcd theories will be discussed only in one ter on instanton dyons this is how the puzzle of quark condensate was resolved n march wspc book trim size for in in allinone some special theories in general these theories have properties similar to ordinary qcd therefore we just jump to progress was more n and then theories in which theoretical n e the eld content and rg ows let us start with the eld content of those theories the gluodynamics or super yang mills sym theory has gluons spin two real gluinoes spin and a complex scalar spin which we will call a each of them has two degrees of freedom thus bosonic and fermionic ones n n the qcd is a theory with additional matter supermultiplets of structure f with spin and respectively we will call nf

multiplet this branch is called the coulomb branch however if both a higgsing is like in the weinberg salam model with all gluons massive this is called the higgs branch the coupling renormalization in these theories is done only via the one loop beta function with the coecient nf e while two loop and higher coecients vanish the explanation for that was given in the instanton chapter see nsvz beta function start with nf or at the opposite end at nf qcd one nds zero beta function and is thus sym n a conformal theory we will not discuss it e the moduli supersymmetry also require that for any value of v the vacuum energy remains zero thus there is a whole manyfold of non equivalent vacua known as moduli space labeled by a complex number v all properties of the system are expressed as derivatives of one fundamental holomorphic function f u in particularly the eective charge and the theta angle are combined into a variable which is given by its second derivative u u e ts general

with its instanton based description the map of the moduli space is sckematically given in fig e there are three distinct patches on the v plane there is a perturbative patch in which the coupling i at large values of v is weak it is dominated by electric particles gluons gluinoes and higgses with small masses which determine the beta function monopoles have large masses there and can be treated semiclassically a magnetic patch around the v point in which the coupling is innitely strong the monopole mass goes to zero as well as the magnetic charge g iii a dyonic patch around the v electric and magnetic charges both being gets massless point in which a dyon particle with e e singularities for qcd n n let us now focus on the next case nf here are the limiting cases discussed by seiberg witten suppose rst the quark squark triplet has large mass m this means that one needs large value of the vev a to cancel it the structure of the a plane is as follows two original singular points inherited from nf or sym plus a triply degenerate singularity at large a as mf one by one one may reason what happens see details in the second seiberg witten paper when the process is complete they came up with the following unusual structure a degenerate zero where monopoles nm ne get massless plus another single zero where some particle with nm ne gets massless the former quartet of monopoles includes zero mode by one quark plus perhaps the old unoccuplied monopole the singularity existing before march wspc book trim size for in in allinone some special theories the latter nm ne state is some kind of di monopole bound state bound by quarks its possible nature has been discussed at the end of the monopole chapter e super yang mills theory n as the name suggests it has supersymmetries and thus fermions have avor or r charge index i on top of assumed adjoint color index this makes fermionic degrees of freedom compensated by polarizations of the gauge eld and complex scalars ij in corresponding representation of the r charge the usual cancellations between bosonic and fermionic loops follow this remarkable theory has been called a harmonic oscillator of the st as follows from nsvz beta function derived from instanton above in this case bosonic and fermionic parts of beta function cancel to all loops and thus it is a super conformal theory the charge keeps its value independent of the scale it is due to this remarkable high symmetry of this theory and to j maldacena of course that we now have ads cft holographic correspondence we already discussed another derivation of this fact from electric magnetic ality in the monopole chapter the monopole dressed by all types of gluinoes make and objects which together form precisely a tiplet so its magnetic theory with charge g is the same as the electric theory with charge g beta functions must be the same for electric and magnetic theory up to a sign the only possible solution is that it is identically

boundary agators those were constructed in witten in the following way the agator is a scalar eld of a point charge placed somewhere in the space under consideration clearly the simplest case is when we put this charge at the origin in this case no dependence on xi i is expected by of the space symmetry and so one can keep only the z part of the laplacian considering the massless case for simplicity we only have one term in the equation f f f f and the only solution which vanishes at is dz z zd it is singular at z show it is exactly the right delta function as of course it should as there is a source there one can the next step is to use conformal invariance and move the source to a place we actually want it to be namely at the boundary this is done by the conformal transformation which moves the source to the point xi and changes the solution to xi xi z d all what remains is to shift the point to arbitrary location by xi nding the normalization constant xi i and for more complete discussion of propagators we suggest danielsson et al we will not copy its beginning with a concise description of what vacuum one should select in ads curved space yet it is worth
