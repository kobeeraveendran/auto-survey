indispensable tool abstracts summaries document surrogates place original documents way summaries help reader quick overview entire document important issue related information explosion internet problem documents similar topics duplicated kind data duplication problem increases necessity effective document summarization summary following important reasons support automatic text summarization summary abstract saves reading time summary abstract facilitate document selection literature searches improves document indexing efficiency machine generated summary free bias customized summaries useful question answering systems provide personalized information use automatic semi automatic summarization commercial abstract services allow scale number published texts evaluate input
