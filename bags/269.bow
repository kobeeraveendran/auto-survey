enhancing factual consistency of abstractive summarization chenguang william ruochen qingkai michael xuedong meng microsoft cognitive services group university of notre dame chezhu wihintho ruox nzeng edu r a m l c s c v v i x r a abstract automatic abstractive summaries are found to often distort or fabricate facts in the article this inconsistency between summary and inal text has seriously impacted its ity we propose a fact aware summarization model fasum to extract and integrate factual relations into the summary generation process via graph attention we then design a factual corrector model fc to automatically correct factual errors from summaries generated by isting systems empirical show that the fact aware summarization can produce stractive summaries with higher factual tency compared with existing systems and the correction model improves the factual tency of given summaries via modifying only a few keywords introduction text summarization models aim to produce an abridged version of long text while preserving salient information abstractive summarization is a type of such models that can freely generate maries with no constraint on the words or phrases used this format is closer to human edited maries and is both exible and informative thus there are numerous approaches to produce tive summaries see et al paulus et al dong et al gehrmann et al however one prominent issue with abstractive summarization is factual inconsistency it refers to the hallucination phenomenon that the summary sometimes distorts or fabricates the facts in the article recent studies show that up to of the summaries generated by abstractive models contain such factual inconsistencies kryscinski et al falke et al raising concerns about the credibility and usability of these systems article bottomup fasum ours real madrid ace gareth bale treated himself to a sunday evening bbq the welsh wizard was scoring twice and assisting another in an impressive victory cristiano ronaldo scored ve goals against granada on sunday the real madrid ace scored ve goals against granada on sunday the welsh wizard was in impressive form for gareth bale scored ve and assisted another in an impressive win in israel gareth bale scored twice and helped his side to a sensational win cristiano ronaldo scored ve goals against granada on sunday table example article and summary excerpts from cnn dailymail dataset table demonstrates an example article and cerpts of generated summaries as shown the ticle mentions that real madrid ace gareth bale scored twice and cristiano ronaldo scored ve goals however both bottomup gehrmann et al and wrongly states that bale scored ve goals comparatively our model fasum generates a summary that correctly hibits the fact in the article and as shown in tion our model achieves higher factual sistency not just by making more copies from the article on the other hand most existing abstractive marization models apply a conditional language model to focus on the token level accuracy of summaries while neglecting semantic level tency between the summary and article therefore the generated summaries are often high in level metrics like rouge lin but lack factual consistency in view of this we argue that a robust abstractive summarization system must be equipped with factual knowledge to accurately summarize the article provide the prediction results of all models at https com in this paper we represent facts in the form of knowledge graphs although there are numerous the ame of remembrance burns in jerusalem and a song of memory haunts valerie braham as it never has before this year israel s memorial day commemoration is for bereaved family members such as braham now i truly understand everyone who has lost a loved one braham said her husband philippe braham was one of people killed in january s terror attacks in paris as israel mourns on the nation s remembrance day french prime minister manuel valls announced after his weekly cabinet meeting that french authorities had foiled a terror plot valerie braham was one of people killed in january s terror attacks in paris france s memorial day commemoration is for bereaved family members as braham israel s prime minister says the terror plot has not been done philippe braham was one of people killed in january s terror attacks in paris israel s memorial day commemoration is for bereaved family members as braham france s prime minister says the terror plot has not been done article bottomup corrected by fc table example excerpts of an article from cnn dailymail and the summary generated by bottomup factual errors are marked in red the correction made by our model fc are marked in green efforts in building commonly applicable knowledge graphs such as conceptnet speer et al we nd that these tools are more useful in conferring commonsense knowledge in abstractive rization for contents like news articles many ties and relations are previously unseen plus our goal is to produce summaries that do not conict with the facts in the article thus we propose to extract factual knowledge from the article itself we employ the information extraction ie tool openie angeli et al to extract facts from the article in the form of relational tuples subject relation object this graph contains the facts in the article and is integrated in the summary tion process then we use a graph attention network velickovic et al to obtain the representation of each node and fuse that into a transformer based encoder decoder architecture via attention we note this model as the fact aware summarization model fasum in addition to be generally applicable for all existing summarization systems we propose a tual corrector model fc to help improve the tual consistency of any given summary we frame the correction process as a problem the put is the original summary and the article and the output is the corrected summary fc has the same architecture as unilm dong et al and tialized with weights from roberta large liu et al we netune it as a denoising coder the training data is synthetically generated via randomly replacing entities in the ground truth summary with wrong ones in the article as shown in table fc makes three corrections replacing the original wrong entities which appear elsewhere in the article with the right ones in the experiments we leverage an dently trained bert based devlin et al factual consistency evaluator kryscinski et al results show that on cnn dailymail sum obtains higher fact consistency scores than unilm dong et al and higher than bottomup gehrmann et al over after correction by fc the factual score of summaries from bottomup increases on cnn dailymail and on xsum and the score of summaries from increases on xsum we also conduct human evaluation to verify the effectiveness of our models we further propose an easy to compute free metric relation matching rate rmr to uate factual consistency given a summary and the article this metric employs the extracted relations and does not require human labelled summaries under this metric we show that our models can help enhance the factual consistency of summaries related work abstractive summarization abstractive text summarization has been sively studied in recent literature rush et al introduces an attention based model for stractive sentence summarization see et al uses copy generate mechanism that can both duce words from the vocabulary via a generator and copy words from the article via a pointer paulus et al leverages reinforcement learning to improve summarization quality gehrmann et al uses a content selector to over determine phrases in source documents that helps constrain the model to likely phrases zhu et al denes a pretraining scheme for summarization and produces a zero shot abstractive tion model dong et al employs different masking techniques for both nlu and nlg tasks resulting in the unilm model lewis et al employs denoising techniques to help generation tasks including summarization fact aware summarization entailment models have been used to evaluate and enhance factual consistency of summarization li et al co trains summarization and ment and employs an entailment aware decoder falke et al proposes using off the shelf entailment models to rerank candidate summary sentences to boost factual consistency zhang et al employs descriptor vectors to improve factual consistency in medical rization cao et al extracts relational mation from the article and maps it to a sequence as an additional input to the encoder gunel et al employs an entity aware transformer ture for knowledge integration and matsumaru et al improves factual consistency of erated headlines by ltering out training data with more factual errors in comparison our model lizes the knowledge graph extracted from the article and fuses it into the generated text via neural graph computation to correct factual errors dong et al uses pre trained nlu models to rectify one or more wrong entities in the summary concurrent to our work cao et al employs the generation model bart lewis et al to produce rected summaries several approaches have been proposed to uate a summary s factual consistency kryscinski et al goodrich et al maynez et al zhang et al employs bert to compute similarity between pairs of words in the summary and article wang et al mus et al use question answering accuracy to measure factual consistency kryscinski et al applies various transformations on the mary to produce training data for a bert based classication model factcc which shows a high correlation with human metrics therefore we use factcc as the factual evaluator in this paper model problem formulation we formalize abstractive summarization as a supervised problem the input sists of a pairs of articles and summaries xa ya each article is tokenized into xi xli and each summary is tokenized into yi in abstrative summarization the model generated summary can contain tokens phrases and tences not present in the article for ity in the following we will drop the data dex subscript therefore each training pair comes x xm y and the model needs to generate an abstrative summary fact aware summarizer we propose the fact aware abstractive rizer fasum it utilizes the architecture built upon transformers vaswani et al in detail the encoder produces contextualized dings of the article and the decoder attends to the encoder s output to generate the summary to make the summarization model fact aware we extract represent and integrate knowledge from the source article into the summary generation cess which is described in the following the all architecture of fasum is shown in figure knowledge extraction to extract important entity relation information from the article we employ the stanford openie tool angeli et al the extracted knowledge is a list of tuples each tuple contains a subject s a relation r and an object o each as a segment of text from the article in the experiments there are on average tuples extracted per article in cnn dailymail hermann et al and tuples in xsum narayan et al knowledge representation we construct a knowledge graph to represent the information extracted from openie we apply the levi transformation levi to treat each entity and relation equally in detail suppose a tuple is s r o we create nodes s r and o and add edges r and o in this way we obtain an rected knowledge graph g v e where each node v v is associated with text during training this graph g is constructed for each batch individually i e there s no shared huge graph one benet is that the model can take unseen entities and relations during inference we then employ a graph attention network velickovic et al to obtain embedding ej for each node vj the initial embedding of vj is given by the last hidden state of a bidirectional lstm figure the model architecture of fasum it has l layers of transformer blocks in both the encoder and decoder the knowledge graph is obtained from information extraction results and it participates in the decoder s attention applied to in the experiment we employ graph attention layers knowledge integration the knowledge graph embedding is obtained in allel with the encoder then apart from the cal cross attention over the encoder s outputs each decoder block also computes cross attention over the knowlege graph nodes embeddings ij jv i ej ij st ui ijej jv where graph nodes and representation of the rst t generated tokens are the nal embeddings of the are the decoder block summary generation we denote the nal output of the decoder as zt to produce the next token we ploy a linear layer w to project zt to a vector of the same size of the dictionary and the predicted distribution of is obtained by zt during training we use cross entropy as the loss function t where yt is yt the one hot vector for the t token and sent the parameters in the network fact corrector to better utilize existing summarization systems we propose a factual corrector model fc to prove the factual consistency of any summary erated by abstractive systems fc frames the rection process as a problem given an article and a candidate summary the model ates a corrected summary with minimal changes to be more factually consistent with the article while fasum has a graph attention module in the transformer preventing direct adaptation from pre trained models the fc model ture adopts the design of the pre trained model unilm dong et al we initiailized the model weights from roberta large liu et al the netuning process is similar to training a denoising autoencoder we use back translation and entity swap for synthetic data generation for example an entity in the ground truth summary is randomly replaced with another entity of the same type from the article this modied summary and the article is sent to the corrector to recover the original

tokensgraph attn netbilstminformation articlelevi ated m data samples in cnn dailymail and k samples in xsum for netuning we take k samples in each dataset for validation and use the rest for training during inference the candidate summary from any abstractive summarization system is nated with the article and sent to fc which duces the corrected summary experiments datasets we evaluate our model on benchmark rization datasets cnn dailymail hermann et al and xsum narayan et al they contain k and k news articles and edited summaries respectively covering different topics and various summarization styles implementation details we use the huggingface s wolf et al plementation of transformer in bart lewis et al we also inherit their provided eters of cnn dailymail and xsum for the beam search the minimum summary length is and for cnn daily mail and xsum respectively the number of beams is for cnn dailymail and for xsum in fasum both the encoder and decoder has layers of heads for attention teacher forcing is used in training we use adam kingma and ba as the optimizer with a learning rate of the bi lstm to produce the initial embedding of graph nodes has a hidden state of size and the graph attention network gat has heads and a hidden state of size the dropout rate is in gat and elsewhere we use the subword tokenizer sentencepiece kudo and richardson the dictionary is shared across all the datasets the vocabulary has a size of k and a dimension of the correction model fc follows the unilm dong et al architecture initialized with weights from roberta large liu et al we ne tune the model for epochs with a learning rate of and linear warmup over the of total steps and linear decay during decoding it uses beam search with a width of and blocks gram duplicates the batch size during netuning is more details are presented in the appendix metrics to evaluate factual consistency we re implemented and trained the factcc model kryscinski et al the model outputs a score between and where a higher score indicates better consistency between the input article and summary the ing of factcc is independent of our summarizer so no parameters are shared more details are in the appendix we also employ the standard and rouge l metrics lin to measure summary qualities these three metrics evaluate the accuracy on unigrams bigrams and the longest common subsequence we report the rouge scores in all experiments and the rouge l score on validation set is used to pick the best model for both fasum and fc baselines the following abstractive summarization models are selected as baseline systems narayan et al is based on topic modeling and convolutional neural networks bottomup gehrmann et al uses a bottom up approach to generate summarization unilm dong et al utilizes large scale pretraining to produce state of the art abstractive summaries we train the baseline models when the predictions are not available in their open source repositories results as shown in table our model performs all baseline systems in factual tency scores in cnn dailymail and is only hind unilm in xsum in cnn dailymail sum is higher than unilm and higher than bottomup in factual score statistical test shows that the lead is statistically signicant with value smaller than the higher factual score of unilm among baselines corroborates the ndings in maynez et al that pre trained models hibit better factuality but our proposed knowledge graph component can help the train from scratch fasum model to excel in factual consistency we conduct ablation study to remove the edge graph component from fasum resulting in the model as shown there is a clear drop in factual score in cnn dailymail and in xsum this proves that the constructed have put code and all the generated summaries of all models in the supplementary materials knowledge graph can help increase the factual rectess of the generated summaries it s worth noticing that the rouge metric does not always reect the factual consistency times even showing an inverse relationship a nomenon observed in multiple studies kryscinski et al maynez et al for instance although bottomup has higher points than fasum in cnn dailymail there are many factual errors in its summaries as shown in the human evaluation on the other hand to make sure the improved factual correctness of our els is not achieved by simply copying insignicant information from the article we conduct analysis on abstractiveness in section and human uation in section furthermore the correction model fc can fectively enhance the factual consistency of maries generated by various baseline models cially when the original summary has a relatively low factual consistency for instance on cnn dm the factual score of bottomup increases by after correction on xsum after correction the factual scores increase by to for all line models interestingly fc can also boost the factual consistency of our fasum model more the correction has a rather small impact on the rouge score and it can improve the rouge scores of most models in xsum dataset we check and nd that fc only makes modest modications necessary to the original summaries for instance fc modies of summaries erated by bottomup in cnn dailymail these modied summaries contain very few changed kens of these corrected summaries contain or fewer new tokens while the summaries have on average tokens in the appendix of supplementary materials we show several examples of summaries given by sum and corrected by fc to demonstrate the proved factual consistency of summarization insights novel n grams it has been shown in durmus et al that less abstractive summaries are more factual consistent with the article therefore we inspect whether our models boost factual consistency simply by copying more portions of the article on xsum s testset we compute the ratio of novel n grams in summaries that do not appear figure percentage of novel n grams for summaries in xsum test set in the article figure shows that fasum achieves the closest ratio of novel n gram compared with reference summaries and higher than bottomup and unilm this demonstrates that fasum can produce highly abstractive summaries while ing factual consistency relation matching rate while the factual consistency evaluator factcc kryscinski et al is based on pre trained models it requires netuning on articles and belled summaries furthermore we empirically nd that the performance of factcc degrades when it is netuned on one summary dataset and used to evaluate models on another dataset therefore in this subsection we design an to compute model free factual consistency metric which can be used when ground truth summaries are not available as the relational tuples in the knowledge graph capture the factual information in the text we pute the precision of extracted tuples in the mary in detail suppose the set of the relational tuples in the summary is rs ri oi and the set of the relational tuples in the article is ra then each tuple in rs falls into one of the ing three categories correct hit c ri oi ra wrong hit w ri oi ra but oi ri ra or ri oi ra miss m otherwise we dene two kinds of relation matching rate of novel score rouge l model cnn dailymail bottomup corrected by fc unilm corrected by fc fasum corrected by fc xsum bottomup corrected by fc corrected by fc unilm corrected by fc fasum corrected by fc table factual consistency score and rouge scores on cnn dailymail and xsum test set p value model unilm fc correction fasum fc correction nli table average relation matching rate rmr eq and nli contradictory ratio between article and mary in cnn dailymail test set the arrow indicates whether larger or smaller value means better result rmr to measure the ratio of correct hits c c w c c w m note that this metric is different from the ratio of overlapping tuples proposed in goodrich et al where the ratio is computed between the ground truth and the candidate summary since even the ground truth summary may not cover all the salient information in the article we choose to compare the knowledge tuples in the candidate summary directly against those in the article an additional advantage of our metric is that it does not require ground truth summaries to be available table displays the result of this metric in cnn dailymail s testset as shown fasum achieves the highest precision of correct hits under both measures and there is a considerable boost from the knowledge graph fasum vs in and in and the rection from the fc model can further improve the metric for both fasum and unilm we also compute factual consistency via natural language inference models following maynez et al we use the bert large model netuned on mnli dataset williams et al provided by fairseq ott et al the model predicts the relationship between the article and summary to be one of the following entailment neutral and tradiction we report the ratio of contradiction as predicted by the model in table as shown sum achieves the lowest ratio and fc helps further reducing conicting facts in generated summaries human evaluation we conduct human evaluation on the factual sistency and informativeness of summaries we randomly sample articles from the test set of cnn dailymail then each article and summary pair is labelled by people from amazon cal turk amt to evaluate the factual consistency and informativeness each labeller gives a score in each category between and being perfect the kappa ratio between reviewer scores is for model bottomup unilm fasum factual score informativeness table human evaluation results of summaries for randomly sampled articles in cnn dailymail test set p value bottomup is better unilm is better fc is better fc is better same same table human evaluation results for side by side comparison of factual consistency on randomly sampled articles from cnn dailymail test set where fc makes modications factual consistency and for informativeness here factual consistency indicates whether the summary s content is faithful with respect to the article informativeness indicates how well the mary covers the salient information in the article as shown in table our model fasum achieves the highest factual consistency score higher than unilm and considerably ing bottomup we conduct a statistical test and nd that compared with unilm our model s score is statistically signicant with p value smaller than under paired t test in terms of ness our model is comparable with unilm and outperforms bottomup finally without the knowledge graph component the model generates summaries with both less factual tency and informativeness to assess the effectiveness of the correction model fc we conduct a human evaluation of by side summaries in cnn dailymail we domly sample articles where the summaries generated by bottomup are modied by fc labelers are asked whether the original or the rected version is factually more correct we collect all the feedbacks and compute the ratio of ments for each case to reduce bias we randomly shufe the two versions of summaries we conduct similar evaluation on unilm as shown in table the corrected summaries are signicantly more likely to be judged as more factually correct for both baseline models for ample of the judgements think the corrected summaries are factually more correct think the corrected version neither improves nor ens the factual consistency while only think that the corrected version becomes worse than the original bottomup summary therefore fc can help boost the factual consistency of summaries from given systems finally to evaluate the quality of the relation matching rate rmr we compute the correlation coefcient between the factual score given by man labelers and the rmr value the result shows that indicating observable relationship between rmr and human evaluation results conclusion in this paper we extract factual information from the article to be represented by a knowledge graph we then integrate this factual knowledge into the process of producing summaries the resulting model fasum enhances the ability to preserve facts during summarization demonstrated by both automatic and human evaluation we also present a correction model fc to rectify factual errors in candidate summaries furthermore we propose an easy to compute model free metric relation ing rate to measure factual consistency based on the overlapping ratio of relational tuples for future work we plan to integrate knowledge graphs into pre training for more accurate and tually consistent summarization moreover we will combine the internally extracted knowledge graph with an external knowledge graph e ceptnet to enhance the commonsense capability of
