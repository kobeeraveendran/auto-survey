jet algorithms wrapping up the subject tkachov institute for nuclear research of russian academy of sciences moscow russia this postscriptum to the theory of jet definition hep summarizes the points which did not find their way into the main text c e d h e h v i x r a introduction i ve just been told that the subject of jet definition can never be wrapped what the title actually means is that this talk is supposed to close the series in which i was presenting the theory of jet definition as it evolved the format and atmosphere of the qfthep workshops made them an ideal venue for that in particular all my useful interactions with talists occurred or started at qftheps including the contact with physicists from which resulted in the dotting of an i in the observation of the top quark see sec so first of all thanks to the or ganiz er theoretical synthesis of the optimal jet definition i do believe that the subject of jet definition is closed in the sense that every thing relevant and important has found its proper place in the theory of optimal jet definition ojd metaphysics what is measurement mathematical statistics the theory of quasi optimal observables whose relevance extends beyond jets to any parameter estimation problems where theoretical input is represented by a monte carlo event generator high mathematics the surprising relevance of the so called topologies for description of metric detectors and hadronic energy flow quantum field theory the central role of energy lators and their fundamental expression in terms of the energy momentum tensor qcd the issues of ir safety numerical mathematics algorithms for minimum search in k dimensions and software engineering the use of advanced software development tools the person who said that announced after the talk his willingness to eat his words culminating in the design of a fast and robust optimal jet finder the code is available from there is a remarkable synergy between different pieces and none can be omitted without damaging the whole from the above list it should be clear why it took years to solve the problem of jet definition principles of the theory the theory is systematically developed in two long papers it is based on the following metaphysical realizations treated in detail in i an absolute importance of the subject indeed data processing algorithms observables are a meeting point of experimental data and theoretical formulae hadronic jets are a way to observe quarks and gluons jets are everywhere in hep realization of the absolute importance of the subject made me dismiss the that any reasonable piece of fortran code can in principle be accepted as a jet definition the sentiment is only an expression of theoretical frustration at the years failure to find a solid foundation on which to build a systematic theory of jet definition ii the theory of jet definition should be tightly linked to quantum field theory the theory of fundamental interactions of which jets are a visible manifestation in fact my very first impression from the first explanations i received about jet algorithms from at fermilab in was a surprise at how un field theoretical the popular jet algorithms it was obvious to me as the discoverer of the algorithms on which the flourishing industry of nnlo qcd voiced by mangano at there is a paradox here because and weinberg each published a textbook on qft i have an explanation for the paradox but it has nothing to do with the subject of jets calculations is based that the conventional jet definitions do not conform to qft at the basic tical structural level resulting in complications for systematic theoretical analyses iii jet algorithms must be fully understood as an instrument of physical measurement an implication is that the analysis of measurement errors including fluctuations due to the statistical nature of quantum theory predictions most notably how such errors survive the jet algorithms based data processing must be a central issue to be addressed by the theory this line of thought led me to investigate the following fundamental analogy length energy flow calorimetric detector ruler real number filling the empty slot was the key issue i was preoccupied with in in the practical aspect ref introduced i a large new class of generalized shape observables the so called c algebra some interpreted as integer jet numbers others so called spectral discriminators sensitive to the structure of multi jet substates the motivation was to illustrate that jet algorithms are in principle not needed to extract the physical information usually obtained by their mediacy such information is best extracted using generalized shape observables this became a theorem in my second paper and finally that jet algorithms are from this viewpoint only a means for approximate construction of such observables the notion of regularization of event cuts as an fective means to suppress statistical fluctuations induced in answers and thus enhance the signal background offered a more systematic treatment and provided new examples and prescriptions for regularizations a binary recombination algorithm with an optimal recombination criterion which was derived uniquely from first principles within the assumption of the binary recombination scheme and which turned out to be a geometric mean of the jade and geneva criteria the optimal criterion was generalized in into a global recombination scheme to become the optimal jet definition in effect the paper introduced a novel systematic point of view on jet algorithms as a means of tion of observables for precision measurements it is in a sense purely kinematical in that it starts from the analysis of measurement errors and their evolution in data processing algorithms so that on the surface dynamical issues play a subordinate role see however the discussion in sec after the paper was finished a well meaning theorist advised me that i should now do some data processing the advice was ignored the complexity of the problem called for some division of labor i just did what i could in my situation and went to great sparing no to make my findings read by theorists and experimentalists alike as a reward for all the agony not counting the damage my other projects suffered due to a few years neglect the paper earned me exactly three external citations to the experimental one i ll turn in of the other two one was an incorrect attempt to literally implement an ancillary interpretation quoted in a footnote of see for details the other was a prominent but non specific citation in a review talk behind the scenes there was among other things an earlier negative report on which expressed a conviction that kinematics is not what the theory of jet algorithms is about and that the qcd dynamics was the real issue my reply systematically presented in was that it may not be healthy to proceed to the dessert of dynamics without first doing away with the soup of setting up the kinematics correctly in fact there are two potentially conflicting issues which jet definition is best for theoretical calculations which jet algorithm is best for extracting maximum information from experimental data the theory of the popular kt algorithm simply misses b and settling on an ad algorithmic scheme successive binary recombinations focuses on on top of that convenience of theoretical calculations is judged from the standpoint of the sudakov lipatov method of leading logarithmic approximation no expert in diagrammatics can fail to appreciate the beauty of sudakov s paper or to be frustrated at least at first by lipatov s calculational tornado yet to me the lla techniques is rather an antiquated piece there are much more powerful ways to handle diagrams in short the argumentation behind the kt algorithm left me unimpressed like spending a hours long birthday passing customs waiting for a delayed plane and flying non stop across the whole of europe the atlantic and a good part of usa all this heroism in order to drop the preprint right where the action was the outrageously un academic but extremely effective graphic on the first page was employed only after testing its effect on a few unwary colleagues but what about for convenience of discussion i divide the algorithms in the language of theory dynamics is nothing more than qualitative properties of qcd matrix elements the most basic such property is the collinear singularities with the probability density behaving as q q d where q is the collinear angle of the emitted parton the leading power behavior is exactly what mines the specific form of the usual conditions of ir safety as explicitly formulated in so making one s observables ir safe already includes the most important dynamical information into the picture this is the case with ojd both the recombination version of and the global n part n jets variant of if the collinear singularities were more severe then restrictions would have to be imposed not only q on the values of observables but also on their first derivatives and the entire theory together with the resulting ojd would have changed accordingly compared with the leading power behavior mic corrections resummed or not play a dinate role this is particularly clear in the context of the theory which offers a constructive model for the notion of physical information of the event so as no surprise comes the evidence see that the behavior of various flavors of kt algorithm would differ from the binary version of ojd within the tainties of the kt type algorithms moreover contains an argument which strates that ojd is optimal not only in the kinematical sense but which was not a priori expected also in a properly formulated dynamical sense this shows that the ir safety reflecting the singular structure is all that really must be taken into account in the definition of jets anything on top of that is best treated as something only theorists should worry about in their calculations this conclusion is corroborated by the findings of to which i now turn comparison of different binary recombination algorithms another theoretical paper which came to my attention recombination scheme after the completion of is the comparison of various versions of the iterative formed by acknowledged experts in such matters the comparison contains a number of results which are visible confirmations of some a priori claims made in and for many such explicit calculations may be more convincing than the logical a question by catani at a difficulty with synthetic solutions is that they often involve logical patterns which abstract experiences from other problem domains considered in into two groups the good rithms variations of the venerable and the kt and the bad algorithms jade and geneva it was of course superfluous to include into parison the optimal criterion of because its behavior can be easily deduced from the results for the two bad algorithms the latter fact being not mentioned in here are some comments the optimal geneva and jade criteria have tively the following forms e a e a e e a b e b e e a e e e a b b q cos ab q cos q cos ab ab y cut y cut y cut the optimal criterion happens to be a geometric mean of the other two it is perfectly clear that its behavior should also be a median one now the several graphs presented in figs show that the behavior of jade is always the worst geneva behaves erratically and the good algorithms populate the band between jade and geneva the band turns out to be pretty wide proving that the effect of what one expects to be insignificant algorithmic variations such as changes in the order of tions is large and not incomparable with the difference between the good and bad algorithms it is also perfectly obvious that the optimal criterion is bound to be among the good algorithms an tion is that its global analog the ojd must behave similarly to the good algorithms now on to the experimental citation of where such experiences may be common knowledge rather then the specific one being dealt with where such principles can be a novelty and as such are greeted with suspicion note that the definition of luclus changed compared with the original the luclus is equivalent to the optimal criterion with the angular factor square rooted the top signal in the all jets channel at recall that the two collaborations which reported the discovery of the top at fnal in cdf and were in very different positions cdf had the svx tagging hardware which proved to be a powerful means for selecting the events with top in particular at the time of the top discovery in could not see the top signal in the all jets channel so there was a strong competitive pressure on to seek alternative methods the preprint release of could not be more timely i d like to emphasize that the initial contact with physicists occurred at another peculiar circumstance is that both physicists klatchko and who are to be credited for bringing the new theory to the attention of the all jets team had to leave physics at picked up a copy of my talk and brought it to fermilab the copy was inherited by although about to leave physics too he made the effort of finding me at fermilab where i was able to visit thanks to a soros grant and the hospitality of fnal theorists showed me around the detector and brought me into contact with other members of the all jets group and and we had a nice long discussion about regularization of cuts and spectral discriminators sotnikova a member of both and the qfthep team ensured that the draft of was well advertised and plentifully available at the next time i heard about the all jets group was at from who mentioned some striking results but could not provide any details i tried to get into contact with but failed i heard nothing from them since then and switched to asymptotic expansions of feynman diagrams the subject neglected since in favor of jets until i ran across ref while at cern in march their page contains the following passage which i can not resist quoting additional cuts are applied to remove events with noise from the main ring after these cuts about events remain at this stage the signal to background ratio is about requiring an slt tag increases the signal background by about an order of magnitude leaving events to make further progress performs a multivariate analysis using thirteen variables described briefly in table the principal ones are h h t t h t e t e t the average jet count an jets the aplanarity a the centrality c h t jets e jet m and the transverse momentum of the muon tp a particularly powerful and unusual variable is the average jet count defined by n a jets gev gev e n e de t t t gev gev e de t t is the number of jets with transverse energy greater than te this variable inspired by the work where of is interesting in that it assigns a nonintegral number of jets to the event n e t these thirteen variables are combined using feed forward neural networks the final result of the procedure is observation of the excess of events containing top over background in the total cross section at the level of to appreciate the work behind the observable note that it has no direct analog in i can think of the following way to arrive at it in the so called spectral discriminators were introduced which for narrow jets allowed representations s d s d w s s j j where summation runs over all of the event and s j is a variable like invariant mass or transverse energy of the this kind of observables are not usually considered and must have simply ignored what i wrote about how such observables can be defined bypassing jets and focused on the simplest case distribution of event s jets along the axis et and tried to see how the resulting patterns for background events and n e t top events differ they might have replaced d with the equivalent integral quantities similarly to how this is done in the probability theory to avoid directly dealing with singular probability densities and then used event generators to study the corresponding patterns for background events and events with top to arrive at their observable see sec at this point i can not help reminiscing how a nent qcd expert told me he d found hensible apparently because there were in it no leading logarithms no parton distributions in short none of what qcd theorists swear by another expert advised me that the things i discussed were not what experimentalists really needed also shortly after the release of an american theorist ventured to run tests of spectral discriminators despite obtaining tures which fully agreed with the qualitative expectations of strangely made an exactly opposite conclusion my guess is he simply coded the formulae of as is without trying to understand their meaning and naively expected to see exactly the bumps i draw there instead he saw a shoulder and a steeply rising background to the left of it the presence of the shoulder was a clear cation that the signal was there and one only had to study its evolution and to figure out a simple way to extract the numerical information a wavelet filter would do nicely but apparently there are easier ways for a theorist equipped with a computer and a mc generator to produce a publication than deep tation with novel ways to process data for fairness sake the dominant software engineering platform in hep fortran c does not encourage such experimentation power of regularizations an important trick in the construction of good observables is regularization this is a concept widely used in applied mathematics see for references in and i only gave simple examples to illustrate potential benefits of regularizations which by the way come in many flavors although with the same underlying principles the above observable offers a great real world discovery class example of how useful a regularization can be n c indeed suppose one has noticed that top events tend to produce more energetic jets then one would consider the event has n jets with the observable gies above c with some c an integer valued vable is discontinuous and its discontinuities are on general grounds sources of non optimality loss of physical information due to unnecessary enhancement of statistical fluctuations in the transition from raw data to the values of the observable see such non lities are eliminated by introducing a continuous zation in the form of a smearing over the cut c general principles do not fix details like the weight used for the smearing at this point some experimentation is needed finding an optimal shape of regularization ever is a much more specific task than the original one note that the smearing as a way to regulate a hard cut was not explicitly mentioned in although smearings were mentioned in other contexts a conclusion from the experience is as follows learn to use regularizations optimal jet definition the final form the second part of the theory improved upon the first in almost every point i now had a proof that observables which yield the theoretically best precision for a particular parameter are always the generalized shape observables jets based observables can only yield approximations to such optimal observables as a result the entire theory of jet algorithms now reduces to studying ways of construction of such approximations it is this embedding of the problem of jet definition into a broader context which provides an unambiguous criterion for deciding which algorithm is best the best jet algorithm is that which allows one to construct the best observable for measurements of a given parameter the best observable is that which yields the best precision for the parameter second i now derived the most general n part n jets recombination criterion for finding jets the criterion required minimization of a multi axes generalization of the well known thrust an e mail from about a forthcoming session of the jet definition working group at fnal in march stimulated exploration of algorithmic implementations of ojd resulting in an efficient code third there were systematically motivated ways to treat the problem of non uniqueness of jet configurations via association of multiple appropriately weighted jet configurations with the same event for details the reader is referred to quasi optimal observables pondering the observable one is faced with a natural question is there a way to obtain such particularly powerful observables in this and similar problems with less guesswork than had been involved in the finding of the answer is yes and the ponding prescriptions are called the theory of optimal observables in view of its general importance it was posted separately rephrased in the jargon of parameter estimation of mathematical statistics the theory is simple and closely related to the rao cramer inequality see or quasi optimal observables are a means to approach the quality of the maximal likelihood method in tions where its application is problematic such as encountered in hep infinite dimensionality of the lying event space and a probability density in the form of event generator rather than an explicit formula although maximal likelihood is widely used see the method of quasi optimal observables is simpler more flexible and offers new options both for design of general purpose software tools and for data processing in specific applications for instance instead of the observable i would simply mc generate a quasi optimal observable in the jet dimensional space of the variables te using a rectangular grid the formal parameter to be estimated would be the coupling to produce top antitop pairs if constructed with enough care such an observable might well obviate the need for neural networks this would certainly be the case for a quasi optimal observable constructed for the variables including the six te plus all the variables from table which can not be expressed in terms of these jet it would be interesting to develop universal adaptive software to automatically generate quasi optimal vables given a sample of events and a number of more or less variables it looks like this could be done without recurring to fancy techniques such as neural networks a practical conclusion is this learn to construct quasi optimal observables unless i missed something in the top mass has not yet been measured in the all jets channel at this could be an excellent starting point the global n part n jets recombination algorithm the derivation description and discussion can be found in a convenient brief summary of the tion is given in suffice it to say the following ojd prescribes to determine the jet configuration via minimization of shape observables which generalize the venerable thrust to n axes ojd is similar to a cone in that there is a parameter r which limits the cone radius and the resulting cones are less irregular than with binary recombinations being a global version of the binary recombination algorithm of its behavior and properties stability can only be better than for the binary recombination version which as we saw in should be on a par with other good jet the speed of jet search is expected to be o n o n part compared with the n behavior part jets of binary recombination schemes including k t this property alone might make ojd the jet algorithm of choice for future colliders such as lhc where plicities are much higher ojd is intrinsically connected with the theory of i incorrectly stated in a talk that ojd is equivalent to a cone algorithm for events with well defined jets however the cone radius in ojd depends on the distribution of energy around the jet axis so that the techniques of energy corrections developed for fixed cone algorithms would have to be modified this has been confirmed in a number of un premeditated tests run on realistic mc event samples by pablo achard in at least one graph i saw with my own eyes ojd resolved partons significantly better with an efficiency close to than kt in the entire interval of rapidities where both algorithms yielded meaningful results quasi optimal observables as a result ojd unlike binary recombination algorithms whether optimal or kt offers natural regularizations to solve such problems as the potential non uniqueness of jet configurations which reflects the fact that different parton configurations may generate the same hadronic final state on the difficulty of computer implementation from i learned that generalizations of thrust were proposed for jet definition in the early s the exact form of ojd in particular the treatment of soft energy via an additive term could of course not have been guessed a priori on the other hand ref concluded that jet search based on optimization of like shape observables was computationally prohibitive to this i note the following the code and data structures of the ojd tation described in take under k of ram for events and the algorithm finds jets for such an event in a fraction of a second on a modest such an algorithm could be implemented even on a pc with k of ram what was lacking was not hardware or even software the old fortran iv not to say turbo pascal would have been sufficient but expertise in numerical matics and software engineering as well as tion determination could have only come from tion of the theoretical depths behind ojd the software engineering aspect is discussed in the notes collected in here i would only like to point out that the cement of fortran in favor of rather than strictly type safe languages such as any version of see in the physicists software engineering is a disaster of historic proportions and a good part of the explanation of inability of theorists to accomplish plete loop calculations for it is also absolutely irrational in view of the existence of simple and powerful alternative in the form of the family of languages representing the brilliant tradition of design of and his school starting from the old pascal see for more on this the harnessing of the digital revolution being a major infrastructure problem in physics as elsewhere a petent and responsible policy of steering the hep munity towards the use of safe programming languages and redirecting human energy released thereby into more productive activities than debugging codes would have a major positive impact on physics for the events tested by pablo achard the ojd tation of was somewhat slower but not significantly than note that ref focused on feasibility studies and did not attempt to implement all possible algorithmic optimizations conclusions appendix the benefits of ojd compared with kt all the qcd argumentation behind kt boils down in the end to the proposition that with it better theoretical calculations are possible however experimental data are more valuable than theoretical numbers preserving information from data is more important than making it easier for theorists to do their calculations ojd is optimal precisely because it preserves the experimental information in the best manner possible as regards calculations nothing compares with shape observables such as thrust in regard of calculability lla or nlla and amenability to theoretical analyses power corrections and ojd is based on such observables furthermore there are better ways to do complex calculations than the archaic lipatov sudakov techniques namely the systematic machinery of asymptotic operation whose euclidean version remember is behind most of the well known nnlo calculations in qcd further the binary recombination scheme per is flawed cf the large variations between different variants of good recombination criteria the kt algorithm behaves quadratically in the number of particles and ojd may run faster for lhc cities ojd offers new options for a systematic construction of better observables options not available within any conventional jet definition schemes to the best of my understanding the subject of jet definition as a theoretical problem is closed the most important next task in regard of jet related data processing appears to be for physicists to learn to use ojd for construction of quasi optimal observables for specific applications psychologically the main difficulty may be to stop wasting human effort and other valuable resources on the obsolete jet definitions acknowledgments this work was supported in part by the russian dation for basic research quantum field theory under grant i am grateful to von schlippe for a comment and to for suggesting a term finally it is my greatest pleasure to thank the zers of the qfthep workshops boos tchenko savrin and sveshnikov for their invariable support over all these years there is far too much to my taste of this sort of things that goes unrecorded so here is my contribution in when the above fnal report was released the hep section of the russian foundation for basic research denied me support for my projects if the support were not resumed by the quantum field theory section and no jets were not even mentioned in my grant application you would most certainly not learn about ojd this must have something to do as i realize post factum with the old story of landau bogolyubov reflected within the russian theoretical physics in the form of a certain gruppovschina with the two sections of rfbr influenced by the respective theoretical schools i do not see what i personally have to do with that old story except a sufficient mathematical background to have drifted in my years of innocence to bogolyubov s cathedra i do own a complete set of the landau and lifshits textbooks too for fairness sake the fundamental reason for that bitter controversy lied not so much in particular personalities the mistake usually made but in the overcentralization of everything in russia so that the entire hierarchy is affected by idiosyncrasies of the individuals at the top multiplied by the centuries old tradition of servility of subordinates there is an objective tendency for similar effects to occur wherever individuals are endowed with considerable administrative powers germany comes to mind with perhaps servility replaced by discipline and wherever resource allocation politics finds fertile soil in complex hierarchies within which there often are no efficient checks to deter individuals from irresponsibility in spreading their necessarily somewhat subjective opinions i wish i could benefit from even a tiny fraction of the funds used up by the two jet definition working groups fnal and des houches which operated during while the work on the final version of and on the software implementation of ojd was in progress a mere would have been enough for a mighty upgrade of my computers it is rather a paradox given the state of physics in russia that up to this point the work on the theory of jets and ojd was performed as a kind of charity for the international hep community references
