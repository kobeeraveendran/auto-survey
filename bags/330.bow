jsss free japanese speech corpus for summarization and simplication shinnosuke mamoru naoko and hiroshi school of information science and technology the university of tokyo tokyo japan school of systems design tokyo metropolitan university tokyo japan shinnosuke i tokyo ac jp t c o s a s s e e v v i x r a abstract in this paper we construct a new japanese speech corpus for speech based summarization and simplication jsss nounced triple s given the success of reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences we aim to design more difcult tasks for delivering information to humans our corpus contains voices recorded for two tasks that have a role in ing information under constraints duration constrained to speech summarization and speaking style simplication it also contains utterances of long form sentences as an optional task this paper describes how we designed the corpus which is available on our project page index terms speech corpus japanese speech summarization speaking style simplication text to speech introduction text to speech tts synthesis achieved to synthesize human quality speech in very limited tasks e reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences of some rich resourced languages both open source code and open speech corpora help open innovation of speech based technologies since we have released high quality and large scale japanese speech corpora the jsut and jsut song corpora are for voice synthesis and the jvs and jvs music corpora are for multi speaker singer modeling open projects developed by third ties provide synthesis engines and machine learning recipes ing our corpora with the success of reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences we aim to design two challenging tasks for delivering information to humans duration constrained text to speech summarization and speaking style tion the former summarizes text by a spoken language at a sired duration and the latter synthesizes speech intelligible for non native speakers these tasks help provide information der the constraints of time limitations or language prociency they are challenging because their speech characteristics are far from those of basic reading style speech for these tasks we developed a new japanese speech corpus jsss pronounced triple s our corpus poses speech data and its transcription we recorded speech with high quality settings studio recording uncompressed dio format and a well experienced native speaker we also recorded speech of and long form sentences as an tional task our corpus has eight hours of high quality speech data and is available at our project page from the next section we describe how we designed the corpus corpus design our corpus consists of the following four sub corpora summarization utterances for duration constrained to speech summarization simplication short utterances spoken in slow ble style short form short utterances spoken with read style long form long utterances spoken with read style the directory structures of the corpus are listed below sub dir name indicates the sub directory described in the following sections summarization original transcript simplification transcript txt hiragana txt short form sub dir name transcript txt long form sub dir name original transcript summarization automatic text summarization generates a short coherent summary of given text shortening it while retaining its important content text length constrained text tion is text summarization technology that has practical plication it abstractively summarizes text to t a device that plays a summary against such textual length constraints this sub section addresses speech length constraint namely we propose a new task named speech length constrained or duration constrained text to speech summarization it tively summarizes text with a spoken language to a desired speech duration we recorded speech for this task the text to be rized was web news which we saved in original txt our speaker summarized the texts and uttered them to t duration that the speaker chose in advance the durations chosen for each text were around and sec we did not set time limits for recording and the speaker could re record as many times as needed after the recording rst we manually transcribed the speech then we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks and added sentence level time alignment as shown low we saved the transcription in transcript txt long form start time finish time transcription cf benesse corporation conducted a survey of ried women between the ages of and to nd out what the chinese characters for this year would be and the number one choice was which means funny or change furthermore positive characters are listed in the chinese characters for next year first place is bright second place is fun and third place is happy i feel hopeful that next year will be bright fun and happy simplication given the effect the global pandemic has had on japan in there is a question of how we can convey emergency and lifeline information to the approximately three million eign residents living in japan the immigration vices agency of japan and the agency for cultural affairs ported that many foreign residents prefer simple japanese rather than english for information services simple japanese speech is much different from standard reading style speech simple japanese sentences use daily use phrases with a ited vocabulary and are uttered in a slow intelligible style text simplication with lexical constraint can potentially articially simplify vocabulary in text on the other hand here we deal with speaking style simplication which aims to cially synthesize speech in a slow intelligible style fore we instructed a speaker on the speaking style and recorded speech of simple pre designed sentences an example is below cf there was a big earthquake when uttering a long form sentence that consists of tiple sentences human speakers usually insert phrase breaks between word transitions without punctuation this plays an important role in listenable and expressive speech thesizing such speech is more challenging than ing basic short utterances to construct a corpus for it we recorded speech uttering wikipedia articles corresponding to sub dir name our speaker uttered articles paragraph by paragraph excluding tables gures and their captions ter the recording we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks and sentence level time alignment as shown below start time finish time transcription cf in kagawa prefecture udon is a particularly popular local dish and the amount consumed per person is also the highest in japan in terms of prefectural statistics this is one of the most successful ples of a regional brand using the name of a region as a brand for food and other items resulting in an increase in the number of tourists an increase in the amount of udon produced and an increase in name recognition in this sub corpus we saved the original text in nal txt and transcription in transcript txt note that punctuation in the transcribed text was inserted at the phrase breaks so the positions differ from that of the original text results of data collection in this sub corpus we saved the text in transcript txt and manually converted it into in hiragana txt settings short form synthesizing an isolated short utterance is a basic tts task to build a basic tts system we recorded speech data of form sentence utterances we prepared three subsets sponding to sub dir name from the jsut corpus as follows phoneme balanced minimal set mid sized set that includes japanese matopoeias large sized set after the recording we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks note that the positions are different from the original data stored in the jsut corpus syllabary that shows pronunciation we hired a female native japanese speaker who is not a professional speaker but has voice training we recorded her voice in an anechoic room at the university of tokyo using an ipad mini with a mounted shure a microphone the rst author directed the recording her voice was nally sampled at khz and downsampled to khz by sptk we recorded in bit sample riff wav format and coded in bit sample format sentences transcriptions were encoded in for duration constrained text to speech summarization we used the livedoor new corpus as the original text to be summarized for speaking style tion we followed text and speaking style instructiond provided by hirosaki for long form utterances we used three featured japanese articles from wikipedia sanuki udon downloaded cc hirosaki u ac jp kokugo html but currently they are not available because the laboratory was closed in them from table statistics of sub corpora sub corpus summarization simplication short form long form total style news reading slow speaking reading reading utterances duration hour duration utt sec noodles of japanese cuisine masakazu katsura japanese manga artist and washington d c capital of the united states statistics table lists the number of utterances and durations for each sub corpus simplication and short form consist of short utterances approximately seconds per utterance rization and long form consist of utterances approximately seconds per utterance approximately times longer than short utterances the total duration is approximately hours which is slightly shorter than our previous corpus designed for the end to end tts
