summarization large bodies text involves lot human effort time especially legal domain lawyers spend lot time preparing legal briefs clients case files automatic text summarization constantly evolving field natural language subdiscipline artificial intelligence field paper hybrid method automatic text summarization legal cases means clustering technique frequency inverse document frequency word vectorizer proposed summary generated proposed method compared rogue evaluation parameters case summary prepared lawyer appeal court suggestions improving proposed method presented automatic text summarization legal domain means clustering idf word vectors keywords introduction information data increased tremendously field years limited human capacity consuming information paramount extract useful information vast unstructured data available text summarization plays important role extracting useful pieces information possibly large bodies text automatic text summarization process producing textual summaries output given certain textual document input computational power machine involves reducing text document short set words paragraph conveys main meaning need automatic text summarization field legal cases continuously increasing number cases piling courtroom currently lot effort goes manual drafting case headnotes synopses legal systems world generate massive amounts unstructured text day judges lawyers case workers process review millions cases year united states preparing legal case summary difficult task summary contain relevant facts precedents necessary persuade court favour plaintiff lawyers spend hours preparing legal briefs computer minutes automatic text summarization necessity overcome challenges paper novel hybrid approach automatic text summarization legal domain clustering technique proposed paper organised follows section contains overview description terms associated text summarization section contains overview existing approaches currently text summarization section contains description proposed method section consists information data implementation section approach compared existing tech bachelor student techniques text summarization insight performance proposed method section contains proposal future work section consists conclusion background summarization challenging sub task broader text text generation field natural language processing automatic text summarization broadly types extractive summarization method involves selecting useful relevant sentences document provide summary sentences originally present document form summary new sentences formed extractive summaries produce set significant sentences document exactly abstractive summarization type summarization new sentences formed relevant document gist document represented computer generated sentences having close resemblance summary produced humans abstractive text summarization captures salient features text summary generated words sentence input text lot research ongoing domain depending number documents given input broadly types single document summarization single document given input text summarization model summary document produced output useful relevant sentences entire document extracted form summary multi document summarization multi document text summarization defined process extracting relevant data creating short version multiple source document given input sentences best representing documents unit given output hybrid method proposed paper based extractive summarization single document legal case given input legal brief best representing useful relevant facts produced output legal brief produced serves important tool lawyers present case courtroom contain important information relevant case including facts events necessary win case important economical time spent actual reading case economical writing brief existing approaches different kinds methods proposed text summarization legal domain earliest works area include fast legal expert consultant flexicon system developed gelbart smith gelbartand smith flexicon keyword based referencing large database terms find important regions text gelbart smith served starting point text summarization approaches legal domain salomon based cosine similarity proposed served alternative flexicon later sum thematic structure projects served improvement previously proposed systems provide structured representation legal briefs later novel approach lexa proposed based citation analysis lexa includes interface continued system learning

algorithms summarizing legal cases remains challenging daunting task complexity cases sheer size legal cases text summarization tools fail produce summaries large documents complexity algorithm summarizing document important devise method gives optimal results gives certain time limit important specifically develop methods text summarization legal cases size legal cases having pages result system failure indefinite waiting period complete execution system proposed paper perfect legal cases performs optimally gives summary required length case file hundreds pages proposed system implementation carried different steps pre processing clustering similar sentences extracting ranked sentences cluster pre processing pre processing document vital text summarization approach foremost step proposed approach includes removing unnecessary punctuations merging acronyms given removing extra periods present case files rich nltk library python remove stop words tokenize sentences words lemmatize pre processing clean document ready clustering produced clustering pre processing case file clustering similar sentences carried clustering algorithm approach means clustering algorithm iterative algorithm executes times different centroids converges given number clusters set dimensional objects clustered clustering process grouping set dimensional dimensional dimensional objects clusters similar objects objects like cluster dissimilar clusters proposed method rich sklearn library python vectorize sentences idf vectorizer sklearn library convert words vector representations frequency inverse document frequency value word given clustering sentences performed document level meaning similar sentences document form clusters intra cluster distances minimum cluster distances maximum number optimum clusters required efficiency calculated algorithms like elbow method information criterion approach silhouette width clusters represent similar types sentences certain number sentences extracted cluster depending rank summary contains sentences obtained different clusters ensuring summary formed redundancy contains sentences provide overview entire legal case file formation clusters step extract ranked sentences cluster extraction sentences cluster sentence cluster rank associated based features idf score sentence sum idf value words sentence divided sum idf value words present document idf words sentence idf words document sentence similarity title sentences similar title case generally present important facts related case aiding generating useful relevant summary similarity score title calculated length similar words length words title noun form words nns nnp nnps penn tree bank sentences title compared sentences belonging cluster ranked based sum scores idf similarity sentence title sentences having higher score ranked higher ones lower score equal number ranked sentences selected cluster easier calculations optimal summary required number sentences legal case document case summary extracting ranking sentences cluster calculating idf title similarity score sentence extraction sentences tokenizing sentences lematizing words removing
