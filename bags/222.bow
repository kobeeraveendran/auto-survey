automatic text summarization of legal cases a hybrid approach varun pandya department of computer science and engineering school of technology pandit deendayal petroleum university india com abstract manual summarization of large bodies of text involves a lot of human effort and time especially in the legal domain lawyers spend a lot of time preparing legal briefs of their clients case files automatic text summarization is a constantly evolving field of natural language which is a subdiscipline of the artificial intelligence field in this paper a hybrid method for automatic text summarization of legal cases using k means clustering technique and tf frequency inverse document frequency word vectorizer is proposed the summary generated by the proposed method is compared using rogue evaluation parameters with the case summary as prepared by the lawyer for appeal in court further suggestions for improving the proposed method are also presented automatic text summarization legal domain k means clustering tf idf word vectors keywords introduction the amount of information and data has increased tremendously in every field over the years with the limited human capacity of consuming information it becomes paramount to extract only useful information out of the vast amount of unstructured data available thus text summarization plays an important role in extracting useful pieces of information from possibly large bodies of text automatic text summarization is the process of producing textual summaries as output given a certain textual document as an input using the computational power of machine it involves reducing a text document into a short set of words or paragraph that conveys the main meaning of the the need for automatic text summarization in the field of legal cases is continuously increasing with the number of cases piling up in the courtroom currently a lot of effort goes into the manual drafting of case headnotes synopses and legal systems across the world generate massive amounts of unstructured text every day judges lawyers and case workers process and review millions of cases each year in the united states preparing a legal case summary is a difficult task since the summary must contain relevant facts and precedents necessary to persuade the court in the favour of the plaintiff lawyers often spend many hours preparing legal briefs which can be done by a computer in a few minutes thus automatic text summarization is a necessity to overcome these challenges in this paper a novel hybrid approach of automatic text summarization in legal domain using clustering technique is proposed the paper is organised as follows section contains the overview and description of the terms associated with text summarization section contains the overview of the existing approaches which are currently being used for text summarization section contains the description of the proposed method section consists of the information of data used for implementation and in section the approach is compared with the existing tech bachelor student techniques of text summarization to get an insight in the performance of the proposed method section contains the proposal for future work and section consists of the conclusion background summarization is a challenging sub task of the broader text to text generation field of natural language processing automatic text summarization is broadly of two types extractive summarization this method involves selecting the most useful and relevant sentences from the document to provide a summary here the sentences originally present in the document are used to form the summary with no new sentences being formed extractive summaries produce a set of the most significant sentences from a document exactly as they abstractive summarization in this type of summarization new sentences are formed which are relevant to the document here the gist of the document is represented using computer generated sentences having close resemblance to the summary as produced by humans abstractive text summarization captures the salient features of the text and summary is generated by words sentence that may may not be in the input text a lot of research is ongoing in this domain depending upon the number of documents given as input there are broadly two types single document summarization here a single document is given as an input to the text summarization model and a summary of the document is produced as an output the most useful and relevant sentences from the entire document are extracted and used to form a summary multi document summarization multi document text summarization can be defined as a process of extracting relevant data and creating a short version of multiple source here more than one document is given as input and the sentences best representing the documents as a unit are given as output the hybrid method proposed in this paper is based on extractive summarization of single document a legal case is given as an input and a legal brief best representing the useful and relevant facts is produced as an output the legal brief produced serves as an important tool for lawyers to present their case in the courtroom they contain important information relevant to the case including all the facts and events which are necessary to win the case it is as important to be economical to the time spent on the actual reading of the case as it is to be economical in the writing of the brief existing approaches different kinds of methods have been proposed for text summarization in the legal domain the earliest of works in this area include the fast legal expert consultant flexicon system developed by gelbart and smith gelbartand smith flexicon is keyword based referencing against a large database of terms to find important regions of text gelbart and smith it served as a starting point for the text summarization approaches in legal domain salomon based on cosine similarity proposed by el al served as an alternative to flexicon later the sum and the on the thematic structure projects served as an improvement on the previously proposed systems to provide a structured representation of the legal briefs later a novel approach lexa was proposed based on citation analysis lexa includes an interface for continued system learning using down rules rdr which allows domain experts to evaluate sentence selections live and agree or disagree with the a lot of systems for automatic text summarization have been proposed till date these include casesummarizer summarist smmry and a lot of other proposed methods and algorithms however summarizing legal cases remains a challenging and daunting task because of the complexity of cases as well as the sheer size of legal cases many text summarization tools fail to produce summaries of large documents because of the complexity of algorithm used for summarizing the document thus it is important to devise a method which not only gives optimal results but also gives them within a certain time limit also it is important to specifically develop methods for text summarization of legal cases because of the size of legal cases sometimes having more than pages which might result in system failure or an indefinite waiting period for complete execution the system proposed in this paper is perfect for legal cases since it performs optimally and gives summary of required length even when the case file has hundreds of pages the proposed system the implementation is carried out in three different steps pre processing clustering of similar sentences extracting top ranked sentences from each cluster pre processing pre processing of the document is a vital part of any text summarization approach it is the foremost step of the proposed approach which includes removing of the unnecessary punctuations merging the acronyms of a given f c removing extra periods which are often present in case files along with this the rich nltk library of python has been used to remove stop words tokenize the sentences and words and lemmatize them after pre processing a clean document ready for clustering is produced clustering after pre processing the case file clustering of similar sentences is carried out the clustering algorithm used in this approach is the k means clustering algorithm it is an iterative algorithm that executes many times with different centroids until it converges given k where k is the number of clusters and a set of n dimensional objects to be clustered clustering is the process of grouping a set of n dimensional dimensional dimensional objects into k clusters of similar objects o objects should be like one another within the same cluster and dissimilar to those in other clusters in the proposed method the rich sklearn library of python is used to vectorize the sentences the tf idf vectorizer of sklearn library is used to convert words to their vector representations the tf frequency inverse document frequency value of a word is given by here clustering of sentences is performed at the document level meaning that similar sentences within the document will form clusters such that intra cluster distances are minimum and cluster distances are maximum the number of optimum clusters required for efficiency can be calculated using various algorithms like elbow method information criterion approach silhouette width these clusters represent the similar types of sentences and hence certain number of sentences can be extracted from each cluster depending upon their rank such that the summary contains sentences obtained from different clusters thus ensuring that the summary formed has less redundancy and contains sentences which can provide an overview of the entire legal case file after the formation of clusters the next step is to extract the top ranked sentences from each cluster extraction of sentences from each cluster for every sentence in each cluster a rank is associated based on two features tf idf score of each sentence the sum of tf idf value of all words of the sentence is divided by the sum of tf idf value for all the words present in the document idf of all words of sentence idf of all words of document sentence similarity to title the sentences similar to the title of the case generally present the important facts related to the case thus aiding in generating a useful and relevant summary the similarity score to the title is calculated as length of similar words length of words in title here only the noun form words nn nns nnp nnps penn tree bank of the sentences and title are compared the sentences belonging to a cluster are ranked based on the sum of these two scores tf idf and similarity of sentence to the title the sentences having a higher score are ranked higher than the ones with lower score equal number of top ranked sentences are selected from each cluster for easier calculations thus we get the optimal summary with the required number of sentences legal case document case summary extracting top ranking sentences from each cluster calculating tf idf and title similarity score for each sentence extraction of sentences tokenizing sentences lematizing words removing unnecessary stop words and punctuations pre processing forming tf idf value vectors for words clustering sentences using k means algorithm clustering figure framework of the proposed system implementation for implementation auslii edu au was used which consists of a database of australian legal cases the legal cases consist of the headnotes and summary within the case file the legal cases downloaded in pdf format are given as input and the legal summary is produced as output by the system the system was tested with a randomly selected legal v nationwide news pty ltd no fca april from the database the case file consists of more than pages containing the facts and sequence of events required for convincing the jury the summary provided with the case file consisted of pages approximately sentences this legal case was given as an input to the system and approximately sentence summary was generated in under minutes to match its length with the provided summary for better comparison evaluation summaries are difficult to evaluate because of their subjective nature the relevance and usefulness of each sentence in the summary changes with the person evaluating them hence lin et al introduced a set of metrics called the rouge package in lin that provide a pairwise comparison method for evaluating candidate summaries against human provided rouge stands for recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation and it counts the number of overlapping units such as n gram word sequences and word pairs between the computer generated summary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries created by humans the rouge metric has multiple n for rogue w rogue l and may be applied at the word phrase or sentence level here rogue rogue rogue l rogue w are used as evaluation measures for comparing the proposed system with other existing systems the python rogue library was used for it three automated tools were chosen for comparison net text summarizer splitbrain splitbrain org services ots and along with this the text rank algorithm was also used to summarize the legal case file however it resulted in memory error due to computational complexity the rogue scores are as shown in the table table rogue scores comparison precision recall rogue measures proposed system textsummarizer splitbrain esummerizer f measure precision recall f measure precision recall f measure precision recall rogue l rogue w the proposed method in this paper performs favourably well against other existing methods since the proposed method is an unsupervised approach and is computationally favourably it does not require training any data or creating like it is required in some recently proposed the reason why the proposed system performs favourably well is due to the extraction of sentences having the highest tf idf scores and similarity to the title of the case not just from the entire case file but from each cluster of sentences obtained thus ensuring least redundancy and similarity between the sentences generated in the final summary so that the final summary that gets generated contains sentences which help in representing the entire case file with least redundancy f measure future work the preliminary results of the proposed system serve as a promising means of providing legal summaries of case files however the proposed approach can be further improved by making the following addition for determining the optimal number of clusters for k means certain algorithms can be added as an extension to the system for optimal for ranking the sentences after clustering other than tf idf and title similarity scores parameters like position of sentence in the document and others can be used along with integration of other algorithms like latent dirichlet algorithm or graphical based approaches to generate sentences which have a higher overall rank as an addition to the proposed system thematic roles and rhetorical roles can be implemented to provide a structure to the document like it is required for legal case briefs conclusions the proposed method works favorably well against existing approaches the summary generated closely resembles to the original summary as generated by the attorney of the case and can possibly be used in the court of law after further improvements the summary generated by the proposed system after further revisions and structuring can possibly be used by attorneys for real time cases in the near future after carrying out real world tests with attorneys which have not been conducted as of now since it is an unsupervised approach consisting of clustering using k means and extracting top ranked sentences from each cluster and is computationally favorable it provides a promising start towards developing a fully functional legal case summarizer references al hashemi r
