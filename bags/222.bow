summarization legal domain k means clustering tf idf word vectors keywords introduction information data increased tremendously field years limited human capacity consuming information paramount extract useful information vast unstructured data available text summarization plays important role extracting useful pieces information possibly large bodies text automatic text summarization process producing textual summaries output given certain textual document input computational power machine involves reducing text document short set words paragraph conveys main meaning need automatic text summarization field legal cases continuously increasing number cases piling courtroom currently lot effort goes manual drafting case headnotes synopses legal systems world generate massive amounts unstructured text day judges lawyers case workers process review millions cases year united states preparing legal case summary difficult task summary contain relevant facts precedents necessary persuade court favour plaintiff lawyers spend hours preparing legal briefs computer minutes automatic text summarization necessity overcome challenges paper novel hybrid approach automatic text

currently text summarization section contains description proposed method section consists information data implementation section approach compared existing tech bachelor student techniques text summarization insight performance proposed method section contains proposal future work section consists conclusion background summarization challenging sub task broader text text generation field natural language processing automatic text summarization broadly types extractive summarization method involves selecting useful relevant sentences document provide summary sentences originally present document form summary new sentences formed extractive summaries produce set significant sentences document exactly abstractive summarization type summarization new sentences formed relevant document gist document represented computer generated sentences having close resemblance summary produced humans abstractive text summarization captures salient features text summary generated words sentence input text lot research ongoing domain depending number documents given input broadly types single document summarization single document given input text summarization model summary document produced output useful relevant sentences entire document extracted form summary multi document summarization multi document text summarization defined process extracting relevant data creating short version multiple source document given input sentences best representing documents unit given output hybrid method proposed paper based extractive summarization single document legal case given input legal brief best representing useful relevant facts produced output legal brief produced serves important tool lawyers present case courtroom contain important information relevant case including facts events necessary win case important economical time spent actual reading case economical writing brief existing approaches different kinds methods proposed text summarization legal domain
