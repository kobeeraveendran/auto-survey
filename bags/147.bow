peking university china xu sun peking university china yi zhang peking university china xiaoyan cai northwestern polytechnical university china qi su peking university china abstractive text summarization is a highly difficult problem and the sequence to sequence model has shown success in improving the performance on the task however the generated summaries are often inconsistent with the source content in semantics in such cases when generating summaries the model selects semantically unrelated words with respect to the source content as the most probable output the problem can be attributed to heuristically constructed training data where summaries can be unrelated to the source content thus containing semantically unrelated words and spurious word correspondence in this paper we propose a regularization approach for the sequence to sequence model and make use of what the model has learned to regularize the learning objective to alleviate the effect of the problem in addition we propose a practical human evaluation method to address the problem that the existing automatic evaluation method does not evaluate the semantic consistency with the source content properly

chinese social media text natural language processing introduction abstractive test summarization is an important text generation task with the applying of the sequence to sequence model and the publication of large scale datasets the quality of the automatic generated summarization has been greatly improved chen et al chopra et al gu et al hu et al li et al mcauley and leskovec nallapati et al rush et al see et al however the semantic consistency of the automatically generated summaries is still far from satisfactory both authors contributed equally to the paper corresponding author

data with heuristic rules chopra et al hu et al nallapati et al the summaries are not written for the source content specifically it suggests that the provided summary may not be semantically consistent with the source content for example the dataset for chinese social media text summarization namely lcsts contains more than text summary pairs that are not related according to the statistics of the manually checked data et al table example of semantic inconsistency in the lcsts dataset in this example the reference summary can not be concluded from the source content because the semantics of the summary is not contained in the source text in short the semantics of benefits can not be concluded from the source content source content sec in the end after the hong kong stock exchange rejected the partnership equity structure of the alibaba group s different shareholding rights the alibaba group was forced to say goodbye to its former partners and turned to invest in the arms of the securities and exchange commission sec the picture below shows the alibaba empire reference summary alibaba will be listed again for whose benefits table shows an example of semantic inconsistency typically the reference summary contains extra information that can not be understood from the source content it is hard to conclude the summary even for a human due to the inconsistency the system can not extract enough information in the source text and it would be hard for the model to learn to generate the summary accordingly the model has to encode spurious correspondence of the summary and the source content by memorization however this kind of correspondence is superficial and is not actually needed for generating reasonable summaries moreover the information is harmful to generating semantically consistent summaries because unrelated information is modeled for example the word benefits in the summary is not related to the source content thus it has to be remembered by the model together with the source content however this correspondence is spurious because the word is not related to any word in the source content in the following we refer to this problem as spurious correspondence caused by the semantically inconsistent data in this work we aim to alleviate the impact of the semantic inconsistency of the current dataset based on the sequence to sequence model we propose a regularization method to heuristically show down the learning of the spurious correspondence so that the unrelated information in the dataset is less represented by the model we incorporate a new soft training target to achieve this goal for each output time in training in addition to the gold reference word the current output also targets at a softened output word distribution that regularizes the current output word distribution in this way a more robust correspondence of the source content and the output words can be learned and potentially the output summary will be more semantically consistent to obtain the softened output word distribution we propose two methods based on the to sequence model the first one uses the output layer of the decoder to generate the distribution but with a higher temperature when using softmax normalization it keeps the relative order of the possible output words but guides the model to keep a smaller discriminative margin for spurious correspondence across different examples the output distribution is more likely to be different so no effective discriminative margin will be established for true correspondence across different examples the output distribution is more likely to be the same so a margin can be gradually established the second one introduces an additional output layer to generate the distribution analogous to multi task learning the additional output layer provides an alternative view of the data so that it can regularize the output distribution more effectively because the additional output layer differs from the original one in that the less stable information i e the spurious correspondence learned by the model itself is represented differently besides the relative order can also be regularized in this method more detailed explanation is introduced in section another problem for abstractive text summarization is that the system summary can not be easily evaluated automatically rouge lin is widely used for summarization evaluation however as rouge is designed for extractive text summarization it can not deal with summary paraphrasing in abstractive text summarization besides as rouge is based on the reference it requires high quality reference summary for a reasonable evaluation which is also lacking in the existing dataset for chinese social media text summarization we argue that for proper evaluation of text generation task human evaluation can not be avoided we propose a simple and practical human evaluation for evaluating text summarization where the summary is evaluated against the source content instead of the reference it handles both of the problems of paraphrasing and lack of high quality reference the contributions of this work are summarized as follows we propose an approach to regularize the output word distribution so that the semantic inconsistency e words not related to the source content exhibited in the training data is derrepresented in the model we add a cross entropy based regularization term to the overall loss we also propose two methods to obtain the soft target distribution for regularization the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach which outperforms almost all the existing systems in particular the semantic consistency is improved by in terms of human evaluation we also conduct analysis to examine the effect of the proposed method on the output summaries and the output label distributions showing that the improved consistency results from the regularized output distribution we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency of the generated summary with the source content such kind of evaluation is absent in the existing work of text summarization in the proposed human evaluation the summary is evaluated against the source content other than the reference summary so that it can better measure the consistency of the generated summary and the source content when high quality reference is not available proposed method base on the fact that the spurious correspondence is not stable and its realization in the model is prone to change we propose to alleviate the issue heuristically by regularization we use the cross entropy with an annealed output distribution as the regularization term in the loss so that the little fluctuation in the distribution will be depressed and more robust and stable correspondence will be learned by correspondence we mean the relation between the current output and the source content and the partially generated output furthermore we propose to use an additional output layer to generate the annealed output distribution due to the same fact the two output layers will differ more in the words that superficially co occur so that the output distribution can be better regularized regularizing the neural network with annealed distribution typically in the training of the sequence to sequence model only the one hot hard target is used in the cross entropy based loss function for an example in the training set the loss of an output fig illustration of the proposed methods left self train right dual train vector j yi log zi m where z is the output vector y is the one hot hard target vector and m is the number of labels however as y is the one hot vector all the elements are zero except the one representing the correct label hence the loss becomes j z log zl where l is the index of the correct label the loss is then summed over the output sentences and across the minibatch and used as the source error signal in the backpropagation the hard target could cause several problems in the training soft training methods try to use a soft target distribution to provide a generalized error signal to the training for the summarization task a straight forward way would be to use the current output vector as the soft target which contains the knowledge learned by the current model i e the correspondence of the source content and the current output word then the two losses are combined as the new loss function j zi log zi m j z log zl zi log zi m where l is the index of the true label and is the strength of the soft training loss we refer to this approach as self train the left part of figure the output of the model can be seen as a refined supervisory signal for the learning of the model the added loss promotes the learning of more stable correspondence the output not only learns from the one hot distribution but also the distribution generated by the model itself however during the training the output of the neural network can become too close to the one hot distribution to solve this we make the soft target the soften output distribution we apply the softmax with temperature which is computed the convenience of description we omit the related trainable parameters of the model uses simplified notation where zi and zj should be the unnormalized output i e the output before the softmax operation i m trainencoderdecoderencoderdecoderdual train this transformation keeps the relative order of the labels and a higher temperature will make the output distributed more evenly the key motivation is that if the model is still not confident how to generate the current output word under the supervision of the reference summary it means the correspondence can be spurious and the reference output is unlikely to be concluded from the source content it makes no sense to force the model to learn such correspondence the regularization follows that motivation and in such case the error signal will be less significant compared to the one hot target in the case where the model is extremely confident how to generate the current output the annealed distribution will resemble the one hot target thus the regularization is not effective in all we make use of the model itself to identify the spurious correspondence and then regularize the output distribution accordingly dual output layers however the aforementioned method tries to regularize the output word distribution based on what it has already learned the relative order of the output words is kept the self dependency may not be desirable for regularization it may be better if more correspondence that is spurious can be identified in this paper we further propose to obtain the soft target from a different view of the model so that different knowledge of the dataset can be used to mitigate the overfitting problem an additional output layer is introduced to generate the soft target the two output layers share the same hidden representation but have independent parameters they could learn different knowledge of the data we refer to this approach as dual train for clarity the original output layer is denoted by and the new output layer their outputs are denoted by and respectively the output layer acts as the original output layer we apply soft training using the output from to this output layer to increase its ability of generalization suppose the correct label is l the target of the output includes both the one hot distribution and the distribution generated from j log l i log i m the new output layer is trained normally using the originally hard target this output layer is not used in the prediction and its only purpose is to generate the soft target to facilitate the soft training of suppose the correct label is l the target of the output includes only the one hot distribution j log l because of the random initialization of the parameters in the output layers and could learn different things the diversified knowledge is helpful when dealing with the spurious dence in the data it can also be seen as an online kind of ensemble methods several different instances of the same model are softly aggregated into one to make classification the right part of figure shows the architecture of the proposed dual train method experiments we evaluate the proposed approach on the chinese social media text summarization task based on the sequence to sequence model we also analyze the output text and the output label distribution of the models showing the power of the proposed approach finally we show the cases where the correspondences learned by the proposed approach are still problematic which can be explained based on the approach we adopt dataset large scale chinese short text summarization dataset lcsts is constructed by et al the dataset consists of more than million text summary pairs in total constructed from a famous chinese social media microblogging service the whole dataset is split into three parts with pairs in part i for training pairs in part ii for validation and pairs in part iii for testing the authors of the dataset have manually annotated the relevance scores ranging from to of the text summary pairs in part ii and part iii they suggested that only pairs with scores no less than three should be used for evaluation which leaves pairs in part ii and pairs in part iii from the statistics of the part ii and part iii we can see that more than of the pairs are dropped to maintain semantic quality it indicates that the training set which has not been manually annotated and checked contains a huge quantity of unrelated text summary pairs experimental settings we use the sequence to sequence model sutskever et al with attention bahdanau et al jean et al luong et al mi et al as the baseline both the encoder and decoder are based on the single layer lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber the word embedding size is and the hidden state size of the lstm unit is we conduct experiments on the word level to convert the character sequences into word sequences we use to segment the words the same with the existing work gu et al hu et al self train and dual train are implemented based on the baseline model with two more parameters the temperature and the soft training strength we use a very simple setting for all tasks and set we pre train the model without applying the soft training objective for epochs out of total epochs we use the adam optimizer kingma and ba for all the tasks using the default settings with and in testing we use beam search to generate the summaries and the beam size is set to we report the test results at the epoch that achieves the best score on the development set evaluation protocol for text summarization a common automatic evaluation method is rouge lin the ated summary is evaluated against the reference summary based on unigram recall bigram recall and recall of longest common subsequence rouge l to facilitate comparison with the existing systems we adopt rouge as the automatic evaluation method the rouge is calculated on the character level following the previous work et al however for abstractive text summarization the rouge is sub optimal and can not assess the semantic consistency between the summary and the source content especially when there is only one reference for a piece of text the reason is that the same content may be expressed in different ways with different focuses simple word match can not recognize the paraphrasing it is the case for all of the existing large scale datasets besides as aforementioned rouge is calculated on the character level in chinese text summarization making the metrics favor the models on the character level in practice in chinese a word is the smallest semantic element that can be uttered in isolation not a character in the extreme case the generated text could be completely intelligible but the characters could still match in theory calculating rouge metrics on the word level could alleviate the problem however word segmentation is also a non trivial task for chinese there are many kinds of segmentation rules which will produce different rouge scores we argue that it com python org pypi is not acceptable to introduce additional systematic bias in automatic evaluations and automatic evaluation for semantically related tasks can only serve as a reference to avoid the deficiencies we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference if the candidate is irrelevant or incorrect to the text or the candidate is not understandable the candidate is labeled bad otherwise the candidate is labeled good then we can get an accuracy of the good summaries the proposed evaluation is very simple and straight forward it focuses on the relevance between the summary and the text the semantic consistency should be the major consideration when putting the text summarization methods into practice but the current automatic methods can not judge properly for detailed guidelines in human evaluation please refer to appendix a in the human evaluation the text summary pairs are dispatched to two human annotators who are native speakers of chinese as in our setting the summary is evaluated against the reference the number of the pairs needs to be manually evaluated is four times the number of the pairs in the test set because we need to compare four systems in total to decrease the workload and get a hint about the annotation quality at the same time we adopt the following procedure we first randomly select pairs in the validation set for the two human annotators to evaluate each pair is annotated twice and the inter annotator agreement is checked we find that under the protocol the inter annotator agreement is quite high in the evaluation of the test set a pair is only annotated once to accelerate evaluation to further maintain consistency summaries of the same source content will not be distributed to different annotators experimental results table results of the human evaluation showing how many summaries are semantically consistent with their source content the generated summary is evaluated directly against the source content good total accuracy methods reference baseline self train dual train first we show the results for human evaluation which focuses on the semantic consistency of the summary with its source content we evaluate the systems implemented by us as well as the reference we can not conduct human evaluations for the existing systems from other work because the output summaries needed are not available for us besides the baseline system we implemented is very competitive in terms of rouge and achieves better performance than almost all the existing systems the results are listed in table it is surprising to see that the accuracy of the reference summaries does not reach it means that the test set still contains text summary pairs of poor quality even after removing the pairs with relevance scores lower than as suggested by the authors of the dataset as we can see dual train improves the accuracy by due to the rigorous definition of being good the results mean that more of the summaries are semantically consistent with their source content however self train has a performance drop compared to the baseline after investigating its generated summaries we find that the major reason is that the generated summaries are not grammatically complete and often stop too early although the generated part is indeed more related to the source content because the definition of being good the improved relevance does not make up the loss on intelligibility table comparisons with the existing models in terms of rouge metrics methods rnn context et al srb ma et al copynet gu et al rnn distract chen et al drgd li et al baseline ours self train ours dual train ours rouge l then we compare the automatic evaluation results in table as we can see only applying soft training without adaptation self train hurts the performance with the additional output layer dual train the performance can be greatly improved over the baseline moreover with the proposed method the simple baseline model is second to the best compared with the state of the art models and even surpasses in it is promising that applying the proposed method to the state of the art model could also improve its performance the automatic evaluation is done on the original test set to facilitate comparison with existing work however a more reasonable setting would be to exclude the test instances that are found bad in the human evaluation because the quality of the automatic evaluation depends on the reference summary as the existing methods do not provide their test output it is a non trivial task to reproduce all their results of the same reported performance nonetheless it does not change the fact that rouge can not handle the issues in abstractive text summarization properly experimental analysis to examine the effect of the proposed method and reveal how the proposed method improves the consistency we compare the output of the baseline with dual train based on both the output text and the output label distribution we also conduct error analysis to discover room for improvements analysis of the output text to gain a better understanding of the results we analyze the summaries generated by the baseline model and our proposed model some of the summaries are listed in table as shown in the table the summaries generated by the proposed method are much better than the baseline and we believe they are more precise and informative than the references in the first one the baseline system generates a grammatical but unrelated summary while the proposed method generates a more informative summary in the second one the baseline system generates a related but ungrammatical summary while the proposed method generates a summary related to the source content but different from the reference we believe the generated summary is actually better than the reference because the focus of the visit is not the event itself but its purpose in the third one the baseline system generates a related and grammatical summary but the facts stated are completely incorrect the summary generated by the proposed method is more comprehensive than the reference while the reference only includes the facts in the last sentence of the source content in short the generated summary of the proposed method is more consistent with the source content it also exhibits the necessity of the proposed human evaluation because when the generated summary is evaluated against the reference it may seem redundant or wrong but it is actually true to the source content while it is arguable that the generated summary is better than the reference table examples of the summaries generated by the baseline and dual train from the test set as we can see the summaries generated by the proposed are much better than the ones generated by the baseline and even more informative and precise than the references short text china railway news starting from january bikes can not be carried onto the

countries baseline global competitiveness report china ranks the eighth in the world proposal global competitiveness report switzerland takes the first place china ranks the there is no doubt that the generated summary of the proposed method is better than the baseline however the improvement can not be properly shown by the existing evaluation methods furthermore the examples suggest that the proposed method does learn better correspondence the highlighted words in each example in table share almost the same previous words however in the first one the baseline considers stop as the most related words which is a sign of noisy word relations learned from other training examples while the proposed method generates to the platform which is more related to what a human thinks it is the same with the second example where a human selects expert and dual train selects worker while the baseline selects research and fails to generate a grammatical sentence later in the third one the reference and the baseline use the same word while dual train chooses a word of the same meaning it can be concluded that dual train indeed learns better word relations that could generalize to the test set and good word relations can guide the decoder to generate semantically consistent summaries analysis of the output label distribution to show why the generated text of the proposed method is more related to the source content we further analyze the label distribution i e the word distribution generated by the first output layer from which the output word is selected to illustrate the relationship we calculate a representation for each word based on the label distributions each representation is associated with a specific label word denoted by l and each dimension i shows how likely the label indexed by i will be generated instead of the label to get such representation we run the model on the training set and get the output vectors table examples of the labels and their top most related labels the highlighted words indicate problematic word relations the baseline system encodes semantically unrelated words into the word relations while the proposed method learns the relatedness more precisely and robustly top most related labels label word proposal china nationwide nation domestic baseline china nationwide domestic the state council our country proposal motor

railway in the decoder which are then averaged with respect to their corresponding labels to form a representation we can obtain the most related words of a word by simply selecting the highest values from its representation table lists some of the labels and the top labels that are most likely to replace each of the labels it is a hint about the correspondence learned by the model from the results it can be observed that dual train learns the better semantic relevance of a word compared to the baseline because the spurious word correspondence is alleviated by regularization for example the possible substitutes of the word how long considered by dual train include how many how long and time however the relatedness is learned poorly in the baseline as there is know a number and two particles in the possible substitutes considered by the baseline another representative example is the word image where the baseline also includes two particles in its most related words the phenomenon shows that the baseline suffers from spurious correspondence in the data and learns noisy and harmful relations which rely too much on the co occurrence in contrast the proposed method can capture more stable semantic relatedness of the words for text summarization grouping the words that are in the same topic together can help the model to generate sentences that are more coherent and can improve the quality of the summarization and the relevance to the source content although the proposed method resolves a large number of the noisy word relations there are still cases that the less related words are not eliminated for example the top most similar words of futures industry from the proposed method include reform it is more related than from the baseline but it can still be harmful to text summarization the problem could arise from the fact that words as rarely occur in the training data and their relatedness is not reflected in the data another issue is that there are some particles e de in the most related words a possible explanation is that particles show up too often in the contexts of the word and it is hard for the models to distinguish them from the real semantically related words as our proposed approach is based on regularization of the less common correspondence it is reasonable that such kind of relation can not be eliminated the first case can be categorized into data sparsity which usually needs the aid of knowledge bases to solve the second case is due to the characteristics of natural language however as such words are often closed class words the case can be resolved by manually restricting the relatedness of these words related work related work includes efforts on designing models for the chinese social media text summarization task and the efforts on obtaining soft training target for supervised learning systems for chinese social media text summarization the large scale chinese short text summarization dataset was proposed by et al along with the datasets et al also proposed two systems to solve the task namely rnn and rnn context they were two sequence to sequence based models with gru as the encoder and the decoder the difference between them was that rnn context had attention mechanism while rnn did not they conducted experiments both on the character level and on the word level rnn distract chen et al was a distraction based neural model where the attention mechanism focused on different parts of the source content copynet gu et al incorporated a copy mechanism to allow part of the generated summary to be copied from the source content the copy mechanism also explained that the results of their word level model were better than the results of their character level model srb ma et al was a sequence to sequence based neural model to improve the semantic relevance between the input text and the output summary drgd li et al was a deep recurrent generative decoder model combining the decoder with a variational autoencoder methods for obtaining soft training target soft target aims to refine the supervisory signal in supervised learning related work includes soft target for traditional learning algorithms and model distillation for deep learning algorithms the soft label methods are typically for binary classification nguyen et al where the human annotators not only assign a label for an example but also give information on how confident they are regarding the annotation the main difference from our method is that the soft label methods require additional annotation information e the confidence information of the annotated labels of the training data which is costly in the text summarization task there have also been prior studies on model distillation in deep learning that distills big models into a smaller one model distillation hinton et al combined different instances of the same model into a single one it used the output distributions of the previously trained models as the soft target distribution to train a new model a similar work to model distillation is the soft target regularization method aghajanyan for image classification instead of using the outputs of other instances it used an exponential average of the past label distributions of the current instance as the soft target distribution the proposed method is different compared with the existing model distillation methods in that the proposed method does not require additional models or additional space to record the past soft label distributions the existing methods are not suitable for text summarization tasks because the training of an additional model is costly and the additional space is huge due to the massive number of data the proposed method uses its current state as the soft target distribution and eliminates the need to train additional models or to store the history information conclusions we propose a regularization approach for the sequence to sequence model on the chinese social media summarization task in the proposed approach we use a cross entropy based regularization term to make the model neglect the possible unrelated words we propose two methods for obtaining the soft output word distribution used in the regularization of which dual train proves to be more effective experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the semantic consistency by in terms of human evaluation as shown by the analysis the proposed method achieves the improvements by eliminating the less semantically related word correspondence the proposed human evaluation method is effective and efficient in judging the semantic sistency which is absent in previous work but is crucial in the accurate evaluation of the text summarization systems the proposed metric is simple to conduct and easy to interpret it also provides an insight on how practicable the existing systems are in the real world scenario a standard for human evaluation table examples for

the source content based on the goodness of the summary if the summary is not understandable relevant or correct according to the source content the summary is considered bad more concretely the annotators are asked to examine the following aspects to determine whether the summary is good fluency if the summary itself can not be understood the summary is not good this is not judged by grammatical correctness but by checking if major semantic roles such as the predicate the agent and the experiencer are missing it allows the summary where certain particles e or aspect markers e are missing but the content can still be understood another common issue is that the summary may have repeated words our view on this is that if the repetition does not affect the intelligibility of the summary we still treat the summary as good relatedness if it is impossible to decide whether the summary is correct or wrong according to the source content the summary is bad by definition the nonsense is also ruled out faithfulness if the summary is not correct according to the source content the summary is labeled bad we also treat the summary that is relevant and correct according to the source content but is too general as bad if a rule is not met the summary is labeled bad and the following rules do not need to be checked in table we give examples for cases of each rule in the first
