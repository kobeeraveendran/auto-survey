retrieval work present framework rst step automatic intellect aims assembling mind map based incoming text streams subject verb object strategy having verb interconnection adjacent nouns mind map performance enriched pronoun resolution engine bases work introduction text stream data lost read stream occurs practice example reading text listening story probably told cases human beings store major incidents associative remove noise extract information relevant redundant obvious relevant information connected adaptively meaning information read listened association occurred words increases decreases case performance inconsiderable information gets lost important facts kept important constructive processing like generation summarisation text retrieve contents manageable incremental adaptive mind maps serve similar way simulate human formance associative incremental adaptive architecture process incoming data streams adapt internal structures depending given input strengthen weaken internal connections send longer established connections simulating long term memory respect base work given argues real time approach nding associative relationships categorical entities transactional data streams technically categorical entities resented connectionist cells associations represented links links stronger time degrade according tion occurs observed work suggests layer architecture rst layer short term memory treats incoming signals structs associations second layer called long term memory stores associations strong connection useful analysis layer action layer serves communication interface user consult actual state system interact generation mind map complicated fact incoming text corrupt ambiguous example pronouns produce ambiguity existing referenced persons text having president united states said succeeding furthermore mentioned leads undoubtedly person recognition relationships natural relationships unsolved mind map ineective wrong respect meaningful intended mind map described work concerns resolution pronouns inspired earlier work notably syntax based approach possible candidates pronoun evaluated set salience factors example recency subject emphasis candidate highest salience weight chosen antecedent presents similar approach candidates evaluated indicators syntactic semantic information sentence needed furthermore mind map concerns temporal management text streams construct actor based structure architecture mind map motivation pronoun resolution semantic network learning correct antecedent pronoun important construct complete mind maps actor text text stream treated sliding window rst buers processes certain number sentences consequence information read gets lost sentence sliding window pre dened subject verb object structure instantiated arranged semantic work structure having concepts connections connections stronger weaker according underlying text stream occurrence subject verb object instantiation figure shows general architecture mind map complete text sentence preprocessed order syntactic semantic mation text treat input fact pronouns substitutes nouns text example pronoun refers harry
