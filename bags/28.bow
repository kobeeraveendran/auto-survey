has been based on hypothesis that are both enabling and limiting some of these limitations are how to take into account and reflect in the generated summary the implicit information conveyed in the text the author intention the reader intention the context influence the general world knowledge thus if we want machines to mimic human abilities then they will need access to this same large variety of knowledge the implicit is affecting the orientation and the argumentation of the text and consequently its summary most of text summarizers ts are processing as compressing the initial data and they necessarily suffer from information loss ts are focusing on features of the text only not on what the author intended or why the reader is reading the text in this paper we address this problem and we present a system focusing on acquiring knowledge that is implicit we principally spotlight the implicit information conveyed by the argumentative connectives such as but even yet and their effect on the summary keywords automatic summarization implicit data topoi topos argumentation i introduction nowadays text summarization has become widely used on the internet users of text summarization are countless they can be simple internet surfers searching for different news learners looking for specific educational materials or scientists exploring particular publications text summarization can help those users identify in a short time by reducing a large amount of information to a summary which documents are most relevant to their needs but there is widespread agreement that summarization that reduces a large volume of information to a summary preserving only the most essential items the human summarization is the process that given a document one tries to understand interpret abstract it and finally generate a new document as its summary is a very hard process indeed so far and trying to reach human capabilities research in automatic summarization has been based on hypothesis that are both enabling and limiting some of these limitations are how to take into account and reflect in the generated summary the implicit information conveyed in the text the author intention the reader intention the context influence the general world knowledge thus if we want machines to mimic human abilities then they will need access to this same large variety of knowledge most of text summarizers ts are processing as compressing the initial data and they necessarily suffer from information loss ts are focusing on features of the text only not on what the author intended or why the reader is reading the text thus a ts system must identify important parts and preserve them in this paper we will focus on acquiring knowledge that is implicit in the data and how to preserve it when generating the summary the system we present generate argumentative text based on the implicit stored data conveyed by the argumentative connectives such as nevertheless therefore but little a little when those connectives appear in sentences they impose constraints on the argumentative movement this movement is based on gradual rules of inference denoted by topoi the paper is organized as follows in section we give an overview of the state of the art on text summarization section reports on the theory of argumentation within language awl on which is based our implicit extractor in section we describe our system architecture in conclusion we summarize the contributions of this paper and introduce future research directions ii text summarization a types of summarizers text summarization is now an established field of natural researchers and language processing attracting many developers we can distinguish two types of summarizers based on the volume of text to be summarized sds is performed for a single if single document summarization summarization text document then it is called as the single document text summarization mutli document summarization mds if the summary is to be created for multiple text documents then text it summarization the multi document is called as b summarization techniques techniques may vary depending on the summarization type when considering the single document summarization we can cite the most important techniques sentences extracting this technique relies on trivial features of sentences such as word frequency presence of keywords and sentence position or a combination of such features www ijacsa thesai org p a g e ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no identification of the relevant information permitting to generate a textual summary from the facts that need to be included however when dealing with multi document summarization we can talk about extractive summarization involves assigning scores to some units e sentences paragraphs of the documents and extracting those with highest scores technique this abstractive summarization technique usually needs information fusion sentence compression and reformulation this iii how connectives are affecting sentence orientation a introduction in order to show the importance of the connective on the orientation of the sentence and on its general meaning we used lsa tool colorado to compare two apparently same sentences lsa is a theory and a method for extracting and representing the contextual usage meaning of words by statistical computation lsa measures of similarity are considered highly correlated with human meaning similarities among words and texts moreover it successfully imitates human word selection and category judgments example let us consider the two following sentences the weather is beautiful but i have to work i have to work but the weather is beautiful with lsa the two sentences will be represented with the same semantic vectors fig because for lsa the words like i to but are ignored and the word order is not take into account utterance articulators such as nevertheless therefore but little a little when those articulators appear in utterances they impose on constraints on the argumentative movement this movement is based on gradual rules of inference denoted by topoi according is an argumentative rule shared by a given community which need have no more members than the speaker and the hearer topoi are the guarantors of the passage from the argument to the conclusion topoi are used to license the move from an argument to a conclusion to and a topos a topos singular of topoi is presented as general in the sense that the speaker implicates that the topos holds for other situations it is not particular for the situation where it is used presented as shared in the sense that the speaker considers that the is accepted at least by the audience gradual the canonical two argumentative scales the argument antecedent and the conclusion consequent form of includes topos the each scale is marked on plus or on minus from which the next topical forms are concluded p p p and p if we believe p we necessarily believe p and in the same way for p p to illustrate the presentation above let us consider the the weather is beautiful but i have to work the antecedent uses a such as weather is beautiful plus we want to go the conclusion uses a topos such as i have a work to do minus i go the use of but in the utterance influences its argumentative orientation and the all utterance orientation will be the orientation of the conclusion let us now consider together the two sentences of according to the awl the two sentences have opposite argumentative orientations fig comparison of colorado two sentences similarity comparison but we agree that the two sentences argue to two different conclusions so it is definitely the impact of ignoring the connective but b argumentation within language theory the argumentation within language theory awl has been concerned with the analysis of the argumentative from indeed for the sentence if the antecedent uses topos like beautiful weather and the conclusion uses topos like work then the presence of but imposes that the sentence have the argumentative orientation of the conclusion i e outing however for the sentence and with the same reasoning its argumentative orientation is outing to end this illustration we note the importance of but in the sense that it imposes the argumentative orientation of the sentence this importance of connectives was already www ijacsa thesai org p a g e revealed by different works on natural language process such as in interclausal connectives carry meaning they connect textual meanings at both local and global levels and they mark discourse continuity and discontinuity both in the text and as inferred by the reader connectives can shape the actual meaning of the text they can also serve as efficient markers for instructions in the communicative process established between writer and reader after this short outline on the theory of the argumentation within language in the next section we give a description of the architecture of an argumentative single document summarizer asds iv system architecture this section gives an overview of the asds architecture and describes the functions of its various components the global architecture is represented in figure it is composed of three layers of software the data pre processor the constraints generator and the summary generator fig asds architecture the pre processing layer aims at extracting connective language elements asds uses gate a natural processing system the generator constraints layer generate constraints based on the connectives constraints and the topos base it permits to annotate the relevant sentences in the text in our work we consider the sentence as the basic extraction unit the connective constraints determine the type of argumentative relation between the argument and the conclusion whether an argument conclusion relation or argument anti argument the base is used to link arguments to conclusions this base allows two arguments across scales since a topos is gradual as discussed above the comparison of we notice that the proposed summarization is focused on single document texts where argumentation takes an important to filter sentence place the summary generator aims according to the constraints predetermined by the constraints generator the algorithm below gives the different steps of summary generation ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no identify all sentences of the document d calculate sentences score with respect to their importance for the overall understanding of the text this ranking is based on key words and connectives sentences with connectives are weighted contrary to other key words are determined by their frequency in the sentences document a word sentence matrix is generated where the column represents the sentences and the row represents the words words with maximum frequency are considered as key words calculate the score for each sentence using a formula using the key words weight and connectives weight sn wn ww cw score where cw is the weight of connectives and ww is the weight of key words rank the sentences in the decreasing order of calculated scores apply connectives constraints on sentences including connectives to generate conclusions top ranked sentences and generated conclusions are combined in sequence as document summary v future work in the present work we showed the role of connectives in argumentative texts when dealing with the orientation of the whole text the analysis of these connectives indicates the existence of specific values intentionally assigned to them by the writer named topoi as future work we plan to investigate the topoi base many works need to be conducted especially how this base will be initialized and how it will be updated we would like to continue the implementation of asds to apply our approach moreover choosing argumentative texts to be used as input to our system needs further investigation vi conclusion in this paper we showed the role of connectives in argumentative texts when dealing with the orientation of the whole text the analysis of these connectives indicates the existence of specific values intentionally assigned to them by the writer for example but was shown to be functioning in sentence to impose constraints on the conclusion intended by the writer some recent trends of investigation support www ijacsa thesai org p a g e ijacsa international journal of
