c e d v g l p m c v i x r a multi document summarization by graph search and matching inderjeet mani the mitre corporation colshire drive mclean va usa org eric bloedorn the mitre corporation colshire drive mclean va usa org abstract we describe a new method for summarizing ities and dierences in a pair of related documents using a graph representation for text concepts noted by words phrases and proper names in the document are represented positionally as nodes in the graph along with edges corresponding to semantic lations between items given a perspective in terms of which the pair of documents is to be summarized the algorithm rst uses a spreading activation technique to discover in each document nodes semantically related to the topic the activated graphs of each document are then matched to yield a graph corresponding to similarities and dierences between the pair which is rendered in natural language an evaluation of these techniques has been carried out with the mushrooming of the quantity of on line text information triggered in part by the growth of the world wide web it is especially useful to have tools which can help users digest information content text summarization attempts to address this problem by taking a partially structured source text extracting information content from it and presenting the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs in exploiting summarization many modern information retrieval applications need marization systems which scale up to large volumes of unrestricted text in such applications a common problem which arises is the existence of multiple uments covering similar information as in the case of multiple news stories about an event or a sequence of events a particular challenge for text summarization is to be able to summarize the similarities and ences in information content among these documents in a way that is sensitive to the needs of the user in order to address this challenge a suitable sentation for content must be developed most able text summarization systems which aim at bility e echosearch rau kupiec et al provide a capability to extract tences or other units that match the relevance criteria used by the system however they do nt attempt to understand the concepts in the text and their ships in short they do nt represent the meaning of the text in the ideal case the meaning of each text would be made up say of the meanings of sentences in the text which in turn would be made up of the ings of words while the ideal case is currently sible beyond a small fragment of a natural language it is possible to arrive at approximate representations of meaning in this paper we propose an approach to scalable text summarization which builds an abstract content representation based on explicitly ing entities and the relations between entities of the sort that can be robustly extracted by current mation extraction systems here concepts described in a document denoted by text items such as words phrases and proper names are represented ally as nodes in a graph along with edges ing to semantic and topological relations between cepts the relations between concepts are whatever relations can be feasibly extracted in the context of the scalability requirements of an application these include specialization relationships e which can be extracted based on a thesaurus as well as association relationships such as relationships between people and organizations or coreference relationships between tities salient regions of the graph can then be input to further synthesis processing to eventually yield natural language summaries which can in general go well beyond extracts to abstracts or it is also important to note that in computing a salience function for text items most eldable text summarization systems do not typically deal with the context sensitive nature of the summarization task a user may have an interest in a particular topic which may make particular text units more salient to vide a degree of context sensitivity the summarization algorithm described here takes a parameter specifying the topic or perspective with respect to which the american association for articial the implementation at the time of writing is intelligence www aaai org all rights reserved conned to extracts summary should be generated this topic represents a set of entry points nodes into the graph to termine which items are salient the graph is searched for nodes semantically related to the topic using a spreading activation technique this approach diers from other network approaches such as the use of ral nets the hopeld net approach discussed in chen et al in two ways rst the structure of our graph reects both semantic relations derived from text as well as linear order in the text the latter via the positional encoding the linear order is especially important for natural language second as will be claried below the set of nodes which become highly activated is a function of link type and distance from entry nodes unlike other approaches which use a xed bound on the number of nodes or convergence to a stable state of course if we are able to discover given a topic and a pair of related documents nodes in each ument semantically related to the topic then these nodes and their relationships can be compared to tablish similarities and dierences between the ment pair given a pair of related news stories about an event or a sequence of events the problem of nding similarities and dierences becomes one of comparing graphs which have been activated by a common topic in practice candidate common topics can be selected from the intersection of the activated concepts in each graph i e which will be denoted by words phrases or names this allows dierent summaries to be ated based on the choice of common topic algorithm fsd graphs find similarities and dierences takes a pair of such activated graphs and compares them to yield similarities and dierences the results are then subject to synthesis processing to yield document summaries these graph construction and manipulation niques are highly scalable in that they yield useful summaries in a reasonable time when applied to large quantities of unrestricted text of the kind found on the world wide web in what follows we rst scribe the graph representation and the tools used to build it followed by a description of the graph search and graph matching algorithms we also provide an evaluation which assesses the usefulness of a variety of dierent graph based multi document summarization algorithms representing meaningful text content a text is represented as a graph as shown in ure each node represents an underlying concept responding to a word occurrence and has a distinct input position associated with each such node is a feature vector characterizing the various features of the word in that position as shown in part of the gure a node can have adjacency links adj to textually jacent nodes same links to other occurrences of the same concept and other links corresponding to adj alpha same phrase adj adj name adj adj coref adj adj name figure graph representation tic relationships represented by alpha to be discussed below phrase links tie together sequences of jacent nodes which belong to a phrase part in part we show a name link as well as the coref link between subgraphs relating positions of name currences which are coreferential name links can be specialized to dierent types e person province the concepts denoted by phrases and names cated by ellipses around subgraphs in figure are tinguished from the concepts denoted by words which make up the phrases and names tools for building document graphs our experiments make use of a sentence and graph tagger which contains a very extensive expression based sentence boundary disambiguator aberdeen et al the boundary tion module is part of a comprehensive preprocess pipeline which utilizes a list of abbreviations and a series of hand crafted rules to identify sentence aries then the alembic part of speech tagger erdeen et al is invoked on the text this ger uses the rule sequence learning approach of brill names and relationships between names are then extracted from the document using sra s towl krupka a system then salient words and phrases are extracted from the text using the tf idf metric which makes use of a reference corpus derived from the trec harman the weight dwik of term in document i is given by dwik tfik trained on about words of wall street journal text the tagger obtained accuracy on a arate test set of words of wsj aberdeen et al sentence level score plot for peru reuters txt graph peru reuters txt

weights from raw graph reuters news figure activation weights from graph after ing activation reuters news topic tupac amaru where tfik frequency of term in document i dfk number of documents in the reference corpus in which term k occurs n total number of documents in the reference corpus phrases are useful in summarization as they often ten denote signicant concepts and thus can be good indicators and descriptors of salient regions of text our phrase extraction method nds candidate phrases using several patterns dened over part of speech tags one pattern for example uses the maximal sequence of one or more adjectives followed by one or more nouns once stop words are ltered out the weight of a candidate phrase is the average of the tf idf weights of remaining i e content words in the phrase plus a factor which adds a small bonus in proportion to the length of the phrase to extract more specic phrases we use a contextual parameter to avoid redundancy among phrases by selecting each term in a phrase at most once the weight of a phrase w of length n tent words in document i is i p n dwik n where is if the word has been seen before and otherwise we now discuss the alpha links association lations between concepts are based on what is vided by netowl for example bill gates president of microsoft will give rise to the link president between the person and the organization in lieu of ization links between concepts we initially took the simple approach of pre computing the semantic tance links between pairs of words using wordnet miller based on the relative height of the most specic common ancestor class of the two words ject to a context dependent class weighting parameter for example for the texts in figure the words idence and house are very close because a sense of residence in wordnet has house as an immediate pernym this technique is known to be oversensitive to the structure of the thesaurus to improve matters the corpus sensitive approach of resnick see also smeaton and quigley using the reference corpus has also been implemented however the full exploitation of this along with suitable tion techniques will have to await further research graph search by spreading activation the goal of the spreading activation algorithm derived from the method of chen et al is to nd all those nodes that are semantically linked to the given activated nodes the search for semantically related text is performed by spreading from topic words to other document nodes via a variety of link types as scribed previously document nodes whose strings are equivalent to topic terms using a stemming procedure stem are treated as entry points into the graph the weight of neighboring nodes is dependent on the type of node link travelled for adjacent links node weight is an exponentially decaying function of activating node weight and the distance between nodes distances are scaled so that travelling across sentence boundaries is more expensive than travelling within a sentence but less than travelling across paragraph boundaries for the other link types the neighboring weight is lated as a function of link weight and activating node weight the method iteratively nds neighbors to the given starting nodes using stem in matching strings associated with nodes pushes the activating nodes on the output stack and the new nodes on the active stack and repeats until a system dened threshold on the number of output nodes is met or all nodes have been reached as an example we show the the average weights of nodes at dierent sentence positions in the raw graph in figure the results after spreading given the topic tupac amaru are shown in figure the spreading has changed the activation weight surface so that some new related peaks have emerged e sentence and old peaks have been reduced e sentence which had a high tf idf score but was not related to tupac amaru the exponential decay function is also dent in the neighborhoods of the peaks unlike much previous use of spreading activation methods for query expansion as a part of tion retrieval salton and buckley chen et al our use of spreading activation is to reweight the words in the document rather than to decide for each word whether it should be included or not the later synthesis module determines the ultimate selection of nodes based on node weight as well as its relationship to other nodes as a result we partially insulate the summary from the potential sensitivity of the ing to the choice of starting nodes and search extent for example we would get the same results for tupac amaru as the topic as with mrta further this means the spreader need not capture all nodes that are vant to a summary directly but only to suggest new regions of the input text that may not immediately appear to be related this has distinct advantages compared to certain information retrieval methods which simply nd gions of the text similar to the query for example the reuters sentence plotted in figure and shown in figure might have been found via an information retrieval method which matched on the query tupac amaru allowing for mrta as an abbreviated alias for the name however it would have not found other formation related to the tupac amaru in the reuters article the spreading method follows a link from tupac amaru to release in sentence via adj to other stances of release via the same link eventually ing sentence where release is adj to the name tor polay the group s leader likewise the algorithm spreads to sentences and in that article which mention mrta but not tupac amaru in the ap cle a thesaurus link becomes more useful in ing a similar connection it is able to nd a direct link from tupac amaru to leaders via adj in sentence and from there to its synonym chief in sentence via alpha which is adj to victor summarizing multiple documents by graph matching the goal of fsd graphs is to nd the concepts which best describe the similarities and dierences in the given regions of text it does this by rst ing which concepts nodes are common and which are dierent the computation of common nodes given graphs and is given by common ferences are computed by dif f erences common concept g holds if there is a in g such that either or the user may provide a threshold on the minimal number of uniquely ered concepts or on the minimal coverage weight currently the synthesis module simply outputs the set of sentences covering the shared terms and the set of sentences covering the unique terms hilighting the shared and unique terms in each and indicating which document the sentence came from this is something course the relation could also be found if the system could correctly interpret the expressions its chief in the ap article and their leader in the reuters article sentence level score plot for peru nando txt spread graph peru nando txt spread graph data t h g i e w t i n u sentence position figure activation weights from spread graph ap news topic tupac amaru of a fallback arrangement as the abstraction built is not represented to the user in the next phase of search we expect to better exploit the concepts in the text their semantic relations and concepts from the thesaurus to link extracts into abstracts sentence selection is based on the coverage of nodes in the common and dierent lists sentences are ily selected based on the average activated weight of the covered words for a sentence its score in terms of coverage of common nodes is given by where s the score for dierences is lar the user may specify the maximal number of tences in a particular category common or dierent to control which sentences are output as an example consider the application of graphs to the activated graph in figure the reuters article and an activated graph in figure an ap article of the same date describing the same hostage crisis the activated graphs had words in mon out of words for the former graph and for the latter the algorithm extracts ties with the commonalities with the strongest ations being on top the high scoring commonalities and dierences are the ones shown in figure the gorithm discovers that both articles talk about victor polay e the reuters sentence mentioned earlier and the ap sentence fujimori japanese sador residence and cabinet notice that the system is able to extract commonalities without tupac amaru being directly present regarding dierences the rithm discovers that the ap article is the only one to explain how the rebels posed as waiters sentence and the reuters article is the only one which told how the rebels once had public sympathy sentence evaluation eectiveness of spreading activation graph search methods for evaluating text summarization approaches can broadly classied into two categories the rst is an extrinsic evaluation in which the quality of the mary is judged based on how it eects the completion metric accuracy precision recall time mins usefulness of text in deciding relevance to usefulness of text in deciding irrelevance to preference for more or less text full text too much text summary just right table summaries versus full text task accuracy time and user feedback condition without spreading with spreading without subgraph extraction table mean ratings of multi document summaries commonalities dierences of some other task the second approach an sic evaluation judges the quality of the summarization directly based on user judgements of informativeness coverage in our evaluation we performed both type of experiments in our extrinsic evaluation we evaluated the ness of graph search spreading in the context of an information retrieval task in this experiment jects were informed only that they were involved in a timed information retrieval research experiment in each run a subject was presented with a pair of query and document and asked to determine whether the document was relevant or irrelevant to the query in one experimental condition the document shown was the full text in the other the document shown was a summary generated with the top sentences subjects four altogether were rotated across experimental ditions but no subject was in both conditions for the same query document pair we hypothesized that if the summarization was useful it would result in ings in time without signicant loss in accuracy four queries were preselected from the trec man collection of topics with the idea of ploiting their associated binary relevance judgments these were where are the nuclear power plants in the u s and what has been their rate of tion what are the prospects of the bec separatists achieving independence from the rest of canada how widespread is the illegal posal of medical waste in the u s and what is being done to combat this dumping and why is the infant mortality rate in the united states higher than it is in most other industrialized a subset of the trec collection of documents was indexed using the smart retrieval system from nell buckley using smart the top hits from each query was reserved for the experiment overall each subject was presented with four batches of query document pairs i e documents were a trec query and a document to be rized the entry nodes for spreading activation are those document nodes which are to non stop word terms found in the trec query presented to each subject with a questionnaire after each batch accuracy metrics in information retrieval include precision percentage of retrieved documents that are relevant i e number retrieved which were relevant total number retrieved and recall age of relevant documents that are retrieved i e ber retrieved which were relevant total number known to be relevant in table we show the average precision and erage recall over all queries relevance decisions altogether the table shows that when the summaries were used the performance was faster than with text p using analysis of variance f test without signicant loss of accuracy while we would expect shorter texts to take less time to read it is striking that these short extracts on average one seventh of the length of the corresponding full text which in turn was on average about words long are eective enough to support accurate retrieval in addition the subjects feedback from the questionnaire shown in the last three rows of the table indicate that the spreading based summaries were found to be ful eectiveness of fsd graphs we also performed an intrinsic evaluation of our marization approach by generating summaries from fsd graphs with and without spreading activation in this evaluation we used user judgements to assess rectly the quality of fsd graphs using spreading to nd commonalities and dierences between pairs of documents when fsd graphs is applied to raw graphs which are not reweighted by spreading the proach does not exploit at all the relational model of summarization we hypothesized that the spreading or extract subgraphs methods would result in more tinent summaries than with the raw graphs for this experiment pairs of articles on international events were selected from searches on the world wide web including articles from reuters associated press the washington post and the new york times topic tupac amaru associated press reuters rebels in peru hold hundreds of hostages inside japanese diplomatic residence peru rebels hold in

we will all die in here a guerrilla from the cuban inspired tupac amaru revolutionary movement mrta told a local radio station from within the embassy residence the rebels said they had to comrades in jail and said their highest priority was release of victor polay their leader who was imprisoned in they also called for a review of peru s judicial system and direct negotiations with the government beginning at dawn on wednesday coref coref same they are freeing us to show that they are not doing us any harm said one woman the attack was a major blow to fujimori s government which had claimed virtual victory in a year war on communist rebels belonging to the mrta and the larger and better known maoist shining path the mrta called tuesday s breaking the silence operation although the mrta gained support in its early days in the as a robin hood style movement that robbed the rich to give to the poor it lost public sympathy after turning increasingly to kidnapping bombing and drug activities guerilla conflicts in peru have cost at least lives and billion in damage to the country s infrastructure since figure texts of two related articles the top salient sentences containing common words have these common words in bold face likewise the top salient sentences containing unique words have these unique words in italics pairs were selected such that each member of a pair was closely related to the other but by no means tical the pairs were drawn from dierent geopolitical regions so that no pair was similar to another the articles we found by this method happened to be short ones on average less than two hundred words long a distinct topic was selected for each pair based on the common activators method summaries were then generated both with no spreading using only the raw tf idf weights of the words and with spreading three subjects were selected and each subject was presented with a series of web forms in each form the subject was shown a pair of articles along with a summary of their similarities and a summary of their dierences with respect to the pair topic each subject was asked to judge on a scale of bad to good how well the summaries pinpointed the similarities and dierences with respect to the topic each subject was rotated at random through all the forms and experimental tions so that each subject saw dierent forms and made decisions data points altogether as shown in table using spreading results in proved summaries over not using spreading for both commonalities and dierences it is interesting to note that the biggest improvement comes from the ences found using spreading this reects the fact that the spreading algorithm uses the topic to constrain and order the dierences found by contrast in a tf idf weighting scheme words which are globally unique are rewarded highest regardless of their link to the topic at hand conclusion we have described a new method for multi document summarization based on a graph representation for text the summarization exploits the results of cent progress in information extraction to represent salient units of text and their relationships by ing relations between units and the perspective from which the comparison is desired the summarizer can pinpoint similarities and dierences our approach is highly domain independent even though we have trated its power mainly for news articles currently the synthesis component is rudimentary relying on sentence extraction to exemplify similarities and ences in future work we expect to more fully exploit alpha links especially by more systematic extraction of semantic distance measures along with corpus based statistics from wordnet we also plan to exploit both text and thesaurus concepts to link extracts into stracts
