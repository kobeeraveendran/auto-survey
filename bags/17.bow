information overload problem nowadays document summarization plays an important role in information retrieval ir with a large volume of documents presenting the user with a summary of each document greatly facilitates the task of finding the desired documents text summarization is the process of automatically creating a compressed version of a given text that provides useful information to users and multi document summarization is to produce a summary delivering the majority of information content from a set of documents about an explicit or implicit main topic authors of the paper provide the following definition for a summary a summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts that conveys important information in the original and that is no longer than half of the original and usually significantly less than that text here is used rather loosely and can refer to speech multimedia documents hypertext the main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less space if all sentences in a text document were of equal importance producing a summary would not be very effective as any reduction in the size of a document would carry a proportional decrease in its in formativeness luckily information content in a document appears in bursts and one can therefore distinguish between more and less informative segments identifying the informative segments at the expense of the rest is the main challenge in summarization assumes a tripartite processing model distinguishing three stages source text interpretation to obtain a source representation source representation transformation to summary representation and summary representation a variety of document summarization methods have been developed recently the paper reviews research on automatic summarizing over the last decade this paper and reviews developments and seeks to assess the state of the art for this challenging natural language processing nlp task the review shows that some useful summarizing for various purposes can already be done but also not surprisingly that there is a huge amount more to do sentence based extractive summarization techniques are commonly used in automatic summarization to produce extractive extractive summarization are technique for sentence extraction and attempt to identify the set of sentences the overall understanding of a given document in paper proposed typically based on text generation salient notions that are most summaries important summary systems from the for for ijcsi international journal of computer science

yields a text relationship map trm from intra links which indicate that the linked texts are semantically related it proposes four strategies from the trm bushy path depth first path segmented bushy path augmented segmented bushy path in our study we focus on sentence based extractive summarization in this way we to express that the lexical cohesion structure of the text can be exploited to determine the importance of a sentence eliminate the ambiguity of the word has a significant impact on the inference sentence in this article we will show that the separation text into the inside

performance compared to state of the art summarization approaches the rest of this paper is organized as follows section introduces related works word sense disambiguation is presented in section clustering of the lexical chains is presented in section text segmentation base on the inner topics is presented in section the experiments and results are given in section finally conclusion presents in section related work generally speaking the methods can be either extractive summarization or abstractive summarization extractive summarization involves assigning salience scores to some units paragraphs of the document and the sentences with highest scores while extracting abstraction summarization usually needs information fusion sentence compression and reformulation sentence extraction summarization systems take as input a collection of sentences one or more documents and select some subset for output into a summary this is best treated as a sentence ranking problem which allows for varying length requirements most commonly such ranking approaches use some kind of similarity or centrality metric to rank sentences for inclusion in the summary see for example centroid based method is one of the most popular extractive summarization methods mead an implementation of the centroid based method for either single or multi document summarizing it is based on sentence extraction for each sentence in a cluster of related documents mead computes three features and uses a linear combination of the three to determine what sentences are most salient the three features used are to meet varying summary thresholds is centroid score position and overlap with first sentence which may happen to be the title of a document for single documents or given clusters it computes centroid topic characterizations using tf idf type data it ranks candidate summary sentences by combining sentence scores against centroid text position value and tf idf title lead overlap sentence selection is constrained by a summary length threshold and redundant new sentences avoided by checking cosine similarity against prior ones in the past extractive summarizers have been mostly based on scoring sentences in the source document in paper each document is considered as a sequence of sentences and the objective of extractive summarization is to label the sentences in the sequence with and where a label of indicates that a sentence is a summary sentence while denotes a non summary sentence to accomplish this task is applied conditional random field which is a state of art sequence labeling method paper proposed a novel extractive approach based on manifold ranking of sentences to query based multi document summarization the proposed approach first employs the manifold ranking process to compute the manifold ranking score for each sentence that denotes the biased information richness of the sentence and then uses greedy algorithm to penalize the sentences with highest overall scores which are deemed both informative and novel and highly biased to the given query the summarization techniques can be classified into two groups supervised techniques that rely on pre existing document summary pairs and unsupervised techniques based on properties and heuristics derived from the text supervised extractive summarization techniques treat the summarization task as a two class classification problem at the sentence level where the summary sentences are positive samples while the non summary sentences are negative samples after representing each sentence by a vector of features the classification function can be trained in two different manners one is in a discriminative way with well known algorithms such as support vector machine svm many unsupervised methods have been developed for document summarization by exploiting different features and relationships of the sentences see for example and the references therein on the other hand summarization task can also be categorized as either generic or query based a query based summary presents the information that is most relevant to the given queries and while a generic summary gives an overall sense of the document s content the qcs system query cluster and summarize performs the following tasks in response to a query retrieves relevant documents separates the retrieved documents into clusters by topic and creates a summary for each cluster qcs is a tool for document retrieval that presents results in a format so that a user can quickly identify a set of documents of interest in paper are developed a generic a query based and a hybrid summarizer each with ijcsi international journal of computer science issues vol issue no january issn online www c international journal of computer science issues all rights reserved differing amounts of document context the generic summarizer used a blend of discourse information and information obtained traditional surface level through analysis the query based summarizer used only term information and the hybrid summarizer used some discourse information along with query term information the article presents a multi document multi lingual theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion story flow word sense disambiguation for extracting lexical chains in a document all words and correct senses of these words should be known humans disambiguate words by the current context lexical chaining algorithms depend on an assumption and this assumption is that correct sense of words has stronger relations with other word senses using this assumption lexical chaining algorithms first try to disambiguate all word occurrences for sense disambiguation wsd is an immediate application of lexical chains and an extrinsic evaluation methodology reason word this generating and traversing the wordnet graph the algorithm presented in this paper is based on lexical chains therefore the system needs to deeply analyze the text per word has a sense based on it s position in the sentence for instance the word bank in the follow sentences has different bank of river and bank failures were a major disaster in first sentence bank means river s coast but in the second sentence it means economic bank the most appropriate sense must be chosen for the connectedness in a lexical chain in the algorithm presented in this paper word sense are calculated locally in this way the best word sense is extracted also use wordnet as an external source for disambiguation this word and increasing it cause fig diagram of algorithm s steps let wi be a word in the document and wi have n senses this procedure for finding the meaning of two words related locally together and placed in the same sentence we assume all of the possible meanings and senses of per word as the first level of the traversing word tree then we process every sense in a returning algorithm we connect all the relations for that sense as it s descendants and these descendants are generated through relations that are hypernym we do this process in a returning manner for n levels next every first level sense of the one word compare with all the first level senses of the other word the numbers of equalities are considered same in comparison is done for another word there is nt any equality for each word we choose first sense that is most common integer digit fig sample graph built on the words in the above figure we illustrate the relations of the tree root of the tree is considered as the target word and the first level nodes as the senses of the target words the nodes of the second levels are senses related with the first level nodes with hypernym relations this tree is generated using returning functions and traversing of the tree is in the returning manner function node t int level string sp for i to do sp if tnew create new call tnew end if end for fig algorithm for creation wordnet graph ijcsi international journal of computer science issues vol issue no january issn online www c international journal of computer science issues all rights reserved file is downloaded the above algorithm is one of the functions used for producing wordnet graph function is the part of the graph related with hypernym relation use the great encyclopedia of wikipedia because of the lack of special names in knowledge base of wordnet this is done using from that the g xml site we have created a for this file and then goal word abstract is extracted extracted abstract is used same of the glosses of another sentence s word we use creating the graph and traversing of it just for the first middle and last sentences and it is useful because these sentences usually encompass concise expression of the concept of the paragraph in most of the documents this manner we decrease the space of interpretation and therefore the time of calculation and the space of memory because we just need to keep some highlight sentences related with each other after clarifying the actual senses of the all words in the prominent sentences and with the similarities and relations between every pair of the words we put them in incessant lexical chains for example in the tree of two words and through the traversing of the first word we put these two words in the same lexical chain as soon as we reach the first common sense between the subordinate graph of the first word and the first level nodes of the second word each symbolizes that this word occur in lexical chain lci the first sentence and the third sense of this word is chosen as the best sense lexical chains created at first are generated from highlight sentences and we use different algorithm for putting other words of sentences in the relevant lexical chains in this algorithm with some changes in lesk algorithm we use gloss concepts to represent similarities and differences of two words let are two words in text we extract senses of per word in normal lesk algorithm from knowledge base then we find overlaps between gloss concepts and every two concepts that have more similarities are chosen as the target words moreover we use not only gram sequence of one word overlaps but also bi gram sequence of two words overlaps there is one of the senses the first word in gloss concepts of the second word we give one special score to this two senses we do this because two concepts may have common words that are not related with their similarities and it causes increasing in scores of that two senses and makes a mistake in choosing related word as a result considering the word sense in gloss concept of the second word s sense we can award an additional chance to this sense to be chosen in process of choosing words for chains from words that are not semantically related in fact gloss or gloss is an additional score and considering average existed words in sense s gloss concept and experimental tests we find that the best value for is it is important in surveying gloss concepts to survey just existed names and existed verbs at first there are lexical chains generated from highlight sentences with traversing the graph and with assuming lci as one of the lexical chains generated from last step and wj as one of the other sentence s words and with using the above algorithm wj is compared with members of lexical chain lci the similarity s score of wj with one of the members of lci is more than threshold t wj is added to lci and from now on other residual words are investigated based on their similarities with members of lci and wj too function wordingloss for to for to for to for to if s n elseif s n else break if end if end for end for if or wordingloss end if f h wordingloss ed new alledge end for end for fig compare algorithm for glosses clustring lexical chains after lexical chains are constructed for the text there will be some weak lexical chains formed of single word senses for each lexical chain lci a sentence occurrence vector vi is formed where n is the ijcsi international journal of computer science issues vol issue no january issn online www c international journal of computer science issues all rights reserved number of sentences in the document each is the number of lci members in the sentence if sentence k has members of lci then is two lexical chains lci and lcj go into the same cluster if their sentence occurrence vectors vi and vj are similar our clustering algorithm starts from an initial cluster distribution where each lexical chain is in its own cluster thus our clustering algorithm starts with n clusters where n is the number of lexical chains iteratively the most similar cluster pair is found and they are merged to form a single cluster clustering stops when the similarity between the most similar clusters is lower than a threshold value for this purpose we used the well known formula from linear algebra in the equation represents the euclidean length for the vector sequence extraction in our algorithm the text is segmented from the perspective of each lexical chain cluster finding the hot spots for each topic for each cluster connected sequences of sentences are extracted as segments sentences that are cohesively connected are usually talking about the same topic for each lexical chain cluster clj we form sequences separately for each sentence sk if sentence sk has a lexical chain member in clj a new sequence is started or the sentence is added to the sequence if there is no cluster member in sk then the sequence is ended by using this procedure text is segmented with respect to a cluster identifying topic concentration points figure is an example of text segmentation experiments and results in this section we conduct experiments to test our summarization method empirically datasets for evaluation the performance of our methods we used two document datasets and and corresponding word summaries generated for each of documents the and are an open benchmark datasets which contain and summary pairs from document understanding conference we use them because they are for generic single document extraction that we are interested in and they are well preprocessed these datasets and are clustered into and topics respectively in those document datasets stop words were removed using the du pub smart and the terms were stemmed using porter s scheme which is a commonly used algorithm for word stemming in english provided stop list in evaluation metrics there are many measures that can calculate the topical similarities between two summaries for evaluation the results we use two methods the first one is by precision p recall r and measure which are widely used in information retrieval for each document the manually the reference extracted sentences are considered as summary denoted by summref this approach compares the candidate summary denoted by summcand with the reference summary and computes the p r and measure values as shown in formula fig example of text segmentation each sequence is scored using the formula in equation where li is the number of sentences in the sequencei slci is the number of lexical chains that starts in sequencei plci is the number of lexical chains having a member in sequencei and f is the number of lexical chains in cluster score of the cluster is the average score of the lexical chains in the cluster our scoring function tries to model the connectedness of the segment using this cluster score the second measure we use the rouge toolkit for evaluation which was adopted by duc for automatically summarization evaluation it has been shown that rouge is very effective for measuring document summarization it measures summary quality by counting overlapping units such as the n gram word sequences and word pairs between reference summary the rouge n measure compares n grams of two summaries and counts the number of matches the measure is defined by formula the candidate summary and the ijcsi international journal of computer science issues vol issue no january issn online www c international journal of computer science issues all rights reserved rouge n where n stands for the length of the n gram countmatch gram is the maximum number of n grams co occurring in candidate summary and a set of reference summaries gram is the number of n grams in the reference summaries we use two of the rouge metrics in the experimental results unigram based and bigram based simulation strategy and parameters the parameters of our method are set as follows depth of tree that is created for any word extra value for lesk algorithm finally we would like to point out that algorithm was developed from scratch in platform on a pentium dual cpu ghz pc with kb cache and gb of main memory in windows xp environment performance evaluation and discussion we compared our method with four methods crf netsum manifold ranking and svm tables and show the results of all the methods in terms and measure metrics on and datasets respectively as shown in tables and on dataset the average values of and metrics of all the methods are better than on dataset as seen from tables and manifold ranking is the worst method in the tables and highlighted the best italic entries performing methods in terms of average evaluation metrics among the methods netsum crf svm and manifold ranking the best result shows netsum we use relative improvement for comparison compared with the best method netsum on dataset our method improves the performance by and in terms and respectively represent bold table average values of evaluation metrics for summarization methods dataset methods av av our method netsum crf svm manifold ranking av measure table average values of evaluation metrics for summarization methods dataset methods av av our method netsum crf svm manifold ranking av measure conclusion to select sentences to to add we have attacked single document summarization our that human algorithm is able summarizers prefer their summaries our algorithm relies on wordnet which is theoretically domain independent and also we have used wikipedia for some of the words that do not exist in the wordnet for summarization we aimed to use more cohesion clues than other lexical chain based summarization algorithms our results were competitive with other summarization algorithms and achieved good results using co occurrence of lexical chain members our algorithm tries to build the bond between subject terms and the object terms in the text with implicit segmentation we tried to take advantage of
