summarization ats has recently achieved impressive performance thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of large scale corpora to make the summarization results more faithful this paper presents an unsupervised approach that combines rhetorical structure theory deep neural model and domain knowledge concern for ats this architecture mainly contains three components domain knowledge base tion based on representation learning attentional encoder decoder model for rhetorical parsing and subroutine based model for text summarization domain knowledge can be eectively used for unsupervised rhetorical parsing thus rhetorical structure trees for each document can be derived in the unsupervised rhetorical parsing module the idea of translation was adopted to alleviate the problem of data scarcity the subroutine based summarization model purely depends on the derived rhetorical structure trees and can generate content balanced results to evaluate the summary results

proposed approach can obtain comparable performances compared with existing methods keywords automatic text summarization rhetorical structure theory domain knowledge base attentional encoder decoder natural language processing introduction automatic text summarization ats aims to produce a condensed representation while keeping the salient ements from one or a group of topic related documents which is a potential research area receiving considerable attentions from academia to industry with the amounts of data are being generated in the web age ats plays an creasingly important role in addressing the problem of how to acquire information and knowledge in a fast reliable and ecient way generally ats can be categorized into two types extractive summarization and abstractive counterpart extractive text summarization approaches directly extract salient words sentences or other granularities of texts to produce the summary conversely abstractive models paraphrase the salient contents using nlg techniques abstractive methods concerns the generation of new sentences new phrases while retaining the same meaning as the same source documents have which are more complex than extractive ones extractive approaches are now the mainstream ones according to the number of input documents ats can also be classied into single document summarization sds and multi document summarization mds methods in this paper we focus on extractive sds task the key to sds is how to score the salience of candidate text summary units i e sentences clauses ect there are lexical chain based approaches classical machine learning approaches graph based unsupervised methods with the recent advances in deep learning ats has beneted much from these new ideas and gained considerable improvements these approaches are described in more detail in section to make the results more faithful and coherent we incorporate discourse structures into summarization generation corresponding author email addresses com shengluan hou ac cn ruqian lu preprint submitted to elsevier october discourse structure theories involve understanding the part whole nature of textual documents the task of ical parsing for example involves understanding how two text spans are related to each other in the context as web mining extracts latent knowledge from the web content rhetorical parsing reveals the meaningful knowledge out of vast amounts of documents and help in improving many nlp applications the theoretical foundation is rhetorical structure theory rst which a comprehensive theory of discourse organization rst investigates how clauses sentences and even larger text spans connect together into a whole rst assumes that discourse is not merely a lection of random utterances but the discourse units connect to each other as a whole in a logical and topological way rst explains text coherence by postulating a hierarchical connected tree structure denote as rs tree for a given text in which every part has a role a function to play with respect to other parts in the text rst has been empirically proved useful for improving the performance of nlp tasks that need to combine meanings of larger text units such as single document summarization qa and chabot and text classication our proposed model can benet from rst for faithful results which mainly consists of three components main knowledge base construction based on representation learning attentional encoder decoder model for rhetorical parsing and subroutine based model for text summarization the rst component extracts domain keywords based on representation learning the domain keywords contain three types acting agents major inuence factors and dynamics of a domain the second component leverages the output of the rst component for rs tree construction which will be fed to the third component for summary generation our aim is chinese oriented text summarization to alleviate the problem of data scarcity we leverage the labeled english data rst dt and map texts of english and chinese into the same latent space from which the rhetorical relation between two chinese text spans can be determined furthermore the last component extracts summary texts from the derived rs trees the generated summary from our subroutine based text summarization model can be always balanced between nucleus and satellite subtrees the contributions of this work can be concluded as follows we rst proposed an unsupervised chinese oriented rhetorical parsing method existing rhetorical parsing methods are english oriented supervised methods that often trained on rst dt a human annotated discourse treebank of wsj articles under the framework of rst our proposed method leverages the idea of translation and embeds the chinese and english texts in the same latent space in this way the rhetorical relations between chinese text spans can be determined by the the rhetorical relations in rst dt domain knowledge was utilized in the rhetorical parsing procedure which was constructed based on tation learning domain knowledge was used in two aspects one for discourse segmentation and the other one for guiding rhetorical structure inference furthermore attention mechanism was adopted in rhetorical parsing thus the attention weights enable our model has the ability to focus on relevant and drown out irrelevant parts of the input dierent from the majority of literature our subroutine based summarization model is purely based on the generated rhetorical structure the basic processing unit is elementary discourse unit edu which is tive shorter than sentence thus the generated summary can be more informative this model is based on importance rst principle each time the currently most important edu from the rhetorical structure will be selected one by one mechanically the importance rst principle makes the selection of edus alternated between nucleus and satellite subtrees thus the generated summary can always be balanced we also proposed an unsupervised summarization evaluation metric this evaluation metric considers many aspects of how faithful a generated summary is to make this evaluation metric more eective the parameters were tuned by supervised learning on the golden standard of the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section reviews some related works including approaches about domain knowledge rhetorical parsing and automatic text summarization section is domain knowledge base construction based on representation learning the large scale chinese dataset and experimental results on it will also be given the unsupervised rhetorical parsing approach is elaborated in section in which the idea of translation and attention mechanism were adopted section is about the subroutine based text summarization an unsupervised summarization evaluation metric and experimental results are shown in section the paper is concluded with a brief summary and an outlook for further research in section related works in this section we briey review some related works in subsection we will rst discuss works about domain knowledge subsection then introduces rhetorical structure theory which is an important theoretical foundation of our work finally the latest and classical approaches of automatic text summarization will be described in tion domain knowledge knowledge is power domain knowledge plays a signicant role in many nlp tasks for instance the knowledge graph kg is a knowledge base proposed by google to enhance its search engine s results with information gathered from a variety of sources li and mao proposed an eective way of combing human knowledge and information from data for cnn to achieve better performance they presented k cnn a knowledge oriented cnn for causal relation extraction in k cnn the convolutional lters are automatically generated based on wordnet and framenet the data oriented channel is used to learn other important features of causal relation from the data lu et al studied the concepts of big knowledge big knowledge system and big knowledge engineering ten massiveness characteristics for big knowledge and big knowledge systems are dened and explored zheng explored how to enable humans to use big knowledge correctly and eectively in biomedical domain there are also some based text summarization methods we refer to domain knowledge keyword extraction is dened as the task that automatically identies a set of the terms that best describe the domain of documents generally domain keyword extraction approaches can be divided into two categories as unsupervised methods and supervised methods tf idf is one of the simplest unsupervised proaches the top k high tf idf value words are chosen as keywords until now tf idf remains a strong vised baseline textrank is another typical unsupervised method which formulates keyword extraction as recommendation the supervised methods often take keyword extraction as classication problems however a number of annotated dataset is needed which is limited for unlabeled data kong et al constructed a chinese sentiment lexicon using representation learning a skip gram model was built to predict word embeddings ing to the context words and their composing characters whose outputs were then fed into a random forest rf classier words of the same polarity were then grouped together to form the sentiment lexicon with regard to kg yago is automatically extracted from wikipedia and other sources contains million facts about million entities in which an article in wikipedia becomes an entity dbpedia extracts fact triples from dierent language versions of wikipedia to tackle the problem of low recall for pattern based approaches angeli et al leveraged dependency parsing tree for relation triple extraction they constructed a few patterns for canonically structured sentences and shift the focus to a classier which learns to extract self contained clauses from long sentences on the other hand the key idea of kg embedding is to embed components of a kg into continuous vector spaces and thus to simplify the manipulation while preserving the inherent structure of the kg typical methods contain transe transh kg embedding has been applied to and benets a wide variety of downstream nlp tasks such as kg completion question answering and so on rhetorical structure theory rhetorical structure theory is a comprehensive theory of text organization with more and more attentions on this theory rst has been applied to many high level nlp applications since marcu s earlier works on rst parsing and applications on text summarization rst is now one of the most popular theories for discourse analysis central to rst is rhetorical relation which exists between two neighboring text units the interpretation of how text spans are semantically related to each other described by rhetorical relations is crucial to retrieve important information from documents there are two types of rhetorical relations mononuclear relations and multi nuclear relations in the former ones one of the text spans is more important than the other one which play the role of nucleus and satellite respectively one the other hand all text spans are equally salient in multi nuclear relations which are all play the role of nucleus nucleus and satellite play dierent roles to the writer s purpose in general what nucleus of a rhetorical relation expresses is more essential than what satellite expresses the nucleus is comprehensible independent of the satellite but not vice versa according to rst the minimum processing unit is edu edu acts as a syntactic constituent that has independent semantics in this sense an edu corresponds to a clause or a simple sentence rst explains text coherence by postulating a hierarchical connected tree structure i e rs tree for a given text in the rs tree each leaf node corresponds to an edu each internal node corresponds to a larger text span which captures the rhetorical relation between its two children rhetorical parsing aims to generate edu sequences and rs trees for given documents it involves nding roles for every granularity of text spans and rhetorical relations that hold between them there are rule based methods traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods lethanh et al used syntactic information and cue phrases to segment sentences and integrated constraints about textual adjacency and textual organization to generate best rs trees toloski et al presented a syntactic rules and lexical rules based discourse segmenter slseg soricut and marcu s spade model used two probabilistic models for sentence level analysis one for segmentation and the other for rs tree building after that most research focused on svm based discourse analysis they regarded relation identication as classication problem joty et al rst used dynamic conditional random field dcrf for sentence level discourse analysis and then proposed a two stage rhetorical parser recent advances in deep learning led to further progress in rhetorical parsing dplp is a representation learning method whose main idea is to project lexical features into a latent space dplp constructs rs trees in a shift reduce way a multi class linear svm classier was learned to decide whether shift or reduce operation would be taken li et al s recursive method contains two components the rst is to obtain the distributed representation for sentences using recursive convolution based on its syntactic tree the second component contains two classiers one is used for determining whether two adjacent nodes should be merged if so the other one selects the appropriate rhetorical relation to the new merged subtree automatic text summarization automatic text summarization has spurred a surge of research and experimentation since its remarkable eect in modern web age with the fast development of deep learning technologies many eorts applied encoder decoder models into ats the usage of attention mechanism into text summarization was rst brought to prominence by rush et al this attentional encoder decoder abstractive model was trained on large scale dataset its variants and further improvements include al neural extractive methods are also popular such as pointer network based models summaarunner swap net most of the extractive models are trained on cnn dataset however large scale dataset is necessary for these neural models since they are purely driven for mds parallel data is scarce and costly to obtain to tackle this predicament lebano et al presented pg mmr an adaptation method from single to mds to generate abstract summaries from multiple documents this method is new but also aected by the data source and data scale besides the above deep learning based approaches there are also other solutions such as traditional machine learning based methods optimization based methods graph based ones ats was taken as an optimization lem in the ilp based method did exact inference under a maximum coverage model other traditional machine learning based methods take tf idf n gram the position and others as features to extract summary sentences for more details we refer to graph based methods have become increasingly prevalent and far reaching since their easy implementation and relative good performance such as textrank another representative of pervised algorithm is summcoder whose summary sentence selection module contains three metrics sentence content relevance is measured by a deep auto encoder network sentence novelty is measured by sentence similarity based on sentence embeddings and sentence position relevance is derived by a hand designed score function the authors of rst have long speculated that the nuclei in rs tree constitute an adequate summarization of the text it was rst validated by marcu louis et al proved that the structure features i e position in the global structure of the whole text of rs tree are the most useful feature to compute the salience of text spans hirao et al treated summary generation as a tree knapsack problem they transformed an rs tree into a based discourse tree dep dt which can be directly used to take tree trimming method for text summarization for mds to address redundancy problem zahri et al used rs trees for cluster based mds they utilized rhetorical relations that exist between two sentences to group similar sentences into multiple clusters to identify themes of common information from which candidate summary sentences were extracted in this paper we propose further contribution to this approach focusing on unsupervised extractive summarization ldc upenn edu com deepmind rc data domain knowledge base construction based on representation learning domain knowledge plays a signicant role in many nlp tasks at present most of the existing knowledge bases are in the form of knowledge graph such as yago dbpedia which generally consists of entity and relation triples the knowledge triples in a kg are composed of two entities along with their relation which are in the form of where and are entities that often nouns or noun phrases is the relation between and however knowledge keywords for a domain are also indispensable for a domain knowledge keywords can provide a panorama for this domain in this section we propose a framework of constructing domain knowledge base on the basis of representation learning our proposed domain knowledge contains three types of keywords acting agents major inuence factors and dynamics of a domain we dene the domain as denition domain a domain is a particular area of human knowledge such as education nance al for a domain keywords can be regarded as the knowledge generalization of the full text in a corresponding literature and help readers to quickly grasp the core idea core technique or core methodology in general two dierent domains have dierent knowledge keywords but maybe with some common knowledge keywords the denition of domain knowledge keyword is given in denition denition domain knowledge keyword dkk a domain knowledge keyword is a basic and characteristic ement of this domain which is represented by a word or phrase and is often referred to when talking about some aspects of this domain dkk can generalize the main topics of domain texts example teacher student professor teach learn library course doctoral are dkks of the domain education two dierent domains may share some of their dkks e library may be a dkk of some other domains but never share their whole sets of dkks the less the size of the shared dkks the more are the two domains dierent from each other we argue that besides nouns verbs and adjectives adverbs also serve as the key components in the above example teacher is a noun teach is a verb and doctoral is an adjective in fact these three types of keywords constitute the main types of dkks for each domain we construct domain knowledge from large scale texts the dkb in this work is composed of a set of triples containing domain keywords denition domain knowledge base dkb for a domain the dkb can be represented by a triple a p t where a denotes nouns and named entities each of which represents the acting agents of this domain p acts as the major inuence factors of this domain which are nouns t denotes the concepts about dynamics of this domain each of which is often adjective or adverb these three types of keywords constitute a full dkb for a domain our goal is to construct the dkb for each domain in a fast and ecient manner traditional methods can obtain high accuracy but with low recall it also need much eorts when used to a new domain on the other hand the more and more popular word embedding methods have the pros of robust and ecient it can be trained on large scale dataset without any other extra resource we leverage the representation learning from word embedding methods for dkb construction denition domain knowledge base construction dkbc given a large set of documents that consists of texts for several domains dt dkbc aims to extract a dkb from each domain texts i t the constructed dkb is in the form of specially for each domain di given the corresponding documents dkbc can automatically generate three types of dkks as dened in denition all generated dkks can constitute the dkb denote as dkbi in the form of such that if wm dkbi then wm dicti where dicti is the vocabulary taken from di suppose dkbi ai pi ti wp ai wq pi then p q to obtain better results our model is an integration of three dierent models the rst one is representation learning based model which we call vwrank the other two models are tf idf model and textrank model idf is an important indicator of the word s saliency textrank is an recommendation strategy for voting salient words the architecture of vwrank our dkbc model utilizes representation learning from word embedding approaches we use the improved word representation learning with sememes method called se wrl the sememe knowledge base they used is hownet se wrl provides dierent strategies among which se wrl sat achieved the best performance according to their original paper se wrl sat learns the original word embeddings for context words but sememe embeddings for target words for each domain we use se wrl sat to learn word representations then we dene the similarity between two n as consine distance candidate words n and s cw j cwi cw j obviously the following two properties hold s cw j s j cwi s cw j motivated by textrank the score of candidate keyword cwi can be computed as s d s j s j cwi cw js cwi cwks cw j s j cwk where is a damping factor which has the role of integrating into the model the probability of jumping from a given candidate word to another random candidate word s cwi and s cw j are two sets of candidate words that cwi and cw j similar with respectively the similarity between two candidate keywords is computed by after several iterations the s can converge to a xed value model integration besides vwrank in a domain we also calculate the tf idf and textrank values for candidate words in each domain we denote the high score candidate keywords of vwrank tf idf and textrank as cvw cti and ctr the nal score of a candidate keyword is computed as s cwi cwi cwi where and are harmonic coecients i is the indicator function such that cw if cw c else table excerpts of url and its corresponding domain url domain world xinhuanet com china com world sina com china soufun finance sports house table the statistics of documents in each domain domain sports it military olympic culture house domestic entertainment domain auto finance lady education society world docs avg sens avg words docs avg sens avg words health total then the nal dkks are composed of candidate keywords that further ltered by the value of the number of documents that cwi presents the number of all documents in this domain finally all selected dkks will be organized in hierarchies by their semantic in hownet dataset sogouca is a large scale chinese corpus which is crawled and provided by sogou labs from dozens of chinese news websites including news reports and reviews each document in sogouca contains elds of url docno contenttitle and content leveraging url information we can categorize documents into corresponding domains excerpts of url and its corresponding domain are shown in table after that we collected texts for domains we did preprocessing including delete empty or very short lines ignore extreme long lines the statistics of documents in each domain are listed in table from which we can see that most of the domains contain tens of thousands of documents unlike english to manipulate text at the word level word segmentation is needed for chinese text processing we used hanlp for chinese word segmentation part of speech tagging and named entity recognition ner which is a chinese natural language processing tool experimental results of dkbc we have nished the dkbc for domains according to the above methods the derived dkbs can be used for other nlp applications the statistics of dkb in each domain are shown in table fig shows some dkks of finance domain in chinese the dkks contains keywords such as these words can provide a panorama for domain finance sogou com labs resource ca php table the statistics of dkb in each domain domain sports it military olympic culture house domestic entertainment agents phenomenons tendencies domain agents phenomenons tendencies auto finance lady health education society world total fig the dkks of finance domain on the other hand in the domain of it fig some dkks are be these two examples can validate the eectiveness of our method unsupervised rhetorical parsing rhetorical structure theory was proposed as a way to attribute structure to text which often represents a text as a tree structure it is characterized by rhetorical relations which reect the semantic and functional judgments about the text spans they connect we rst give a formal denition of rhetorical structure tree denition rhetorical structure tree rhetorical structure tree rs tree is a tree representation of a document under the framework of rst the leaf nodes of a rs tree are edus each internal node is characterized by a rhetorical relation and corresponds to a contiguous text span the siblings are connected via a rhetorical relation such that in most cases one is nucleus and the other is satellite the siblings are both nucleus when they are connected by a multi nuclear relation in denition edu is the minimal textual unit of an rs tree which means that it ca nt be split into smaller text spans edu acts as a syntactic constituent that has independent semantics in this sense an edu functionally corresponds to a simple sentence or a clause in a complex sentence denition rhetorical parsing rhetorical parsing also called rst analysis rst parsing or rhetorical ysis is a procedure of generating edu sequences and deriving rs trees for given texts it involves segmenting discourse into edus and nding roles for every granularity of text spans edus sentences paragraphs and even larger spans and rhetorical relations that hold between them as depicted in denition rhetorical parsing contains two steps discourse segmentation and rs tree tion an example rs tree for a given chinese text is shown in fig the leaf nodes numbered with digits are four fig the dkks of it domain fig an example of rs tree edus the internal nodes corresponds to text spans are characterized by rhetorical relations such as joint and oration the arrow from a to b denotes a and b are satellite and nucleus respectively in the sense of that relation they are both nuclei when a and b have multi nuclear relation horizontal lines correspond to text spans and vertical lines identify text spans which are nuclei discourse segmentation based on domain knowledge base leveraging domain knowledge we segment each document in each domain into edu sequence according to denition edu functionally corresponds to a simple sentence or a clause we rst segment a text into paragraphs and further sentences by punctuations then dkb is used for segmenting sentences into edus concretely for a domain given its dkb kd and domain texts td for each text td i td algorithm is the detailed segmentation algorithm algorithm discourse segmentation for a domain text input a document td output edu sequences s edu i dkb kd segment td i into sentence sequence s by punctuations line break for segmenting into paragraphs period question mark for segmenting into sentences for each sentence s j in s do scan s j and match their words against the domain keywords in kd if the domain keywords of a clause have the form or then put it into s edu end for output the edus in s edu according to their order in the original text fig the architecture of rhetorical relation identication after algorithm each derived edu is a part of a sentence or clause characterizing the domain relatedness of its elements moreover most edus have the form of with respect to domain keywords for the form of we borrow a agent keyword from the nearest neighbor edu to form a complete triple after that each edu has a dkb triple a p t rhetorical structure theory discourse treebank for rs tree construction existing models contain classical machine learning based methods and deep based methods almost all of which are supervised methods these approaches were trained on rhetorical structure theory discourse treebank rst dt rst dt was developed as a human annotated discourse level corpus with rs trees for english written wall street journal texts these texts were manually annotated by the professional language analysts grounded in the framework of rst there are ne grained rhetorical relations that grouped into coarse grained relation categories in the existing approaches the latter categories are often used for training and testing since there exist multi nuclear relations non binary relations are often converted into a cascade of right branching binary relations for convenience in rst dt there are edus and text pairs that are characterized by rhetorical relations attentional encoder decoder model for rs tree construction the objective of rs tree construction is to nd rhetorical relations between two adjacent text edus then the rs tree can be constructed in a bottom up way for our chinese oriented rhetorical parsing work there is no human annotated chinese oriented discourse treebank like rst dt in english motivated by the basic ideas of recent progress in unsupervised machine translation we propose to leverage rst dt and embed chinese text spans and english text spans into the same latent space thus the rhetorical relation between two chinese text spans can be derived by the the rhetorical relations in rst dt our work is unsupervised since there s no labeled chinese dataset is used the architecture of rhetorical relation identication is shown in fig the unsupervised rhetorical parsing model we propose is composed of two encoders an decoder and two siers the translation encoder is responsible for encoding chinese and english texts into a latent space and the dkb encoder is used for representing domain keyword sequence the attention based decoder and attention based decoder are the same decoder with same parameters whose only dierence is the choice of lookup tables when applying them to dierent languages the two classiers are used for rhetorical relation identication in fig the components in dotted box are to constrain the model can map text pair from chinese english to english chinese suppose t t is english chinese text pair the output of attention based decoder is chinese english t t which then will be input to the translation encoder the output of based decoder is english chinese t t the object of this procedure is to learn a mapping such that translations are close in the same latent space the translation loss function is ltrans t t t t t t t t where is the sum of token level cross entropy losses the second objective of our model is to train two classiers when t t is english text pair we t t as its domain keyword sequence the concatenation of the two encoders hidden states is fed into two classiers the attention based span classier is used for determining whether t and t should be merged into a new subtree and if so the attention based relation classier is used to assign which relation and which role should be labeled to the merged node and its two children respectively the loss function used for classication is also cross entropy loss in this work we our propsed model is based on the sequence to sequence model with attention these two encoders are both bidirectional gru which returns a sequence of hidden states whereas the decoder is also an gru which takes as input the previous hidden state the current word and a context vector given by a weighted sum over the encoder states the nal loss function is l transltrans claslclas where trans and clas are hyper parameters lclas is classication loss for inference the input is chinese edu text pair along with their domain keywords and the output is whether they can be merged into a subtree if so which rhetorical relation and which role should be labeled to the merged node then the text of the merged node and its neighboring node s text will form the new input text pair loop this step until a rs tree for a document has been constructed subroutine based model for automatic text summarization in this section we present a subroutine based model for automatic text summarization which has been introduce in our previous paper dierent from the majority of literature our subroutine based summarization model is purely based on the generated rs tree from section the basic processing unit is edu which is relative shorter than sentence thus the generated summary can be more informative than summary that composed of sentences the summarization algorithm is based on importance rst principle each time the currently most important edu from rs tree will be selected one by one mechanically in this way we can obtain a hierarchy of dierent summarizations level wise from simple to complex by adding one more edu at each level there two ways of controlling the complexity of summarized result either by specifying the word length limit or the rate of text reduction when going to produce a summary the summarization model traverses the rs tree in a nucleus preference way that is a nucleus node is always preferred over its sibling satellite node if node a is preferred over node b then all child nodes of a are preferred over b the selection of edus should be alternated between the left and right subtrees of the root node whenever both subtrees are not empty whenever a leaf node edu is traversed the text unit represented by it will be put to the nal summary in our model a nucleus node is always preferred over its sibling satellite node thus the generated summaries will always content balanced all details of this subroutine based text summarization algorithm are claried in algorithm the and is the function with f and mean the nucleus resp satellite child nodes of f d p and s p are pointers pointing to the entry of subroutine d inding resp s inding zp is a formal parameter for storing a pointer for example after the subroutine call f it is zp in the subroutine body of d inding experimental results training details about unsupervised rhetorical parsing the training of our unsupervised rhetorical parsing was carried out on sogouca and rst dt datasets we used a mini batch stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithm together with adam with initial learning rate algorithm subroutine based text summarization input the rs tree of a document summary length cadence ratio r j k output the generated edu sequences redu if is a leaf node then put into redu and goto step else call f p subroutine d y

goto step else call index call zp y s p else if is non leaf node then call zp else put into redu call index call zp s p subroutine u y zp case w if j then goto step else call zp y s p case w if k then goto step else call zp s p subroutine s y zp case w if j then call s inding y s p if then j if k then goto step else call s inding y s p if has been travelled then call u y s p else if is a leaf node then put into redu call index call u y s p else call y s p case if k then call s inding y s p if then k if j then goto step else call s inding y s p if has been travelled then call u y s p else if is a leaf node then put into redu call index call u y s p else call d s p subroutine index if the word length of redu satises r then goto step sort the edus in redu according to their order in the original text return redu to train this model in each epoch the training data in each batch are the mixture of chinese and english text pairs we used textrank for dkbc of rst dt the size of word embedding for both language and gru hidden state dimensions are set to and respectively for two decoders texts are generated using greedy decoding unsupervised quantitative evaluation metric the commonly used evaluation metric for text summarization is rouge rouge evaluates n gram occurrences between summary pairs it works by comparing an automatically produced summary against a set of erence summaries the reference summaries are typically human produced which are expensive and time consuming it is even more dicult when facing large amounts of texts in the big data age there is no reference summary as golden standard in our selected dataset i e sogouca to build a quantization standard we propose an unsupervised evaluation metric we consider that a faithful summary should overlaps with title in three aspects gram domain knowledge keywords and named entities contains more domain knowledge keywords than other non summary texts contains more named entities than other non summary texts the similarities between two summary texts should be lower in case of redundancy formally for a document d in domain d whose title is t the faithful score of a generated summary s is computed as s w s s s where w rn is a scalar b denotes the rouge score between text a and b denotes the number of domain keywords named entities that a and b both have denotes the number of domain keywords named entities that has denotes the ber of edus in s to make the score more objective the hyper parameters w were learned using linear regression on dataset in the training step the faithful score for each golden standard is set to nlpir nist gov projects duc html table evaluation results on sogouca dataset approaches lead textrank ilp summcoder ours results and analysis for each generated rs tree we applied algorithm for summary generation in what follows we present the results using our method and our comparison to previous works since our model is unsupervised we compare it with existing unsupervised single document summarization methods the baselines include lead selects the leading sentences in the document until length limit to form a summary which is often used as an ocial baseline of duc textrank is a graph based text summarization model it represents the document as a graph in which sentences are nodes and the edges between two sentences are connected based on the similarity between them ilp is a text summarization technique which utilizes integer linear program ilp for inference under a mum coverage model summcoder is an unsupervised framework for extracting sentences based on deep auto encoders we generated four versions of summary word length and the rate of text table shows the faithful score of our method and baseline approaches our proposed framework outperforms many of the existing text summarizers on sogouca dataset in terms of our proposed faithful score such as ilp graph based approaches the nal summaries obtained from a sample sogouca document by each summarizer i e lead textrank ilp summcoder and ours with word length limit are shown in table from the summaries it can be observed that the result generated from our method is more informative than other methods our result can summarize the results of others the summary generated by ilp is similar to that generated by summcoder but it is dierent from those generated by textrank concluding remarks in this paper we proposed a novel unsupervised rhetorical parsing architecture for single document extractive summarization the proposed approach mainly contains three parts domain knowledge base construction oriented rhetorical parsing and level wise extractive summarization to the best of our knowledge this is the rst study to adopt translation idea for rhetorical parsing firstly we proposed a domain knowledge base construction model based on representation learning the learned dkb can provide a panorama for a domain which has two important roles for rhetorical parsing one is discourse segmentation and the other one is guiding rhetorical relation identication in the unsupervised rhetorical parsing model we leveraged the idea of translation and designed a novel attention based sequence to sequence model for rhetorical relation identication then the subroutine based ats model can accept dierent word length limit or summarization ratio and provide content balanced results based on rs tree to evaluate our generated summary results in an unsupervised way we presented a faithful score whose hyper parameters were learned on dataset directions for future work are many and varied one of challenges left for the future is to further improve the performance of rhetorical parsing such as introducing attribute grammar into the deep neural model another important further work would be to utilize rs tree for multi document summarization table case study with summary title airbus said it is seeking to participate in china s large
