introduction text summarization process automatically creating compressed sion given text provides useful information user oriented summaries focus user s need extract information related specied topic given explicitly form query hand generic summaries try cover possible information tent past years extensive experiments query oriented document summarization carried extractive summarization duces summaries choosing subset sentences original documents sentences ordered assembled according relevance erate summary contrasts abstractive summarization involves rephrasing information text human beings typically produce summaries abstractive way research extractive summarization fact tools needed construct semantic representations generate natural language reached mature stage today existing abstractive summarizers depend tive component example use language generation component multi document extractive summarizer produce nal summary paper focus query oriented multi document text summarization goal produce summary multiple documents specied topic increasing popularity news search engines displaying information practical pleasant way challenging important issue possible solution summarize multiple news propose short text instead raw aggregated headlines intuitively reasonable solution producing summaries large collection documents complicated task number documents
