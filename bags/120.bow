discovering conversational topics and emotions associated with demonetization tweets in india mitodru niyogi govt college of engineering ceramic technology kolkata west bengal email asim kumar pal management information systems indian institute of management calcutta kolkata email v o n l c s c v v i x r a abstract social media platforms contain great wealth of mation which provides us opportunities explore hidden patterns or unknown correlations and understand people s satisfaction with what they are discussing as one showcase in this paper we summarize the data set of twitter messages related to recent demonetization of all rs and rs notes in india and explore insights from twitter s data our proposed system automatically extracts the popular latent topics in conversations regarding demonetization discussed in twitter via the latent dirichlet allocation lda based topic model and also identies the correlated topics across different categories additionally it also discovers people s opinions expressed through their tweets related to the event under consideration via the emotion analyzer the system also employs an intuitive and informative ization to show the uncovered insight furthermore we use an evaluation measure normalized mutual information nmi to select the best lda models the obtained lda results show that the tool can be effectively used to extract discussion topics and summarize them for further manual analysis introduction analyzing news stories have been pivotal for nding out some of the quantitative and qualitative attributes from text documents a broad domain like news analytics incorporates the use of various text mining methods to analyze text it applies methods from natural language processing chine learning information retrieval in our study the qualitative attributes can be socio economic tags related to demonetization in india the sentiment score which generally reects the tone positive negative of the text as well as the emotions expressed can be one of the quantitative attributes in this paper we have dealt with two problems in the domain of news analytics rstly is text categorization without any prior domain knowledge topic modeling and secondly is emotion analysis for example we are trying to investigate how emotions of people relate to demonetization in india for text categorization we have clustered the news stories into several k topics unsupervised learning with automatic topic labeling topic modeling topic modeling reects the thematic structure of the collection of documents by treating data as observations which gets derived from a ative probabilistic process that comprises hidden variables for documents inferring them using posterior inference results the topics generation that describes its corpus the emotion analysis also referred as sentiment extraction would give an emotion association score to each story depending on the expressive tone of the story in basic emotions categories and two sentiments positive negative deciding the tone of the overall story introduction is here the roadmap of the paper is as follows data preparation and exploratory insights are described in section section is on background section reveals our proposed system architecture section deals with the experiment setup section gives the results section draws conclusions from discussions and points to future work data set ii data the data has been collected over a period of two months from november to december across four metro cities delhi kolkata mumbai and chennai based on sets of keywords corresponding to demonetization in india demonet black money cashless using twitter s streaming api and was stored into mongodb we approximately collected tweets in the order of retweet count during the period novel data comprise tion date and time user id user name tweets message and geographical area due to the huge volume of novel data we divide the data into only with dates user ids and text and conduct further operation and analysis based on the three variables most of the tweets are written in english but the original raw data set also includes the tweets in vernacular languages such as hindi or bengali we did exclude them in the initial data manipulation process the data from the nosql database was imported into r console using the tm package in cran library to construct the document term matrix for use in developing the topic model exploratory insight we explore the time series analysis of tweets over given time period we visualize the number of retweet by hour minute average number of words by hour we also explore which users have contributed to maximum tweets in our corpus it also determines user s inuence over others in terms of his retweet count out of tweets we see that most of the tweets are from twitter web client source followed by windows phone iphone sources we see that more than users have tweeted more than tweets for the event under consideration fig shows the hourly retweet count fig displays hourly average count of words in tweets fig shows the top source contributors platforms for generation of tweets fig lists the top twitter handlers with maximum tweets count fig and fig show some word clouds of the corpus fig top twitter handles with maximum tweets fig hourly retweet fig average number of words hourly fig wordcloud of corpus having high frequency words fig top sources contribution to maximum tweets fig wordcloud of corpus after removing set of keywords used to download data data preprocessing before applying any of the sentiment emotion extraction methods we perform data preprocessing data preprocessing allows to produce higher quality of text classication and reduce the computational complexity typical preprocessing procedure includes the following steps stemming and lemmatization stemming is a procedure of replacing words with their stems or roots the dimensionality of the bag of words representation is reduced when related words such as read reader and reading are mapped into one word read over stemming lowers precision and under stemming lowers recall the overall impact of stemming depends on the dataset and stemming algorithm the most popular stemming algorithm is porter stemmer stop words removal stop words are words which carry a connecting function in the sentence such as prepositions articles there is no denite list of stop words but some search machines are using some of the most common short function words such as the is at which and on these words can be removed from the text before classication since they have a high frequency of occurrence in the text but do not affect the nal sentiment of the sentence tf idf model term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf divides the term frequencies by the document frequencies number of documents were the jth word has appeared this adjustment is done in order to lower the weightage of those words which are common across all the documents the tf idf measure suggests how important the term is for the particular document in tf idf scheme words which are common across all documents will automatically get less importance preprocessing of tweet include following points remove all urls hash tags topic targets correct the spellings sequence of repeated characters is to be handled replace all the emoticons with their sentiment remove all punctuations symbols numbers remove stop words remove non english tweets iii background introduction to lda previously documents were treated as a bag of words approach as in many models which dealt with text documents topic modeling adopts that a document is a of topics instead of a bag of words representation and its sole purpose is to cluster each term in each document into a relevant topic a variations of different probabilistic topic models have been proposed and lda is considered to be a well known method alike other methods the input to lda is a term document matrix and the output of lda is composed of two distributions namely topic distribution and topic word distribution em and gibbs sampling algorithms were proposed to derive the distributions of and in this paper we use the gibbs sampling based lda in this approach one of the most signicant step is updating each topic assignments individually for each term in every documents according to the probabilities calculated using equation cw t cw t vk vk v p zi k wi v zi wi c dt dk c dt dk k where zi k represents that the ith term in a document is assigned to topic k wi v is the mapping of the observed term wi to the vth term in the corpus s vocabulary and zi signies all the assignments of topic except the ith term cw t is the frequency of occurrence of term v assigned to a particular topic k and cdt dk is the number of times that the document d contains the topic moreover k is the user input denoting the number of topics v represents the vocabularys size parameters for the document topic distribution and topic word distribution are denoted by and respectively by default and are set to k and we perform n iterations of gibbs sampling for every terms in the corpus and after this we estimate the document topic and topic word distributions respectively using equations and dk c dt c dt dk dk k vk cw t cw t vk vk v emotion analysis emotion classication is fundamentally a text classication problem traditional sentiment classication mainly classies documents as positive negative and neutral in this scenario the emotion is ne grained into basic emotions such as anger fear anticipation trust surprise sadness joy and disgust in this paper the nrc word emotion association lexicon corpus is selected as the labeled corpus it comprises a list of english words and their associations with plutchik s eight basic emotions and two sentiments negative and positive it involves three variables targetword egory and associationflag targetword is a word for which emotion associations are provided affectcategory is one of eight emotions or one of two polarities negative or positive associationflag has one of two possible values or indicates that the target word has no association with affect category whereas indicates an association fig shows the process to identify a crowd type from social media what are the topics discussed by people online to help us understand people s interests what are people s opinion on the specic topics to help us understand their satisfaction of those topics the term document matrix is created which is fed to lda based model for discovering latent topics and the documents are analyzed by the emotion analyzer then emotion analyzer will tag each tweet as happy sad angry fear surprise or neutral fig presents the architecture of our proposed system fig the process to identify a crowd type from social media via emotion analysis nmi in the experiment we used nmi normalized mutual formation to evaluate overall documents tweets cluster quality the following formula is used to calculate nmi n m y y where is mutual information between x and y where x xn and y yn xi is the set of text reviews in lda s topic i while yj is the set of text reviews with the label in our experiments a text review with the label j means that the text review has the highest probability of belonging to topic j n is the number of topics is y y log yy xx y in the formula means probability of being classied to topic i means probability of labeled to topic j while yj means probability of being classied to cluster i but actually labeled to cluster is entropy of x as calculated by the following formula log n the clustering result is totally different from the label if the value of nmi is and is identical if value of nmi is iv proposed system architecture we propose a system that consists of three main components including data collection data analysis and data visualization the data collection module is developed to crawl the tweets from twitter using data crawlers and to store the tweets into mongodb a nosql database for scalability and scheme less data storage purpose after data preprocessing steps such as tokenization stemming and stopwords removal the system mainly performs two different types of analyses to answer the following questions fig proposed system architecture experimental setup for the demonetization data we started with default rameters and input parameter topic number n which means desired topics by comparing the lda result given in table ii we choose topic number n as a basic group for further comparison since when n most topics have enough words to reveal information about the topic while without too much words to make the topics messy in the next step of our experiment we set n and tuning parameter and by setting while to see if the results show any difference we performed the emotion analysis using syuzhet cran package which is based on nrc emotion lexicon on the dataset as a result tweets were labeled with one of eight emotions anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust and two sentiments positive and negative to determine the overall tone of the event discovering topics vi results table i shows a list of topics the words are arranged in the order of highest probability of words distribution to topics fig displays some topics word cloud

crunch in banks as it lists cashless rbi crunch topic tells about encouraging online transactions as it lists easy online fig shows the distribution of top terms in collection of topics lda models nmi results the results show that with fewer topics the nmi value tends to be higher since nmi presents similarity of clustered tweets set and labelled tweets set the overall nmi results indicate that with fewer topics tweets set are more correctly clustered the reason for this phenomenon could be the length of each document tweet is much shorter if compared to traditional documents since the length for each tweet is limited usually no longer than characters information contained in a single tweet is also limited hence when the number of topics increases many topics tend to contain the same words as a result it is hard to determine to which topic a document be assigned in further experiments we can use different tweeter pooling schemes and see whether they affect the nmi results emotion count fig shows the distribution of emotions during this event as can be seen the dominating emotion is trust followed by anticipation and anger the reason might be that due to the mixed reactions of people expressing their thoughts and opinions through tweets more than tweets express trust as an emotion around tweets express anticipation tweets express fear with a count of around tweets of anger emotion around tweets are of disgust and tweets express sadness disgust emotion was the least emotion expressed in our study more than tweets express positive sentiment and around

media form text mining is an emergent technique for mining valuable information from the web cially related to social media our objective is to discovering tweets semantic patterns in users discussions and trend on social media about demonetization in india in order to detect conversations in connection to the event under consideration we applied latent dirichlet allocation based probabilistic system to discover latent topics we varied the lda parameters to nd a model whose output is more informative as evaluated by nmi performance of the lda models were not affected by changes in distribution parameters and at the same time the results signicantly changed with the change of topic numbers as we expected the quality of lda results also depends on the amount of records in the data manual analysis of the results revealed that lda is able to extract most of the detailed information from the data it extracts all the major event components including the people involved how the event unfolded however in some topics we ca nt infer to a specic label due to its mixed nature it is also important to note that all the extracted topics are related to the events covered by the collected data our method not only condes to the analysis of case study presented but also signicant to the analysis of twitter data collected in similar settings from our analysis we observed that the positive response has exceeded the negative aspects about the demonetization discussion as shown in the emotion distribution plot in fig which also does not rule out large section of people have raised voices against the event trust anticipation and anger are the top emotions in count which reects that our study is not biased towards one polarity understanding the inuence of social networks can help government agencies to better understand how such tion can be used not only in the dissemination of a economical event but can also help to draw responses that could help to
