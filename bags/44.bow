expensive human efforts hard expensive effort held researchers looking methods evaluate summaries automatically current automated methods compare fragments summary assessed reference summaries typically produced humans measuring fragments reference summary present generated summary method consider sentence fragment text unit evaluation process problem sentences contain individual pieces
