international journal of computer applications volume no may keyphrase based evaluation of automatic text summarization fatma elghannam electronics research institute cairo egypt tarek el shishtawy faculty of computers and information benha university benha egypt abstract the development of methods to deal with the informative contents of the text units in the matching process is a major challenge in automatic summary evaluation systems that use fixed n gram matching the limitation causes inaccurate matching between units in a peer and reference summaries the present study introduces a new keyphrase based summary evaluator kpeval for evaluating automatic summaries the kpeval relies on the keyphrases since they convey the most important concepts of a text in the evaluation process the keyphrases are used in their lemma form as the matching text unit the system was applied to evaluate different summaries of arabic multi document data set presented at the results showed that the new evaluation the known technique correlates well with evaluation systems rouge and kpeval strongest correlation with memog pearson and spearman correlation coefficient measures are respectively has the general terms automatic summary evaluation automatic summarization processing language extraction natural keyphrase computational linguistics information retrieval keywords evaluating automatic text summarization keyphrase based summary evaluation summarization keyphrase extraction arabic summary evaluation introduction evaluation of automatic text summarization systems using human evaluators requires expensive human efforts this hard expensive effort has held up researchers looking for methods to evaluate summaries automatically current automated methods compare fragments of the summary to be assessed against one or more reference summaries typically produced by humans measuring how much fragments in the reference summary is present in the generated summary one method is to consider the sentence as the fragment text unit in the evaluation process but the problem is those sentences contain many individual pieces of information which may not be used by humans for reference summaries choosing an appropriate fragment length and comparing it appropriately is a critical problem in the evaluation process the problem is to extract the matching units that express the informative contents of a text the misleading in choosing the informative content of a text leads to unfortunate matching between two pieces of text in a peer and reference summaries based on the intuition that the keyphrases represent the most important concepts of the text we propose a keyphrase based summary evaluator kpeval for evaluating document summarization systems considering the keyphrase as the matching text unit for the evaluation process keyphrase extractor kpeval idea is to count the matches between the peer summary and reference summaries for the essential parts of the summary text kpeval have three main modules lemma extractor module that breaks the text into words and extracts their lemma forms and the associated lexical and syntactic features that extracts important keyphrases in their lemma forms and iii the evaluator that scoring the summary based on counting the matched keyphrases occur between the peer summary and one or more reference summaries the remaining of this paper is organized as follows section reviews the previous works section the proposed keyphrase based summary evaluator section discusses the performance evaluation and section is the conclusion previous works evaluating summaries and automatic text summarization systems is not a straightforward process evaluation of automatic text summarization systems can be extrinsic or intrinsic evaluation methods in extrinsic evaluation the summary quality is judged on the basis of how helpful summaries are for a given task intrinsic evaluation has mainly focused on the informativeness and coherence of summaries this is often done by comparing the peer summary to reference human summary many systems have been developed for automatic evaluation of the summary systems bleu bilingual evaluation understudy is an gram precision based evaluator metric initially designed for the evaluation of machine translation the main idea of bleu is to measure the translation closeness between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations with a numerical metric they use a weighted average of variable length gram matches between system translations and a set of human reference translations lin al have applied the same idea of bleu to the evaluation of summaries they used automatically computed accumulative n gram matching scores between peer summaries and reference summaries as a performance indicator rouge stands for oriented understudy for gisting evaluation is a recall measure that counts the number of overlapping n gram units between the peer summary generated by computer and several reference summaries rouge has proved to be a successful algorithm several variants of the measure were introduced such as rouge n rouge s and rouge su rouge n is an n gram recall between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries rouge s is skip bigram occurrence statistics skip bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order allowing for arbitrary gaps rouge s measures the overlap ratio of skip bigrams between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries one potential problem for rouge s is that it does not give any credit to a candidate sentence if the sentence does not have any word pair co occurring with its references the problem is solved by extending rouge s with the addition of unigram as counting unit the extended version is called rouge su autosummeng memog memog is a summarization evaluation method that evaluates summaries by extracting and comparing graphs of character n grams between the generated and model summaries hovy al developed be method be is a very small syntactic unit of content they defined be as the head of a major syntactic constituent noun verb adjective or adverbial phrases expressed as a single item or ii a relation between a head be and a single dependent expressed as a triple head modifier relation their idea is to decompose reference and system summaries to lists of bes units and then compare the two lists to obtain a similarity score they include a syntactic parser to produce a parse tree and a set of cutting rules to extract just the valid bes from the tree a modified version of be is bewt e uses a set of transformations to match lexically different bes that convey similar semantic content keyphrase based summary evaluator a problem with methods using fixed n gram matching is that they rely only on surface level features and the nonexistence of deep features that express the informative contents of the matching units neglecting the linguistic features in the matching units misleads the matching process we define two major types of errors that can occur between the matched units in a peer and reference summaries under matching where non identical form units that cover the same concept are considered as unmatched units this problem can occur at any of the nlp levels lexical syntactic and semantic for example the units stages of education education stages education levels convey the same concepts but with different synonyms recognizing this problem needs different nlp analysis levels structure or syntactic over matching where the matched units does not reflect a real agreement in the concept between the peer summary and reference summary for example matching the word big that exists in two different phrases in peer and reference summary like big factories and big fish is unfair as there is no real concept agreement the most that keyphrases represent regarding this problem attention must be paid to the informative content in the matching units based on the intuition important concepts of the text in the proposed kpeval keyphrases are considered as the matching units for the evaluation process kpeval idea is to count the matches that occur between the peer summary and one or more reference summaries for the essential parts of the summary text keyphrases we adopted the existing lemma based keyphrase extractor lbake module which is based on statistical techniques in addition to linguistic knowledge to extract the candidate keyphrases kpeval technique starts by extracting the keyphrases for both the peer and reference summaries for a peer summary the number of matched keyphrases that occur with those existing in the reference summaries are counted precision recall and f measure are calculated to measure the peer summary performance features of the keyphrase based summary evaluator kpeval is based on counting the matched keyphrases that occur between the peer and reference summaries the important keyphrases are extracted based on statistical and linguistic features the existing lbake module is adopted for this purpose international journal of computer applications volume no may syntactic rules are used to identify the most informative phrases in a summary the matching process is applied to keyphrases represented in their lemma form so different word forms that have the same meaning in a peer and reference summaries can be considered the same this can be useful to overcome the lexical phase of the problem for example a word can have different plural forms in arabic so the lemma forms of the two phrases will be matched to the best of our knowledge none of the existing summary evaluation systems support an arabic lemmatizer hovy et al extracts the basic elements be which are used in the matching based on the words syntactic feature precision recall and f measure are used to evaluate the summary performance steps of the keyphrase based summary evaluator kpeval process has the following steps extract the indicative keyphrases at lemma level using lbake module for both of peer and reference human summaries count the matched keyphrases lemma forms that occur between the peer summary and each one of the reference summaries calculate precision recall and f measure to measure the peer summary performance keyphrase extraction the first step is to pass the peer and reference summaries to the keyphrase extractor lbake module to extract the indicative keyphrases at lemma level lbake is a supervised learning module for extracting keyphrases of single arabic document it is based on three main steps linguistic processing candidate phrase extraction and feature vector calculation it starts by breaking the text into words and extracting their lemma forms and the associated lexical and syntactic features using the arabic lemmatizer and then the extractor extracts the keyphrases in their lemma form for both of the peer and reference summaries the extractor is supplied with linguistic knowledge as well as statistical information all possible phrases of one two or three consecutive words that appear in a given document are generated as n gram terms these n gram words are accepted as a candidate keyphrases if they follow the following syntactic rules the candidate phrase can start only with some sort of nouns provided that not to be an adjective like general noun defined noun undefined noun copulative noun and noun the candidate phrase can end only with general noun place noun time noun augmented noun and adjective declined noun proper noun for three words phrase the second word is allowed only to be a preposition in addition to those cited in rule it is worthwhile to note that the rules applied are dependent and the given rules are applicable only to arabic language the importance of a keyphrase within a document is evaluated based on eight features number of words in each phrase frequency of the candidate phrase frequency of the most frequent single word in a candidate phrase location of document location of the candidate phrase within its sentence the phrase sentence within relative phrase length to its containing sentence assessment of the phrase sentence verb content assessment as to whether the phrase sentence is in the the form of a question weights of these features were learned during building the classifier the output of lbake is a set of keyphrases in their lemma form representing the input document the following example shows the generated keyphrases for two phrases a and b that exist in a peer and reference summary the high institutions in the the high towers in the villages after applying the filtering syntactic rules the system will produce the n gram keyphrases as illustrated in table table extracted keyphrases for the two phrases a a villages kp kp accordingly only one matched keyphrase lemma form village occurs between the two phrases we mentioned here that according to the previous syntactic rules units such as high high in the villages that occur on both of the two phrases are not extracted as keyphrases and consequently does not considered as an equivalent matched units note that the word sequence in the adjective phrase in arabic is different from the english the noun comes first then followed by the adjective on the other hand for an evaluation system that relies only on n gram matching the system would count as two extra matched units regardless the different tenor speech in the two phrases using such syntactic in extracting keyphrases contributes well in assigning the most informative units and at the same time reduces improper matching that can be occur in the evaluation process rules precision recall and f measure calculation kpeval technique is based on evaluating precision recall and f measure between the peer and reference summaries using the extracted keyphrases for a peer summary the number of overlapping keyphrases with each one of the reference summaries is calculated precision p recall r and f measure are then evaluated using the following formulas international journal of computer applications volume no may where is the number of keyphrases in their lemma form in the reference summaries and peer system summary respectively is the maximum number of keyphrases co occurring in a peer summaries summary reference and in is the number of reference summaries evaluation to evaluate the performance of the proposed system we compared it against other standard systems we apply kpeval to evaluate a set of different participating systems at tac multiling pilot and compare the evaluation results against the existing results of rouge and autosummeng memog evaluation scores data set the well known tac multiling pilot is used the package contains all the dataset files related to the multiling pilot the data includes the peer summaries human summaries and results of and autosummeng memog evaluation scores the data set available in languages including arabic we apply our test on the arabic documents for the arabic language there were seven participants peers in addition to the two baseline systems for a total of nine results the source texts contain ten collections of related newswire and newspaper articles each collection contains ten of related articles the multiling task requires the participant to generate a single summary for each collection the human summaries include three human reference summaries for each collection evaluation results table illustrates kpeval average evaluation scores for the set of summarization systems participated at tac compared our summary performance results against four other systems and autosummeng pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure agreement with the scores and the spearman coefficient to measure correlation with the rankings the results showed that kpeval correlates with the other four techniques memog has the strongest correlation with kpeval in both measures and as illustrated in table rouge table average scores by kpeval sysid kpeval shows the participating systems superiority ranking assessed by the different four evaluation techniques the experiment shows that kpeval has almost agreement with different evaluation techniques for assessing the participating systems superiority ranking table pearson and spearman correlation coefficient between kpeval and other systems r memog pearson spearman rouge memog kp eval participating summarization systems superiority ranking by different evaluation techniques conclusion and future work in this paper we introduced a keyphrase based evaluation system kpeval for assessing automatic summaries kpeval is based on counting the matched keyphrases lemma form of the summary to be assessed against reference summaries kpeval has three main steps i extract the keyphrases for both peer and reference summaries ii count the matched keyphrases occurring between the peer and each one of the reference summaries and calculate precision recall and f measure to measure the validity of the new system pearson and spearman correlation coefficient measures were tested between the results of kpeval against other evaluation systems rouge and memog using international journal of computer applications volume no may the four tac dataset the results showed that kpeval correlates with the strongest techniques memog has correlation with kpeval pearson and spearman measures are and respectively feature work includes testing the proposed technique for documents in other languages
