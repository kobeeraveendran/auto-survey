gauge models at high energy linear colliders are summarized abstract the phenomenology of models with extended gauge symmetries is particularly rich the existence of new gauge bosons is one of the hallmarks of extended troweak theories and their discovery would be a denitive signal for physics beyond the standard model sm however extra gauge bosons are not the sole signature of an extended gauge group these models also contain new exotic fermions which are required for anomaly cancellation as well as an enlarged higgs sector to facilitate the extended symmetry breaking in addition supersymmetry may also be present particularly in grand unied theories guts to solve the hierarchy problem and to ensure the consistency of coupling constant unication with present this talk will summarize the potential of high energy linear colliders to investigate the physics of new gauge bosons at mass scales both above and equal to the machine center of mass energy and to discover signals for exotic fermions the subjects of extended higgs sectors and supersymmetry will be left to other we begin with a brief review of several extended gauge models which presently appear in the literature the most appealing set of enlarged electroweak models are those which are based on guts examples being the unifying groups and in string inspired additional z bosons arise from the breaking chain where which is a linear combination of and remains unbroken tev the fermion couplings of the extra z boson z in this at low energies model take the form g q sin where lies in the cos sm research supported by the u s department of energy division of high energy physics q presented at the workshop on physics and experiments with linear colliders waikoloa tract hawaii april range cw cos w special cases in this category are model and arcsin derived directly from the ux breaking of superstring theories q are determined by group theory xw w and model model the latter case represents the model q leads to the intermediate symmetries e the rst chain leads to the additional z boson z discussed above while the ond chain yields right handed charged as well as neutral currents and is denoted as the left right symmetric model lrm in the lrm the z couples to g with is the fermion isospin and q is the fermion electric charge note that for strict left right symmetry another extended model based on the ond intermediate group above is the alternative left right symmetric model alrm which is embedded in guts and switches the quantum number assignments between some of the ordinary fermions and exotic fermions contained in the of in this case the right handed w carries lepton number and has odd r parity thus the usual constraints on the mass of right handed w gr gl there are of course many other models with extended electroweak sectors that are not based on guts in order to get a feel for the variety of such models we list a few of them here for example the sequential standard model ssm contains a z which is just a heavier version of the sm z while this model is lacking in theoretical motivation it does provide a useful benchmark in comparing experimental constraints and capabilities a recently revived based on the gauge symmetry provides interesting production mechanisms at ee colliders which will be discussed further in this report the un unied model where the extends the electroweak gauge group to quark and lepton generations transform under their own other models extend the color gauge group such as that of foot and hernandez which is based on there are several theories based on horizontal interactions model of bagneid et al in the generational model such as the sp each generation transforms under its own and in the leptophilic model dierences in lepton number are gauged new gauge bosons in all of the above models the z z mass matrix takes the form m m z z z m m z m where is determined within each model once the higgs sector is specied for example for and q cos sin where tan is the ratio sin of vacuum expectation values vevs of the two higgs doublets present in string models the physical eigenstates are then z sin z cos z cos z sin where is currently being probed at lep and tan from lep ref z m z with precision measurements extended gauge sectors by limiting the indirect contributions to processes such as low energy neutral currents atomic parity violation the w mass and the properties of the boson in fig from langacker and the the bounds on are presented as a function z mixing angle in models and for the case where mtop is of the z unconstrained the allowed regions are enclosed by the curves and the dotted curve represents the additional constraints imposed from the higgs sector as described in z mass matrix it should be noted that these limits the above discussion of the z are slightly sensitive to the eects of other possible indirect contributions such as the top quark higgs bosons supersymmetry and exotic fermions future improvements in these indirect bounds will be obtained as the data becomes ever more precise and the top quark is discovered z w direct searches for new gauge bosons at hadron colliders are performed via the and pp production mechanisms pp pt from the tevatron run with cdf has set a c l on the mass of gev in the ssm models and the lrm respectively using both e and data a limit has also been set on a possible new w with sm strength couplings of gev the recent run with approximately of integrated luminosity the very preliminary c l constraint of gev in the ssm from the cdf electron data alone existing and future bounds obtainable at the tevatron on new gauge bosons in models are shown in fig as a function of for various values of integrated luminosity these calculations assume e data samples with cdf detector eciencies and include a loop k factor as well as a nite top quark mass assuming we see that the tevatron will be probing masses of order gev in these models at the tevatron one may also search for new gauge bosons in the z w jets channel providing the large qcd background can be overcome the dijet invariant mass spectrum at the tevatron can additional bounds on the mass of new w bosons depending on their coupling strength but the lepton data is found to give the best constraints on most new neutral gauge bosons hadron supercolliders i e the ssc and lhc can search for bosons with masses up to tev depending on the model for example fig displays the discovery limit as a function of integrated luminosity for a from the lrm at the ssc solid curve and lhc dashed curve assuming a signal in the e channel only and at design tev we note luminosity the could detect a lrm with that in the search regions presented here it is assumed that the decays only into generations of sm fermions if a is discovered at a hadron collider a much more dicult puzzle develops the identication of the extended electroweak model from which the originates numerous studies of this issue have been performed during the last few years and have been summarized at this meeting by several ideas has been proposed including z w associated production leptonic forward backward and nal state tau polarization asymmetries body decays production with polarized beams and extracting a signature from the jet channel all of the techniques proposed thus far with the exception of the leptonic forward backward asymmetry suer from at least one of the following problems i the event rate dies o rapidly unless the mass is in the range tev and it is dicult to extract the signal from the overwhelming background lep ii and future colliders allow for indirect searches in the case s by looking for possible deviations from sm expectations for cross sections and f this is similar in concept asymmetries associated with the reaction to exploring modications of qed predictions due to the sm z at pep petra energies the limits obtained by this method are very model dependent and are quite sensitive to the integrated luminosity the value of s as well as the avor of f that the nal state fermion the measurable quantities associated with are sensitive to exchange are i total cross section f the ratio of hadronic to leptonic cross section had the forward backward asymmetry af f b iv nal state polarization asymmetry of taus a pol and if longitudinal polarized beams are available v the left right asymmetry af lr and vi the polarized forward backward asymmetry af f as an example of the power of this search technique fig presents the possible bounds on in models as a function of from a deviation in for c and nal states with of integrated luminosity at lep ii note that the discovery region extends to values of the mass that are s and is comparable to the future search reach of the tevatron a analysis has been performed in ref for a s gev linear collider where the above processes i and have been examined including loop qcd corrections oblique electroweak corrections identication eciencies of nal state particles and a beam polarization measurement error of p p figure displays the c l search limits from this study for a arising from models as a function of the or with or without beam polarization model parameter assuming p in general the discovery region reaches the results of a separate are shown in fig for a originating from a models as a function of cos where and lrm as a function of lr where lr is related to for various values of the center of mass energy here qcd electroweak corrections initial state radiation as well as nal state identication eciencies are included for the processes and v above while high energy colliders do have a large discovery reach for extra gauge bosons it is clear from these results that a s tev machine is needed in order s for l l to be competitive with the hadron supercolliders how well does an collider perform in determining the model of origin of a new neutral gauge boson in fig c from a distribution as a function of the model parameter is presented assuming a from model with tev is present in the data at s gev this analysis examines the processes i and above with an integrated luminosity of or and both polarized p and unpolarized beams the measured range of at c l corresponds to the points where the solid horizontal line intersects the parabolic curves a complimentary is shown in fig where the ability to discriminate between a from models and one from the lrm plane is examined here the unshaded areas represent the regions in the lr where the two models are distinguishable and the single hatched area corresponds to the region of confusion using the quantities above if one includes polarized beams and process v then the area of confusion is reduced to the double hatched region it is clear from these studies that machines are capable of determining the couplings of a relatively light tev the existence of new gauge bosons may also modify the reaction z mixing and hence w w which is notably sensitive to the specic form of the gauge couplings the w w participates in this process only through z can be used as a probe of the amount of mixing present i e the value of here we consider two observables the total cross section and the polarized left right metry the c l search reach at a tev collider with of integrated luminosity in models with s is shown in fig as a function of the z mixing angle is parameter for various values of tan recall that the z determined in models once the and boson masses and tan are known the relatively small search limits reect the fact that is tightly constrained by lep data and the regions where is the search limit disappears for example at with tan is due to the fact that close to these values of the ters the discovery window from measurements of the left right asymmetry is of course quite sensitive to the amount of beam polarization and its associated error the anticipated error in alr due to nite polarization is alr p nw p alrp p l w with w being the w identication eciency and where nw sents that the errors are added in quadrature the c l search reach from alr and combined is presented in fig for the lrm as a function of with p or and p p or we see that as soon as the uncertainty in the amount of polarization is included most of the sensitivity to exchange is lost w w may be more interesting in the case where the is on resonance which will be discussed below in principle new neutral gauge bosons will contribute to bhabha and moller scattering see e ref however in practice these processes are dominated by the pole and are not very sensitive to indirect contributions below production threshold tev mass range and clearly the discovery of a now we turn our attention to on resonance production at a tev collider we note that most of the discussion in the on the production and model identication of bosons at hadron supercolliders has focused on the tev at the ssc lhc which will presumably but not necessarily be built before a high energy linear accelerator would provide powerful motivation for building a tev machine the event rates are of course quite large on resonance yielding enhancements of orders of magnitude over the usual falling sm cross sections such a machine would become a factory in a manner similar to the production at lep i in this case unraveling the various couplings of the and determining its model of origin would become a much easier puzzle to solve the properties which can be measured accurately besides its mass include i the partial widths into all identiable nal states b t and had as well as perhaps exotics superpartners if these channels are available the total width tot which could also yield information universality should be veried as it is on possible invisible decay channels violated in some extended models several asymmetries can be determined for every identiable nal state for f b or t we have af f b af f lr ae a a pol i with the denition ai the forward backward asymmetry for the process is presented in fig as a function of the parameter at s tev the including the statistical errors calculated for values of a f b in the lrm with the ssm and the alrm are also shown for comparison we see from the gure that although this asymmetry can be well measured it alone can not uniquely dierentiate between the various models l some extended electroweak models possess specic properties that are unique to a new neutral gauge boson originating within that particular scenario for example in theories the fermion vector and axial vector coupling constants obey the relations v and a ab which yields the predictions while the property vu c t implies qcd corrections a f b f ab ab f b lr at f b at at f lr these relations are shown explicitly in fig where the forward backward try is presented for b and nal states as a function of in the case of the lrm the forward backward asymmetry for b and nal states as well as a lr vanish at xw the two distinct values of min forward backward asymmetry and left right asymmetry for b and nal states and the ratio b t are shown in fig c for the lrm as a function of these gures clearly display that the asymmetries do indeed vanish for these two values of the z mixing results presented here are essentially unmodied by small values of z and nite values of mt these distinctive properties make excellent on resonance tests of and left right symmetric models xw and q q b and b as a further example of the power of these on resonance tests we show the areas of the t f b planes that are populated by three dierent extended models in fig b respectively in each case the solid curve represents models as the parameter is varied the dotted curve corresponds to the lrm as is varied and the dashed curve is the un unied model as its model parameter sin which represents the relative amount of mixing between the and factors note that these three models cover quite distinct regions in these planes a as discussed above the decay z mixing as well as the higgs sector the total cross section for w w in the model with tev dashed curve contrasted to that of the sm solid curve as a function of s is shown in fig from ref for m mev clearly the existence of a greatly enhances the event rate for more details see w w can be a useful probe of z mz new fermions there is a wealth of phenomenology associated with exotic fermions that are present in extended gauge models particularly in the case of theories and in the case where mirror fermions are present so much research has been performed in this that it could well be the subject of a separate review here we will restrict ourselves to work which was presented at this meeting and related material in models each chiral generation of fermions is assigned to the sional representation which contains the usual of the sm fermions plus the right handed as well as new elds since the superstring inspired ories are supersymmetric the corresponding scalar superpartners to these fermions are also present for each family one then has the additional fermions n e l n e l hl hc l sc l where n e are color singlet vector like leptons with qn and qe h is and sc is a neutral color and a color triplet iso singlet fermion with qh iso singlet the most general superpotential allows for three possible baryon and lepton number assignments for h however all terms in the superpotential can not be simultaneously present or low energy baryon and lepton number violation will occur thus h is forced to be either a quark a diquark or a leptoquark a thorough background of these exotic fermions may be pair produced at colliders via s channel and exchange clean signatures are expected up to the kinematical limit n n has veried that this holds true for heavy neutrino production if the pair production of new fermions is observed then measurement of their forward backward and left right asymmetries can be used as a of their electroweak properties possible mixing between the exotic and ordinary sm fermions can induce single exotic via ee ee n e ne h d hd these processes are mediated through channel and exchange as well as t channel exchange in the case of e production and are directly proportional to the degree of ordinary exotic mixing present data this mixing to values mix this yields gev for ee or cross in the n e production with maximal mixing at a gev machine with the neutral cross section being larger than that for the charged leptons the cross sections without the t channel contribution i e single h production are somewhat smaller azuelos and have performed a monte carlo study and have considered several background sources for both neutral and charged single lepton production these authors found that the ratio of signal events to the square root of the background is greater then unity for mixing angles mix with mf gev for lepton single production at s gev and range for mf l leptoquarks appear naturally in theories which place quarks and leptons on equal footing including models as mentioned above they couple to a quark pair with an a priori unknown strength governed by the yukawa coupling for calculational purposes these yukawa couplings are usually parameterized by f em these particles can be light gev and still avoid with rapid proton decay and dangerously large avor changing neutral currents this is particularly true in models where each generation of fermions has its own which couples only within that generation present experimental on scalar leptoquarks are mlq gev at c l if eu from gg q q gev at c l where takes on values equivalent to the electroweak coupling strength from the production eq lq lq production at cdf and mlq lq at hera leptoquarks may also be pair produced and observed up to the kinematic limit in collisions for this case qcd as well as qed initial state radiation and beamstrahlung corrections have been recently computed and reported at this the angular distributions in leptoquark pair production are aected by the presence of the t channel quark exchange diagram and are hence sensitive to the yukawa coupling this can be seen explicitly in fig from blumlein and where it is clear that the angular distributions can be used to distinguish between scalar and vector leptoquark production as well as between the existence of and left handed couplings single occurs via the reaction e jet and is proportional to the value of the yukawa coupling cross sections at s gev for scalar leptoquarks using three dierent photon sources i williams distribution ii beamstrahlung and backscattered laser beam are displayed in fig from ref including a pt cut on the associated jet of gev figure shows the discovery from this mechanism demanding a signal for both and of integrated luminosity we see that with large values of the coupling strength discovery up to the kinematic limit is possible rendering this process competitive with the pair production process if leptoquarks are too heavy to be produced directly perhaps they can be in principle leptoquarks can participate in the detected through indirect eects reaction q q via and t channel exchanges due to the presence of the yukawa couplings and can produce deviations from the sm predictions for cross sections and asymmetries the c l bounds which can be obtained at a gev collider from such reactions is presented in fig in the leptoquark coupling strength mass plane for various values of integrated luminosity here the search region corresponds to the area above the curves and has been computed for scalar leptoquarks ee collisions an interesting reaction in ee collisions a possible option at the next linear collider is inverse neutrinoless double beta decay rst proposed by extended electroweak models with majorana neutrinos and heavy iso singlet neutral leptons can mediate l interactions at low energies such models can be probed indirectly by searching for rare processes such as neutrinoless double decay high energy ee collisions may provide a new window into the l sector of these models via the reaction ee i where the wi may represent either the sm wl boson or an additional charged gauge boson such as the right handed wr of the lrm in the case where two sm w l bosons are produced there is a danger of unitarity violation which can only be cured if either extra neutral elds plus mixing are included or a doubly charged higgs boson is exchanged in the s channel the cross section in the former case is presented in fig as a function of the heavy neutrino mass with s or gev from note that these results should be scaled by four powers of the light heavy neutrino mixing angle which is expected to be w w this l reaction is quite natural in the lrm as this model contains all the necessary ingredients for the preservation of unitarity heavy right handed neutrinos a doubly charged higgs scalar as well as right handed wr bosons in the lrm case the sum of the asymptotic and c contributions no longer cancel and a exchange is required in order to restore unitarity here d mn where n represents the heavy right handed neutrino and unitarity is maintained as long as n and have a mass less than tev generally the cross section for ee r can be quite large as is depicted in fig as a function of s r w w o c mass matrix does not signicantly contribute to w l w r in the absence of wl from maalampi et al in this gure the mass of the right handed wr is taken to be gev m gev and mn tev we see that the event rate can be sizable for integrated luminosities in the range mixing in the r production but can induce the mixed nal state w wr mixing this process will proceed via and u channel exchanges but still obeys unitarity due to the opposite helicity structures at the two vertices the cross section from for ee r is displayed in fig as a function of the mass of the heavy neutrino taking mwr gev and and s tev here the result must be multiplied by two powers of the scaled mixing angle we see that this cross section is reasonably small but might be observable depending on the value of the mixing l w r w w a second interesting possibility in ee collisions is dilepton production as has been emphasized by dileptons naturally appear in various tended electroweak models including guts and the model discussed in the introduction here dileptons contribute in s channel exchange ing a distinctive resonance peak as shown in fig from ref for a dilepton mass of gev conclusions in summary we see that extended gauge sectors yield an abundance of exciting phenomenology at high energy colliders the present bounds on additional gauge bosons are becoming stronger everyday with mass limits being in the several hundred gev range hadron supercolliders can discover bosons with masses up to several tev but will have more dicultly determining the extended model from which the originates colliders can indirectly probe the existence of new neutral gauge bosons up to l the possible discovery of a light tev at a hadron supercollider would provide an impetus for the construction of a tev linear collider as on resonance physics has an overwhelming potential in the case of exotic fermions there are many exciting production mechanisms and signatures which are unique to collisions and last but not least one should keep the ee collider
