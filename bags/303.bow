a m p e h o r t s a v v i x r a asteroid models from generalised projections essential facts for asteroid modellers and geometric inverse problem solvers mikko and josef university tampere finland institute faculty of mathematics and physics charles university prague czech republic e mail troja cuni cz may abstract we present a review of the problem of asteroid shape and spin reconstruction from generalised jections i e from lightcurves disk resolved images occultation silhouettes radar range doppler data and interferometry the aim of this text is to summarize all important mathematical facts and proofs related to this inverse problem to describe their implications to observers and modellers and to provide the reader with all relevant references introduction the title combines astronomy and mathematics in three ways while our application is asteroid elling generalised projections are the mathematical concept that denes the data we use and models from means that we are dealing with mathematical inverse problems make no mistake while the data are obtained by near automatic instruments and the analysis of the data can now be carried out largely by software tools made for this purpose it s not just machines some basic mathematical understanding of the problem is always required as well even if the calculations methods and principles are hidden in the software creating a model that ts the data is not the same as understanding and solving the inverse problem this is why we have written this brief history and review of asteroid models from inversion techniques that are demonstrably exact well founded and well established explaining the main points and leaving details to the references there are hundreds of papers related to this problem eld by now so one can easily lose track of the basic principles the main point is that this is a mathematical rather than merely computational problem this text concerns the shape and spin and some surface istics of asteroids mathematical modelling of the insides of asteroids from in situ radio data is a newer topic described in e pursiainen and kaasalainen by now the theory and practice of inverse problems of generalised projections gps is well tablished so asteroid modelling rests on a solid mathematical basis gps are in short integrals over parts of the surface of a three dimensional body that correspond to various types of observational data kaasalainen and lamberg they generalise the concept of a projection in a given direction houette to various forms such as photographic or radar images in instrumental sense quanta from the surface are integrated over time to form a quantitative reading what the integral of a gp looks like depends on the instrument here we discuss three classes of gps in three sections i lightcurves images and silhouettes and radar and interferometry lightcurves shape in its simplest form a gp is the apparent brightness of a body when illuminated from some direction and viewed from another the observable at dierent geometries as a function of time is called a lightcurve the corresponding gp integral is over the visible and illuminated part of the surface taking into account its light scattering properties if the brightness gp is known for several geometries can the shape of the body be inferred from these this is a fundamental mathematical problem or rather an inverse problem computing the brightness of a known surface is quite straightforward whereas the inverse direction is something else is there a unique answer even if yes what happens to the result if the data are noisy or sparse or we are not sure how the surface scatters light the rst step towards the solution of the inverse problem was given in russell for a modern version see kaasalainen et al if the viewing and illumination directions are the same the inverse problem does not have a unique answer about half of the information needed for reconstructing the shape is inevitably lost so there is no chance of a decent solution russell assumed geometric scattering i e brightness directly proportional to the area of the silhouette which is roughly the case for dark surfaces in kaasalainen et al it was shown that the same nonuniqueness applies to e diuse bright surfaces but in fact concerning the other half of the shape information since russell s geometry was assumed to be a good approximation of realistic asteroid observations the result stopped the study of the inverse problem for almost a century approximations by xed shapes such as ellipsoids were supposed to be the only thing one can get out of brightness data magnusson et al the inverse problem was shown to be uniquely solvable in kaasalainen and kaasalainen et al interestingly group theoretical tools employed in quantum mechanics turned out to be necessary for the proof the uniqueness requires separate viewing and illumination directions obviously the larger the separation phase angle the better the uniqueness proof requires an assumption of a convex surface to facilitate general analytical the scattering behaviour however is not especially restricted as long as the intrinsic darkness or albedo is uniform what is more the inverse problem is actually rather stable moderate errors in the data or the assumed scattering cause only moderate rather than drastic changes in the inferred shape this is called minkowski stability since the solution requires the solution of the minkowski problem that is very stable lamberg one version of the problem is if the areas of the facets of a convex polyhedron are known is the shape unique minkowski proved that it is and provably robust shape reconstruction procedures are described in e kaasalainen et al lamberg and lamberg and kaasalainen once the uniqueness was assured the next step was to see what happens with real data as is typical for many cases not all the methods used in the proof were directly suitable for actual inversion both convex and nonconvex shapes were used in numerical inversion in kaasalainen et al the former for the proven uniqueness and the latter for generality despite the ambiguities a robust practical procedure based on nonlinear optimisation to nd the rotational properties of the target and solving for the facet areas of a polyhedron representation and then applying the minkowski procedure is given in kaasalainen et al and available as software at database of asteroid models from inversion techniques damit durech et al indeed the convex version turned out to be minkowski stable in practice and even less than ten good lightcurves from at least a few dierent geometries provide enough data for a unique model in fact the explanatory level of convex inversion turned out to be too good in a sense it seems that practically all lightcurves of known asteroids can be explained well with convex shapes there are only few exceptions known out of over a thousand asteroids so while the fundamental nonuniqueness independent of the illumination phase angle and some uniqueness properties of convex solutions are proven in viikinkoski et al and kaasalainen troja mff cuni cz projects solution was reassuringly stable it turned out that there is a considerable limit to the detail one can infer from lightcurves the information limit was estimated in durech and kaasalainen even if there are quite large nonconvex features on the surface they usually have no unique signature for most realistic geometries the solar phase angle should be several tens of degrees of arc only near earth asteroids can be observed at such geometries before a convex shape can not explain the data thus in most cases nonconvex models simply can not be more than an artist s vision even though they look more realistic than a convex shape this is a pity since nonconvex inversion is actually easier technically than the convex one see the nonconvex methods and models in kaasalainen et al viikinkoski et al also available at damit the features of a nonconvex solution may look temptingly similar to those of probe visited targets but this is because the shape representation usually interpolates between surface points in a natural manner e by rendering a at region seen in a convex solution as a smooth valley this of course does not mean that the feature is based on any actual information if the convex model ts the data as well in mathematical sense the convex version of the inverse problem is not very ill posed the answer is unique and all that is needed to assure a stable solution is a positivity constraint and moderate isation to ensure a feasibility constraint computation and convergence are also very fast on the other hand the nonconvex version has inherent ambiguities viikinkoski et al kaasalainen quires regularisation for stability and usually can not be guaranteed in any sense to be correct in its features and details of course few asteroids are exactly convex so a convex solution inherently warns us of the same information limit in most cases we can only infer coarse global scale shape properties further corroboration is provided by ground truth the accurate shape models from space probe data asteroids such as eros gaspra and itokawa lightcurves computed from these models do not t the observed ones as well as those from convex inversion models this is essentially due to systematic errors in data and the scattering model that is never known accurately kaasalainen and durech in any case it emphasises the fundamental resolution limit of brightness data many of the concepts above can be conveniently examined in the simplistic two dimensional context ostro and connelly kaasalainen this is not useful for real world problems as such but the importance of the illumination phase angle and the essence of minkowski stability can be explained very compactly indeed a main point in interpreting brightness mostly due to the shape rather than albedo changes is not just that this is realistic as seen from probe images but that the solution is much more stable signicant albedo changes can be inferred from brightness data in which case this can be modelled as a spot in a d shape model e psyche viikinkoski et al such models are not unique for example one can always make a spot area sharper and brighter the opposite end more blunt and darker the existence and estimate of albedo variegation is deduced in the complete modelling process strong asymmetry of a single lightcurve may imply an albedo spot only if the data are from zero solar phase angle implications for observers solar phase angle a convex shape model can be uniquely reconstructed only if the viewing and in practice illumination geometries are not the same i e when the solar phase angle is not zero lightcurve inversion works well up to the distance of jupiter trojans with heliocentric distances of about au where the maximum phase angle is for more distant populations of small bodies observed from earth the solar phase angle is always too small to enable shape reconstruction from lightcurves for probing and sampling the shape solutions nonconvex codes are not practical since each code depends on its choice of shape representation support regularisation for smoothness and the corresponding setups see sect viikinkoski and kaasalainen viikinkoski et al there is no comprehensively coverable nonconvex shape class in the same sense that there is a convex class it is approximated by a collection of quite separate classes each class and setup chooses its solution relative vs absolute photometry for the purpose of shape reconstruction absolute photometry is always better than just relative lightcurves with unknown zero point however most lightcurve vations come in form of relative data this is no problem for the inversion scale factors for individual lightcurves shifts in magnitude scale are free nuisance parameters of the optimization the tage of relative lightcurves is that the shape uncertainty along the rotation axis is large an extreme example would be observation of straight line lightcurves in which case we can not tell how attened the spheroid is also with long period rotation when the full lightcurve can not be observed in a single night relative lightcurves provide poor information about the amplitude colours tained from the inversion as ratios between scale factors for lightcurves in dierent colours if we have calibrated observations in dierent colours the colour indices can be easily observation noise the random noise is not really an issue as long as it is not large very curate lightcurves can not give a more detailed model cf our photometric laboratory asteroid in kaasalainen et al with lightcurve accuracy of order the laboratory asteroid shows the ground truth and proves that a model with certainly wrong light scattering properties nevertheless is a good one minkowski stability and can t the data exactly so the accurate data do not increase resolution one should keep in mind that there is always a shape albedo ambiguity present so any attempts to reconstruct shape details are apart from other eects inevitably limited by the tion of light scattering properties being constant over the surface spin so far we have discussed the shape solution with asteroids one must simultaneously solve for the spin i e the period the pole ecliptic latitude and longitude precessing asteroids or time dependent ods are a straightforward extension of this kaasalainen kaasalainen et al so we only sider the majority class of xed spin targets many of these have orbits close to the earth s orbital plane that place them in the domain of the degree spin longitude ambiguity kaasalainen and lamberg it means that for geometry restricted to one plane the coordinates of the sun and earth in the asteroid frame are exactly the same for the original asteroid and such the is mirrored along its equatorial plane its pole longitude is and its initial rotation is in practice this aects the spin latitude and shape estimates as well but usually not very much this fundamental ambiguity concerns all data integrated over the whole surface regardless of the wavelength it applies to any process history or sequence of disk integrated data regardless of the orbital positions if it occurs at the planar geometry thus e thermal infrared can not resolve this ambiguity this is in fact the only nontrivial spin ambiguity for completeness let us prove that the spin solution is unique for non planar viewing geometries theorem for extensive geometry coverage there is only one shape and spin combination that matches the data assuming a non spheroidal shape and nonzero spin proof first we note that the planar ambiguity is the only condition of invariance of reproduced data with a simple transformation of the essentially invariant shape this is seen from the three rotation matrices corresponding to each spin angle kaasalainen and lamberg the sinusoidal elements of the matrices do not allow further simple mimicking transformations in the trivial case of zero spin a constant rotation phase matrix there is an innite variety of rotated but otherwise similar shapes that match the data in the uniqueness proof of shape we assumed innitely dense accurate and full coverage of vations since that is the only way of having an exact proof without haggling about the setup accuracy and number of observations those belong to the realm of stability not uniqueness which always assumes ideal conditions but with rotation the concept of ideal coverage is not so easily dened independent of the measurement setup let us rst assume that we have a system that records the brightness from all directions around the rotating target in an instant compared to the rotation rate the information from one instant is sucient to determine the shape separately then we need only one more instant to infer the spin properties assuming the instants are within one half of the rotation period since the shapes are the same up to a three dimensional rotation requiring three euler angles and one euler angle is the rotation around the target s axis we immediately get the unique pole direction from two euler gles and the period from the third rotation angle when we align the shapes to coincide or consider another case we have not determined the shape but the geometries have revealed a direction in which the lightcurve is at then it must necessarily be parallel to the rotation axis of course this is not very helpful in practice where the whole time series depends on the orbital geometries even if we have innite time in practice the spin information is strong since rotation is very constraining if we have lightcurves from a few geometries not close to each other the correct spin solution stands out from local minima in the goodness comparison the determination of the spin axis direction is also not aected by the shape albedo ambiguity the number of points is not that crucial if there are suciently many geometries successful version though obviously crude for shape can be carried out for very sparse photometry the strong constraints of the model make it possible to solve for the period spin and shape with sampling cies orders of magnitude lower than the usual nyquist criterion kaasalainen durech et al durech and hanus this is the most important modelling mode for asteroids since useful data can be obtained from hundreds of thousands of targets from large sky surveys much more than can ever be individually targeted if the brightness data are so scarce that no models of single targets can be made one can still infer statistically meaningful distributions of some spin and shape characteristics in large object populations the crude but analytical and provably unique model is based on the variation levels of extensive sets of brightness measurements nortunen et al kaasalainen and durech the underlying assumption is that such sets cover the required observing geometries widely and densely enough the approach is mathematically quite new potentially introducing a new class of inverse problems models can also be constructed from combined sets of data obtained at various wavelengths with thermal infrared and optical data this can be used to infer surface characteristics from thermal models delbo et al durech et al and other infrared lightcurves can safely be combined with optical data as the dierences between lightcurves at dierent wavelengths are small enough in view of the obtainable resolution durech et al implications for observers spin and period as mentioned above several lightcurves observed under suciently dierent tries are enough to uniquely reconstruct the shape and spin state what does it mean in practice for near earth asteroids that come close to earth the geometry usually changes a lot during the encounter so it is in principle possible to reconstruct the model from a single apparition for main belt asteroids we usually have to wait several years to collect data from at least two or three apparitions to cover the geometry another practical issue is the determination of the sidereal rotation period the local minima in the period parameter space are separated by about where p is the rotation period and t is the interval covered by observations kaasalainen so with any inversion algorithm we have to make sure that the global minimum is found otherwise the spin and shape solution may be wrong even if the dierence between the periods for local and global minimum is small with a gradient based approach this is done by starting the optimization at dense enough set of initial periods on the whole interval of possible values the range can be estimated by nding the synodic rotation period and its uncertainty fourier analysis with sparse in time photometry the sampling is sparse with respect to p and we do not have any initial estimate of the period then the interval has to cover all physically realistic values from the spin barrier limit of two hours up to hundreds or thousand hours pole ambiguity in reality the geometry is not strictly coplanar and data are not ideal so the shapes corresponding to and poles are not exactly mirrored versions of each other if such shapes are then used to t thermal infrared data one of them can t signicantly better that the other and this can lead to an incorrect conclusion that the ir data resolved the ambiguity however this might be just because shapes from lightcurves are slightly dierent and thermophysical modelling is sensitive to shape details hanus et al an example is asteroid bohlinia for which delbo and tanga showed that one pole solution is signicantly better than the other however given the low orbital inclination of only about this was caused just by random variations of the shape rather than by breaking the degeneracy also note that ambiguity has nothing to do with the prograde retrograde ambiguity in pole direction which is usually caused by insucient data light scattering model in theory the scattering properties of the surface can be reconstructed gether with the shape theorem in practice the scattering model is rather simple and often xed with relative lightcurves we do not have any information of how the brightness changes with solar phase angle as the phase angle is almost constant for individual lightcurves with absolute lightcurves or ibrated sparse photometry that cover a wide range of phase angles it is necessary to t also the phase curves this can be done either by using a physical light scattering model hapke or lumme bowell for example or a simpler mathematical model an exponential linear phase function multiplied by a combination of lomell seeliger and lambert scattering kaasalainen et al for example an advantage of this model is that it separates the phase dependent part and the other part that depends only on illumination and emission angles so with sparse data or absolute lightcurves all phase parameters are tted while with relative lightcurves the phase dependent part is held constant if the data do not cover low phase angles the exponential part can be set to zero and only the linear part is tted the phase angle behaviour is usually assumed to be the same for all data i e the coecients are the same independently on lter however due to the phase reddening eect accurate photometry can reveal dierences in phase curves for dierent colors and this requires separate parameters for dierent colours relative calibrated absolute photometry by absolute photometry we mean that the brightness is known in absolute ux units this is not needed in practice because without the knowledge about the asteroid size there is always size reectance ambiguity that can not be solved with optical data only so absolute photometry is needed only when optical photometry is combined with thermal infrared measurements and the model is scaled to real size with a realistic scattering model delbo et al durech et al for the purpose of lightcurve inversion calibrated photometry is sucient i e for a subset of lightcurves or data points we have information about their common zero point so they are internally calibrated if there are more subsets with dierent zero points they are arbitrarily shifted on magnitude scale an example are observations in dierent lters sparse in time data typically cover a wide interval of phase angles they have to be internally calibrated and the phase function coecients have to be tted with relative photometry only the shape of the lightcurve is know not its brightness with respect to other lightcurves so there is less information see sect nevertheless relative lightcurves are what we usually have to deal with yorp when talking about spin in sect we assumed that asteroid rotation could be described as rotation around a xed spin axis with a constant rotation rate however rotation state of asteroids is aected by solar radiation and anisotropic thermal radiation from the surface if the net torque does not cancel out when averaged over the surface rotation and orbit then it leads to a secular change of the rotation period and the spin axis direction an eect know as yarkovsky okeefe radzievskii paddack yorp eect the yorp induced change of rotation rate can be directly observed as a change of the rotation period lowry et al taylor et al or as a change of the rotation phase accumulated over long time kaasalainen et al the yorp eect can be easily included into the model as an additional parameter describing the linear change of the rotation frequency with time yorp also changes the direction of spin axis but these changes are so slow that they can not be detected from current data tumbling even without any external force the rotation of an asteroid can be more complicated than a relaxed rotation around a xed axis some asteroids are in force free precessing rotation state such rotation can be described by euler equations that determine the evolution of euler angles the rotation is fully described by eight parameters the angular momentum vector three components initial values of three euler angles and two principal moments of inertia normalized by the third one the size of the angular momentum and the initial nutation angle can be replaced by two other parameters the rotation and precession periods that can be estimated from fourier analysis of lightcurves kaasalainen pravec et al in practice reconstruction of the tumbling rotation state is more complicated than in case of principal axis rotation scanning of all physically possible combinations of parameters is time consuming so the best way how to proceed is to estimate candidate rotation and precession periods from the most prominent periods in the lightcurve signal scheirich et al pravec et al binaries binary and multiple systems are in general more interesting than single bodies see the view of margot et al for example but reconstructing their geometrical and dynamical parameters is much more complicated a general case can be very complex two similar size bodies orbiting each other on an eccentric orbit their rotation periods not synchronous with the orbital period the orbital plane may be precessing on longer time scales the spins may not be aligned with the normal to the orbital plane the most detailed model we have so far was reconstructed by ostro et al from radar observations of asteroid the system was later directly imaged by vlt we can not expect to reconstruct such details from lightcurves however mutual events that we observe in lightcurves can be tted with a simple model assuming ellipsoidal shapes of the components and geometry of the orbit can be reconstructed scheirich and pravec carry et al a special case is a fully synchronous system i e when two bodies orbit each other on a circular orbit and both rotation periods are the same as the orbital period for a distant observer such system behaves like a single body because the mutual orientation of the components does not change a slight modication of algorithms that can model nonconvex shapes enables us to model synchronous ries however the nonconvex ambiguity applies also here so we can not expect to reconstruct correct shapes from lightcurves only any disk resolved data would help of course so for example two stellar occultations by asteroid antiope revealed clear concavities durech et al sect master theorem taking into account all of the above we can for completeness write the full theorem of lightcurve inversion in all its glory it includes the solution of the shape spin and physically realistic scattering behaviour not explicitly stated previously eso org public news theorem extensive brightness data at nonzero solar phase angles uniquely determine the shape spin and scattering properties excluding albedo variegation of an asteroid when the shape is constrained as in kaasalainen et al and viikinkoski et al and scattering as in kaasalainen et al for a unique solution proof the uniqueness and stability proof for convex shapes is summarised in e kaasalainen and lamberg in viikinkoski et al and kaasalainen it was shown that with some assumptions a larger class of shapes than convex can be called reconstructable as suggested by numerical tests durech and kaasalainen kaasalainen and durech however it is certainly a smaller class than that of tangent covered bodies i e the shapes reconstructable from silhouettes of which convex bodies are a subset and the reconstruction is not stable in practice if a convex solution and a convex one t the data as well there are innitely many nonconvex shapes between the two that also t the data the spin solution is discussed above for scattering a general form of a scattering model is given in eq of kaasalainen and durech and its truncations such as eq are very close to typical scattering models such as lommel seeliger lambert or hapke the form is exactly the same as eq in kaasalainen et al which leads to a unique solution of the scattering cients via eq this is because the higher the order the resolution level of an unknown shape parameter is the more there are equations for it and this extra information can be used for a scattering solution remark the minkowski stability for the convex shape means that rather dierent scattering properties can account for the data with quite similar shapes thus the scattering solution is unstable so that one uses essentially xed scattering in inversion instabilities near nonuniqueness summary we conclude our review of the uniqueness and stability properties of the photometric inverse problem in inverse problems of by discussing some cases where minkowski stability does not help us tinuously parametrised systems ambiguities also translate to instabilities if there is a nonuniqueness under some conditions then there are unstable solutions under nearby conditions for example even the zero solar phase angle is actually sucient for a unique shape solution if the scattering is suitable kaasalainen et al the often used combination of lommel seeliger and lambert scattering is suitable in principle the l s part equivalent to geometric scattering at zero solar phase yields the shape coecients of even degree and the lambert part diuse scattering those of odd degree tering with a specularity exponent between one l s and two lambert would also yield all the cients but the solution is inevitably unstable because of the data and model noise any uncertainty of the brightnesses or the lambert component close to zero for dark bodies results in large uncertainty in the coecients of odd degree the lambert component is useful only at nonzero phase angles when its uncertainty is not a big issue but again the phase angle needs to be suciently large more than say ten degrees for us to be clear from the instability region around the nonuniqueness condition a further example of the same phenomenon is the case of nonconvexities close to strictly concave ones those without saddle like surface parts concavities no matter how large or how deep are never uniquely constructable from photometry alone kaasalainen et al viikinkoski et al the latter also contains further ambiguity instability examples so the reconstruction of any nonconvexities close to the nonuniqueness condition is unavoidably unstable in summary to obtain a fast global scale model of an asteroid from photometry one can solve for the spin and construct a convex shape with convexinv for further educated guesses one can struct photometry based nonconvex models with using both octantoid and subdivision surface troja mff cuni cz projects damit files tar gz com matvii adam representations see sect below if there are several dense lightcurves to warrant this a number of solutions obtained with various initial conditions are necessary then one should compare the results from the three shape representations to identify common large scale features viikinkoski et al such models are not rigorously dened and they are mostly governed by the representation type and the chosen regularisation functions but they may be useful for giving an impression of what the target might look like cf the nonconvex models in kaasalainen et al unless large solar phase angles are available durech and kaasalainen the convex solution is the only scientic one in the sense that it has well dened acceptance criteria and its approximate nature is well understood it is the simplest solution with the fewest assumptions sucient for explaining the data down to the noise level the acceptance of a more elaborate model can only be based on manifestly better data t requiring large phase angles or special assumptions limited to cases where the convex solution is not feasible even as an approximation e choosing a bi lobed shape instead of a convex option cf durech and kaasalainen otherwise such a model is not likely to be closer to the correct shape than the convex solution by any quantitative criteria see also the discussion at the end of the appendix of kaasalainen snapshot images occultations multidata the gp of adaptive optics ao images is essentially the photographic projection with instrumental point spread functions occultations basically provide samples of the silhouette of the target since ao processing typically causes some artefacts inside the image and in any case the strongest trast is along the contours of occlusion or shadows most of the information is in the boundary tours fetick et al in the same way as the inversion of the brightness gp data can be proven to be unique for convex bodies and conditionally to some nonconvex ones viikinkoski et al kaasalainen a class of nonconvex bodies can be proven to be reconstructable from image ary contours kaasalainen this class is larger than that of tangent covered bodies since most of the information is in the dark light boundary contours one can use these directly in shape reconstruction kaasalainen this also removes any modelling errors due to scattering from the image analysis on the other hand one can also use the images as such data or model errors in the images inside the contours are not very signicant as weighed against the contour pixels a robust way of doing this is to perform the t in the fourier transform domain rather than pixels viikinkoski and kaasalainen viikinkoski et al this makes gradient based optimisation and the control of the size of image features especially convenient often there are not enough images for complete reconstruction in such cases we can combine all the data from various instruments especially lightcurves with the images in the inversion process this is in principle straightforward the main question is the weight assigned to each data type finding the proper weights requires some experimenting and sampling a criterion for the optimal weights can be established by requiring that each mode contribute its essential information but not more to yield solutions as consistent with each data source as possible this is called the maximum compatibility estimate kaasalainen a procedure for combining all available data sources to produce asteroid models all data asteroid modelling adam is described in viikinkoski et al adam can be used for any data source separately including nonconvex models from lightcurves only but note the warnings above or combined with others several asteroid models have been constructed especially with ao data and lightcurves using ther adam the fourier transform mode or extracted boundary contours carry et al merline et al viikinkoski et al hanus et al a flyby images have also been combined with lightcurves in an analogous way to produce as constrained models as possible of the dark side combined with the exact cartography of the seen side keller et al sierks et al occultation data can be included in the inversion process as such or used as a consistency check durech et al with ever improving ao equipment the best images in the process are approaching cartographic resolution viikinkoski et al carry et al vernazza et al marsset et al almost carrying the problem away from the realm of inverse problems into cartography photoclinometry gaskell et al that have well established methods but with all ao images it is important to remember that a feature seen in an image can only be considered real and veried if it is seen in at least another image in a consistent manner otherwise it is only plausible or if inconsistent with other data nonexistent such spurious detail can be caused by the deconvolution or post processing of raw ao images the deconvolution of images is a separate inverse problem often practical for shape modelling and feature identication while not perfect it can be seen as further model independent regularisation that introduces useful prior constraints in addition to the point spread function into the full inverse problem another essential concept closely linked with shape class is the shape representation there simply is no universal way of representing shape models in inverse problems the choice always restricts the convergence and possible shape solutions in some way convex bodies are simple to describe by the positive curvature translatable to shape via the minkowski procedure whereas nonconvex shapes have various subclasses and thus representations these can be e starlike or radius displacements from given basic shapes or something specially made for a problem case kaasalainen et al ostro et al or generalised starlike octantoid or subdivision control points kaasalainen and viikinkoski viikinkoski and kaasalainen bartczak and dudzinski or level sets ideally at least two shape representations should be used in any given problem to establish the role of systematic shape eects viikinkoski et al an important issue in this context is also inverse crime kaipio and somersalo simulating data is necessary in testing an inversion method and the general uniqueness and stability of the problem or the information content available from a particular observational setup e nortunen et al in such cases one easily makes the mistake of creating the data with the same model they are inverted with which is called inverse crime this can result in much too overcondent solutions and ated resolution avoiding inverse crime is not just about not using the same discretisation level in data creation and analysis it applies to data noise that should include non gaussian elements surface tering that in addition to dierent forward and inverse problem models should include some random behaviour over the surface in data creation the surface representations and so on even with these cautions computer simulations in asteroid modelling are always likely to produce better results than in real life simply because nature is much more imaginative in producing variation in physical conditions and error sources than we are in spite of the speed and parallelisability of computers and clusters some numerical and tational aspects require consideration in optimisation procedures that only use the function value are slow and converge poorly genetic algorithms are a particularly poor variation of these for this problem and they are not well suited for general analysis as they typically lose the information on other eligible minima in this problem class local minima are usually sparse enough so that gradient based sation procedures in particular levenberg marquardt designed for chi square type problems such as these started from a variety of initial guesses are superior in both speed and accuracy moreover by exploring the whole parameter space we can be sure that the global minimum is not missed also the best eciency by far is obtained from analytical gradients readily available in this case in gration over model surface ray tracing is fast to carry out with some pre listing of occluding surface patches triangles kaasalainen et al many parts of the problem parallelise easily to e gpus viikinkoski et al one can also use game based image processing hardware but this may not be useful for obtaining the function gradients to this the data noise restricted observation geometries partly subjective choices in regularisation and systematic errors in both data and the model scattering and it becomes obvious that the whole thing is not solvable just by plugging some components together and letting the machine run obviously no single rendering of the solution is sucient in asteroid modelling from any sources the dierences between the rendering samples help to understand which parts of the solution are best constrained by the data on the other hand the usual sampling methods mcmc are slow and can not be employed because systematic and model errors dominate over noise and are not modellable in the usual mcmc fashion and because the chosen shape representation biases the results the only free shape space to sample would be a large set of mesh vertices each free to move around but this is extremely dicult to arrange in practice and even then one would need regularisation to keep the mesh from getting tangled after various experiments we have found the simplest way to sample is to compare the best solutions from dierent setups implications for observers adaptive optics although ao images taken with the vlt sphere instrument look almost like tographs taken by spacecraft hygiea in vernazza et al for example they are always product of deconvolution which can be source of inconsistencies and artefacts for example the deconvolved ages of vesta in fetick et al reveal amazing details on the surface at the diraction limit the limb was reconstructed with resolution better that the formal diraction limit but still there are artefacts on the disk near the limb in general the result of deconvolution depend on the method parameter setup and there is always a trade o between the level of details and presence of false artefacts occultations with a dramatic increase of accuracy of stellar catalogues due to gaia astrometry cultations by asteroids can be now predicted with higher accuracy the technical equipment is also improving so occultations will play an important role in shape modelling they are also the only way how to obtain information about shapes of trans neptunian objects that are too far to be reconstructable by lightcurve inversion opposition geometry and also unresolvable by ao stranger projections radar interferometry interferometry especially that from alma at thermal ir wavelengths is another high resolution data source of asteroids it is essentially the fourier transform of a thermal image so adam is readily usable for inversion viikinkoski et al for the available resolution level analogously to resolution ao images boundary contours provide most of the shape information the thermal modelling can be done fast by a semianalytical fourier series model nesvorny and vokrouhlicky radar is the main source of high resolution information from near earth asteroids benner et al its gp is somewhat strange in the sense that it projects surface points with a given radial velocity and distance from the radar onto one projection image point thus the image is a many to one mapping contrary to usual images which aects its information content while computational inversion of doppler radar data has been in use since the early as described in ostro et al the ness of the shape solution of the inverse problem was actually proved in viikinkoski and kaasalainen the proof was based on using the boundary contours of range doppler images that are even more pronounced in their information content than those of ao images and it was shown that the shape class reconstructable from these is that of tangent covered bodies other parts of the radar image vide further information and enlarge the reconstructable class in kaasalainen and lamberg it was shown that mere range radar data from a spherical target uniquely determine not only the tivity corresponding to albedo map on its surface but also the distribution of other radar scattering properties doppler radar data uniquely determine the reectivity radar is thus a provably rich source of information and it has the potential for very high resolution however it should be remembered that due to the inherent ambiguities of the range doppler plots as well as the modelling and data errors the actual resolution level of a radar based model is seldom as high as the nominal apparent resolution of the images this is well apparent from the ground truth probe images of itokawa and toutatis although the available radar observation geometries were somewhat limited or by the dierence of the features of the kleopatra radar model model with those of the ao one even though the models are qualitatively similar on the other hand the case of asteroid bennu essentially a convex shape covered by many small boulders and a large one shows that some detailed features including the large boulder on the southern hemisphere can be captured by a tailored radar model nolan et al there are various software packages for radar modelling radar data can be automatically included in adam input and adam is orders of magnitude faster than traditional radar codes in any case the addition of special features to the adam or any other basic model usually requires a hand crafted model within a model radar data are peculiar in that it is possible to have a sequence of high resolution radar images without being able to model and place the corresponding detail anywhere in a model with reasonable certainty with the ordinary photographic image projection details from even one resolution image can in principle always be added at least manually and tentatively to a low resolution shape model mostly based on other data such as lightcurves thus assessing the reliability of shape models from radar data especially at limited geometries is considerably more complicated than in the case of ordinary plane of sky projections
