l u j h h t a m v v i x r a from bosonic grand canonical ensembles to nonlinear gibbs measures nicolas rougerie abstract in a recent paper in collaboration with mathieu lewin and phan nam we showed that nonlinear gibbs measures based on gross pitaevskii like functionals could be derived from many body quantum mechanics in a limit this text summarizes these ndings it focuses on the simplest but most physically relevant case we could treat so far namely that of the defocusing cubic nls functional on a interval the measure obtained in the limit which lives over h has been previously shown to be invariant under the nls ow by bourgain contents invariant measures for the nls equation from many body quantum mechanics to nonlinear schrodinger theory derivation of ground states derivation of evolution equations positive temperature stationary states nonlinear gibbs measures and the nls ow a reminder on classical dynamics derivation of the nls gibbs measure on a unit interval grand canonical ensemble main theorem the variational formulation some tools of the proof quantum finetti measures berezin lieb inequality for the relative entropy references from many body quantum mechanics to nonlinear schrodinger theory the nonlinear schrodinger equation is a basic model of quantum optics and condensed matter physics whose analysis has motivated a huge mathematical literature the tion itself has been originally introduced as a phenomenological model and its derivation from the fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics is a major issue in theoretical and mathematical physics the advent of bose einstein condensates of ultracold dilute alkali vapors in the has given a renewed impetus to the eld the nls equation is nowadays thoroughly date july n rougerie studied as the basic eective model for the description of such objects the reason why a one body model such as nls theory can be used to describe a many body system is that in this context all particles reside in the same quantum state this is what is meant by bose einstein condensation an important line of research has been the rigorous derivation of the equation in a certain limit from the many body schrodinger equation for bosonic particles this section recalls some background on this topic the author apologizes for not attempting to do justice to the relevant literature in any exhaustive way the reader is refered to for a more complete introduction to the subject derivation of ground states the basic object one starts from is a many body schrodinger hamiltonian say of the form n hn j v xj wn xi here v is an external potential felt by the particles and wn a pair interaction potential that n s is most often taken radial this operator is considered as acting on the space of square integrable symmetric n bosonic wave functions that is of those n n satisfying n n n xn n rd of the particles under consideration for all permutation of the coordinates xn this symmetry requirement means that we consider bosonic particles which as the name indicates is mandatory to obtain a bose einstein condensate on a physical level this implies that we consider the atoms of the gas as the basic particles ignoring that they are themselves made of more fundamental objects this is however as fundamental as one can get for a reasonble description by ground state we mean the state of lowest possible energy i e the eigenfunction of the operator achieving the lowest eigenvalue or equivalently solving the minimization problem for the quadratic form under the constraint that n equilibrium conguration at zero temperature en n be normalized this gives the most stable n hn n i h an important question is the following is it true that at least in some well dened scaling limit the ground of the above hamiltonian resembles a bose einstein condensate the latter is a n wave function of the form n xn n in classical corresponding to putting all the particles in the same quantum state u mechanics this would correspond to assuming independent identically distributed particles i e molecular chaos boltzmann s stosszahlansatz if such an ansatz is valid one naturally obtains a nls like energy functional that u should minimize indeed inserting in we nd rd u v u en one usually expects the ansatz to be valid for large particle number n in order that the and two body terms in the above functional weigh the same in this limit so that one might hope for a well dened limit it is natural to assume that wn be of order n at least two possibilities to achieve this should be considered y z z n n for a xed potential w pick wn n w r kept xed or converging to a constant when n for some this situation is often called the limit it physically corresponds to having many weak collisions between the particles the limit functional one obtains is then e v u u rd y z z i e a nonlinear functional with non local nonlinearity often called hartree s functional z for a xed constant and a xed potential w pick wn n with as above this can be called a nls limit it allows to take the range of the potential as a parameter and to describe a situation where because of diluteness collisions can be rare but quite strong this happens when d since n n w rd w as measures it is natural to expect a true nls functional with local nonlinearity e rd z v u u rd z rd in the limit we refer to the literature in particular the previously mentioned reviews and also for results in this direction under fairly general assumptions one may obtain convergence of the energy per particle n e when n where is the bottom of the spectrum of hn and e the inmum under a unit mass constraint of the relevant limit functional this serves as a justication for the use of nls functionals to describe the ground states of large bosonic systems we warn the reader that for relatively large in the nls limit important new aspects emerge and an ansatz is no longer sucient see as well as and references therein the most prominent case where these important subtleties occur is when and the n rougerie so called gross pitaevskii limit then short range correlations in the ground state have the eect of replacing w by in where a is the scattering length of w one can also prove results on sequences of n minimizers showing that in a certain specic sense they are close to factorized states of the form let us stay vague on this point for the moment and simply warn the reader that in general the wave function n itself is not close to a condensate only its reduced density matrices are r derivation of evolution equations once one knows that ground states of large bosonic systems show bose einstein condensation the next natural question is wether this is preserved by the many body schrodinger dynamics indeed a typical experimental situation is as follows create a bose einstein condensate by cooling a bose gas to extremely low temperatures so that one may assume that the ground state is reached the n are then in a stationary state of the hamiltonian hn which is approximately a factorized state un to probe the dynamics one may then perturb the system most often by changing the one body potential v in and observe the subsequent evolution this asks the question of the dynamics of approximately factorized states under the quantum evolution associated to hamiltonians of the form consider the cauchy problem itn hn n n un usually this where we stay voluntarily vague on the precise meaning of the symbol means convergence of reduced density matrices the typical result one obtains for ground states is it true that the solution n t stays approximately factorized n t xn xj n after some time evolution in limits similar to those previously mentioned this has been proved by a variety of authors inserting the ansatz in one sees that the relevant solves a nonlinear equation hartree s equation in the case of a limit a nls equation itu u v u u itu u v u rd w u in the case of a nls or gross pitaevskii limit in the latter case by scattering length of w rd w should be replaced r many results in this direction have been proved over the years see the reviews and for example the by far non exhaustive following list of original references positive temperature stationary states the results quickly summarized in the previous subsections already put the nls theory on a rm rigorous ground as far as the description of bose einstein condensates at low temperature is concerned but it would be highly desirable to know something about not only ground states as in subsection but also positive temperature states indeed in experiments the temperature is always extremely low but nite the bose einstein condensation phenomenon in fact refers to the existence of a critical temperature below which the positive temperature equilibrium states of a bose gas show condensation in the sense that all particles reside in the ground state of nls functionals as previously dened a satisfactory mathematically rigorous estimate of the critical temperature is still missing a closely related question is that of the description of stationary positive temperature states in the absence of bose einstein condensation can the nls description still be relevant in a well dened limit for such objects the canonical equilibrium state for the hamiltonian hn at temperature t is the gibbs state n t exp hn zn t t where the partition function zn t xes the trace to be a trace class operator on can such states or close variants converge to nls related objects in some limit what would the natural limiting objects be these questions are the subject of the paper that we summarize in this text here we shall rst try to answer the second question since many body gibbs states are stationary under the many body schrodinger ow one should expect that the natural limit objects are invariant under the nls ow nonlinear gibbs measures and the nls flow nonlinear gibbs measures have recently become a useful tool to construct solutions to time dependent nonlinear schrodinger equations with rough initial data see for instance these are probability measures which are formally dened by z e where u is a nls like functional as discussed above the rigorous construction of these measures is an important part of the euclidean approach to constructive quantum field theory cqft the recent progress on the pde side has mainly been to dene the nls ow almost surely on the support of the measures which typically live over rather rough functional spaces and to prove the invariance of the measures along the associated nls ow these objects have an obvious formal resemblance with gibbs states such as and it is the main goal of the paper to explore this connection in more details for the moment we can treat only the defocusing case based on taking and w in or this is due to well known diculties with the denition of the measures in other cases for this reason the rest of the discussion will be mainly limited to the case although we have partial results in a more general and abstract setting for which we refer to the original paper n rougerie a reminder on classical dynamics consider the evolution of a single classical particle the dynamics is given by a hamilton function p rd r on the phase space of all possible positions and velocities the hamilton equation for the dynamics of the particle is rd dene the associated gibbs measures at temperature t p exp t p dxdp where z is a normalization factor ensuring x p p p z p z z these measures are of course invariant under the ow because the latter conserves the energy p and leaves the lebesgue measure invariant liouville s theorem one should note that the gibbs measures are not any invariant measure in that they have a physically very natural variational characterization namely they minimize the free energy functional p t log dxdp z z rdrd z z amongst probability measures which means that they achieve a balance between minimizing the energy and maximizing the entropy again by formal analogy between and this time the measures are good candidates to play a similar role in the nls theory where the dynamics is at least formally also hamiltonian invariant measures for the nls equation let us now recall the rigorous tion of the gibbs measure based on the functionals or the way to proceed is by rst dening the free non interacting measure case formally exp u du z rd then one denes the interacting measure as being absolutely continuous where with respect to for a given function w or even for w set exp zr z z y where the number zr relative partition function ensures that this is a probability measure in we have considered only cases where this construction makes sense without any need for renormalization the free measure the free measure is a gaussian measure over an innite dimensional hilbert space it is dened by the following classical construction take h a self adjoint operator on some hilbert space h with compact resolvent for the applications in this note we shall take on r or r with either dirichlet neumann or periodic boundary conditions the on space on which these operators act will always be denoted h we require that r is such that these operators are positive denite in the latter two cases one must m pick m to ensure this we shall restrict to a for reasons that we will explain later and include the case as a formal limit a we write the spectral of h a m m ujih uj and dene the asociated scale of sobolev like spaces hs u uj u hs s one can then dene a nite dimensional measure on uk by setting dk u j exp k u u uj i h where dajdbj and aj bj are the real and imaginary part of the scalar product u uj i h a general tightness argument for this sequence of measures allows to see that they are all cylindrical projections of a common measure living on some hs where generically s lemma free gibbs measures assume that there exists p such that trh hp j then there exists a unique measure over the space such that for all k the above nite dimensional measure is the cylindrical projection of on uk moreover uk k ih where this is seen as an operator acting on some comments denotes the orthogonal projector onto v h k s h n n rougerie in the cases with anharmonic potentials that are our main example one can pick so that the measure lives on the original hilbert space in general this is not the case and this is the main reason why we have so far been able to derive the nls gibbs measures only in formally holds one can check that in the case of a nite interval a for any p the measure thus lives over h the usual based sobolev space for any more generally for a laplacian on a bounded set in d dimensions the measure lives over h for all we thus see that already in one has to consider measures over negative sobolev spaces one might be surprised that the measure lives over a space where the energy ciated with the hamiltonian h is innite this is however a basic fact in the theory of gaussian measures formula indicates that although the measure itself may live over rough spaces certain averages related to it are in fact nice compact operators over the original hilbert space in the cases of interest to this note the right hand side of will actually always be trace class the interacting measure we can now use the previous lemma to dene the interacting measure we have to check that z z y makes sense almost surely and satises some integrability properties w t we only need that the relative partition function zr makes sense and is strictly positive but in the simple case under consideration we will have much stronger properties lemma interacting gibbs measure consider the case where h is either or let p be the number in and the free measure dened in lemma assume that w where is a positive radon measure and a positive bounded function the function u is in in particular makes sense as a probability measure over exp zr the proof consists of essentially two remarks since we work with a positive w it is sucient to check integrability properties for itself to obtain zr this makes computations easier that is integrable follows easily from identifying w with the cation operator by y on the two body hilbert space we have z tr w ih z tr w where the trace is taken over the symmetric subspace the expression in the hand side can be shown to be nite by direct estimates on the green function when w is just a bounded function one can directly use the fact that is class invariance under the nls ow for the particular case bourgain proved that the nls ow is well dened surely and that the measure is invariant under the he also considered higher order non linearities as well as the focusing case still in the harmonic oscillator case a in not covered by our approach has been dealt with by burq thomann tzvetkov here also one gets existence of the ow s and invariance of the measure these measures thus play a special role in the theory of the nls ow they give a whole set of low regularity initial data for which the ow makes sense and they are a natural invariant for the dynamics since the nls equation arises as the limit of body quantum mechanics it is very natural to wonder wether these objects can be related to equilibrium states of some many body schrodinger hamiltonian we explain that this is indeed the case in the next section derivation of the nls gibbs measure on a unit interval in this section we turn to describing the new results proved in for simplicity we shall not present the full abstract setting but only those results that are relevant for the models based on and for which holds with p and lemma holds it is in fact possible to relax these assumptions and obtain a measure which lives over negative regularity spaces whose density matrices are not trace class but only belong to a higher schatten space in this case the interaction operator w must be very regular and can not be of the form y one should think of it as a regularization of a physical interaction the many body object that gives rise to the nonlinear gibbs measure is in fact the canonical ensemble for bosonic particles the limit we consider is a large temperature eld limit we shall not try to discuss the physical relevance of this limit here the main goal is to connect nonlinear gibbs measures to many body equilibrium states in view of the results recalled in section it is then very natural to expect the former to be invariant under the nls ow grand canonical ensemble the grand canonical gibbs states live over a hilbert space where the particle number is not xed but seen as a random variable namely we work in the bosonic fock space made of all possible superpositions of states with any number of particles f r and h everywhere in the sequel we use the notation h c c hn f where hk h s o sensu he worked under periodic boundary conditions only is refered to as the trace class case in n rougerie for the k particles bosonic hilbert space in this context the particle number is an operator acting on each n particle sector separately and equal to on the n particle sector the mixed states over this hilbert space are as usual the self adjoint positive trace class operators on identied with the corresponding orthogonal projectors for any operator a on we call its expectation value in the state the quantity with trace the pure states are the vectors of f f f whenever this has a meaning in particular the expected or average particle number is n n i trf a h trf n we consider the second quantized hamiltonian acting on which is the natural extension of n n w m m h w m hj hn f j a m xj m m here h is taken as in or which we include as the formal a case the interaction potential w is chosen as in lemma in particular w and we introduced a coupling constant note that this choice of w is innitesimaly form bounded with respect to h even if w because of the sobolev embedding the hamiltonian thus makes sense as a self adjoint operator the gibbs state at temperature t for this hamiltonian is by denition the minimizer of the free energy functional dened for mixed states over entropy minimizing over all states we clearly obtain trf t trf log f the rst term is the energy the second the von neumann where the partition function xes the trace equal to and satises t exp t h t log where is the minimum free energy it is useful to introduce the notion of k particle reduced density matrix for states oved for a diagonal state of the form f gn gn hn hn m this is the operator on the k particles space hk dened trhk n trhn ak s for every bounded operator ak on hk these are helpful for rewriting expressions involving only k particle operators in particular the number operator involves only one body terms so the expected particle number can be computed as xn h i h i i the energy involves only two body terms and we have h trf trh n trf w i h h t the limit we shall consider is i t the rationale here is that to see a non trivial eect of the temperature in a bosonic system t should be rather large because of the bose einstein condensation phenomenon we alluded to before then one can easily get convinced that the expected particle number behaves as t in this limit for example consider the case the one particle density matrix can be computed explicitly eh t after dividing by t this clearly converges to the k case of since we assume the latter object to have a nite trace in view of it is clear that the expected particle t is thus number of the free gibbs state grows like t taking the coupling constant the equivalent in the grand canonical setting of the canonical limit discussed in section where the coupling constant scaled as the inverse of the particle number note that in case in this argument is no longer valid and the particle number will grow much faster than t this makes this case much more dicult to deal with which is why it is not included in this note and we refer to the original paper main theorem let us now state the main result of this note proved in it concerns the limit of the previously dened grand canonical ensemble one should not expect a convergence of the gibbs states themselves since their expected particle number diverges neither should one hope for an estimate in some norm for well known reasons that we shall not elaborate on here the correct objects to look at are the k body density matrices with k much smaller than the particle number in particular k xed will do the results on ground states and dynamics we have mentioned in section are all of the form of estimates on such objects and so is the following theorem on positive temperature equilibrium states partial trace is taken over the symmetric space only n rougerie theorem derivation of nonlinear gibbs measures let h be given by or and w satisfy the assumptions of lemma let be the gibbs measure dened therein for every xed k we have t k t zh uk ih strongly in the trace class norm in the limit some comments when is replaced by a nite dimensional hilbert space canonical versions of this theorem have been proved before see and appendix b the collection of all the moments of for k appearing in the right hand side of characterizes uniquely this measure is thus the natural unique limit object for the grand canonical ensemble roughly speaking is a way of making rigorous the approximation t where is the coherent state built on v z u u vk the variational formulation the proof of theorem is variational the gence of density matrices is obtained as a corollary of estimates on the minimum free energy or equivalently the partition function an important diculty is however that is cult to control directly in particular because even at this quantity diverges very fast when t our strategy is therefore to instead deal with the dierence between the free energies at and that is to count everything relatively to the free gibbs state this is possible because as one easily realizes t also minimizes the relative free energy functional trf w t trf log w t trf log log log h i amongst all mixed states the second term in the above is the quantum relative entropy of with respect to which is always positive the inmum of the above functional equals t log studying the minimization of thus allows for a direct access to the ratio of the acting and non interacting partition functions which will converge to some limit although the partition functions themselves diverge we obtain theorem as a corollary of the estimate theorem asymptotics of the free energy let zr be the relative partition function for the gibbs measure dened in lemma with the free gibbs measure in the limit we have zr exp z t log zr in order to complete the variational framework of the proof one characterizes log zr as the inmum of some variational problem of which is the solution indeed one easily sees that minimizes z w d log d z d log d amongst all absolutely continuous measures on the one body hilbert space h the second term is the classical relative entropy of relative to ih z z the semi classical nature of theorems and is now apparent we have to relate the minimization problems for the quantum and classical free energy functionals and this means that we need to understand how to describe quantum objects operators on a hilbert space in terms of classical objects probability measures this requires specic tools and we shall review some of these in the next section since we work on a variational problem we can provide separately an upper and a lower bound on the free energy the former essentially follows from the evaluation of the free energy of a trial state of the form using some projected states in an appropriate way this can be done by adapting well known tools of nite dimensional semi classical analysis the lower bound is as usual the tougher part and we will try to give some of the main ideas in the sequel some tools of the proof the rst point is to characterize the limits of quantum states over the fock space in terms of classical objects i e probability measures over the one body hilbert space this is the object of the so called quantum finetti theorem that we discuss rst it will be rather clear from this kind of results how one can deal with the interaction energy term in the relative entropy term requires new specic tools discussed in a second subsection quantum finetti measures the main message of the quantum orem is informally that for many practical purposes any bosonic state looks like a convex combination of product states a little bit more precisely if one picks a bosonic n state with n large and look at its k body density matrix for k small one obtains almost a convex combination of product states there is a vast literature devoted to rigorous statements and proofs of these claims we shall not review it here in details see for the purpose of this note we rely n rougerie on recent approaches and versions of the theorem due mainly to ammari nier and nam rougerie to deal with the case where in some improvements are necessary provided in but for the proof of the previous theorems the following result of is sucient theorem grand canonical quantum finetti theorem let n be a sequence of states on the fock space sequence n such that for all n f h assume that there exists a i then there exists a unique borel probability measure on h such that along a subsequence h k n trhk n ck n uk ih zh weakly in the trace class for every integer some comments the measure is called the finetti measure of the sequence n it is the classical object we are after its existence is a rather general fact based mostly on the bosonic symmetry of the states under consideration theorems and can be rephrased as saying that the finetti measure of the sequence t is the nonlinear gibbs measure here n should be thought of as a semiclassical parameter essentially forcing the particle number to behave as n to apply this result in our context we need to check that holds with n t and t in the context of this note this is not too dicult because the particle number is well under control bounds in some state naturally translate into trace class bounds on the expectation of on the k body density matrix since we here get convergence of density matrices a lower bound to the interaction energy term in follows from this theorem n berezin lieb inequality for the relative entropy there remains to understand how to estimate the relative entropy term in one should keep the following in mind contrarily to the energy it is not expressed in terms of reduced density matrices only it genuinely depends of the full state one should not undo the relative entropy to consider only the von neumnann entropies of and t directly since we do not expect a good control on those the main tool to link quantum entropy terms to their semiclassical counterparts are the so called berezin lieb inequalities since we work in innite dimensions and we can not undo the relative entropy to rely on known inequalities we need the following new result and theorem berezin lieb inequality for the relative entropy let n rem let and be their finetti measures then d d log log n n lim inf n n log n d d trf n d z be two sequences of states satisfying the assumptions of some comments clearly this will give the desired lower bound to the relative entropy term in if we can prove rst that the finetti measure of the free gibbs state is given by since all the density matrices of can be explicitly computed this is easily shown by direct inspection for the proof of this result we rely heavily on a constructive approach to the proof of theorem indeed not only the existence of the measure is crucial but also the precise way one can approach it by explicit functions of the states the link with semi classics proceeds by seeing the finetti measure both as a lower symbol covariant symbol husimi function anti wick quantization and as an approximate upper symbol contravariant symbol wigner measure wick tion based on a coherent state decomposition made of projectors onto states of the form joint convexity we also rely on deep properties of the quantum relative entropy and monotonicity under two positive trace preserving maps these are in fact equivalent to the strong subadditivity of the quantum entropy a crucial property proved by lieb and
