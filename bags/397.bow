r a m v h o r t s a v i x r a big bang nucleosynthesis linking inner space and outer s burles k m nollett and m s turner university of chicago a series of nuclear reactions took place when the universe was seconds old and made the lightest elements in the periodic table the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis make it a cornerstone of the hot bang cosmology it also leads to the most accurate determination of the baryon density of the universe provides the linchpin in the case for the existence of nonbaryonic dark matter and permits the study of fundamental physics in regimes beyond the reach of terrestrial laboratories a brief history two of the most pressing problems of the rst half of this century were the energy source of stars and the origin of the chemical elements in the the rst puzzle was solved when hans bethe and others worked out the nuclear reactions that power stars like the sun nuclear physicists then turned to the stars to solve the second puzzle however by the end of the they were ready to abandon them in von weizsacker articulated the dominant view no element heavier than can be built up to any appreciable extent therefore we must assume that the heavy elements were built up before the stars in george gamow began talking about the big bang origin of the elements in the paper that marks the beginning of big bang thesis bbn gamow his student ralph alpher and hans bethe proposed that the periodic table was built up by neutron capture minutes after the big bang critical physics corrections made by chushiro hayashi enrico fermi and anthony turkevich led to the seminal paper of alpher robert herman and james follin that described correctly the big bang synthesis of large amounts of and little else as fermi and turkevich had pointed out coulomb barriers and the lack of stable nuclei with mass and clude signicant nucleosynthesis beyond bbn required a hot beginning and in alpher and herman predicted a k temperature for the relic radiation now known as the cosmic microwave background cmb of a poster on the theme great discoveries in astronomy in the last years produced for the aps centennial meeting in fred hoyle e margaret and georey burbidge and william fowler and independently a g w cameron showed that essentially all of the elements beyond can be made in stars but under very dierent conditions than von weizsacker and others considered interestingly enough hoyle was impelled to work on stellar nucleosynthesis because of his attachment to the steady state cosmology which lacked an explosive beginning years later hermann bondi another father of the steady state referred to the work of hoyle and collaborations as the most important achievement of the state theory a year before the discovery of the cmb hoyle and roger tayler made the observational case for a large primeval abundance of around by mass and suggested a big bang explanation after the discovery of the cmb by penzias and wilson in the bbn calculations were rened by p j e peebles and robert wagoner fowler and hoyle explaining the large primeval abundance of was a striking triumph of the hot big bang ory in hubert reeves jean audouze fowler and david n schramm focused attention on deuterium whose big bang production depends tively on the density of ordinary matter baryons the reasoning in this paper together with the detection of deuterium in the interstellar medium ism led to an upper limit to the baryon density of no more than of the critical density by the early primordial abundances of all four light elements cooked in the big bang d and had been determined and the dance of the predicted abundances with the measured abundances was used both as a test of the big bang framework and a means of constraining the baryon density the hot big bang model had become the standard ogy and bbn was one of its cornerstones further bbn began to play an important role in probing fundamental physics in their inuential per gary steigman david schramm and james gunn used big bang production to constrain the number of light neutrino species not only was their limit an important one but it also helped to open the eld of cosmology and particle physics in the rst accurate measurement of the primordial deuterium dance by david tytler and scott burles marked the beginning of a new precision era of bbn this measurement xes the baryon density to a sion of around and in turn leads to accurate predictions of the primeval abundances of the other light elements this development promises to extend and sharpen the power of bbn to probe cosmology fundamental physics and astrophysics how it works big bang nucleosynthesis is very dierent from the stellar nucleosynthesis that produces the heavier elements it is a nonequilibrium process that took place over the course of a few minutes in an expanding radiation dominated plasma with high entropy photons per baryon and lots of free neutrons in contrast much of stellar nucleosynthesis occurs in equilibrium over billions of years at relatively low entropy less than one photon per baryon and no free neutrons the densities in stars are around g while in the big bang they were closer g the theoretical description of bbn requires only a few basic assumptions general relativity the standard bang cosmology and the standard model of particle physics along with a dozen nuclear cross sections which are well measured at the relevant energies at times much less than one second after the beginning the universe was a hot k rapidly expanding plasma with most of its energy in radiation and relativistic particles in particular there were roughly equal numbers of electrons positrons neutrinos and antineutrinos of each species and photons nucleons were outnumbered by more than a billion to one there were essentially no composite nuclei and weak processes like n p e maintained the ratio of neutrons to protons at its thermal equilibrium value of around unity at about one second the temperature had dropped to around k the weak processes became ineective and the neutron proton ratio leveled o at about growing amounts of d and were present in amounts dictated by nuclear statistical equilibrium the processes ing this equilibrium slowed relative to the temperature evolution because of decreasing temperatures and densities after ve minutes most trons were in nuclei and most protons remained free see figure much smaller amounts of d and were synthesized but the low density growing coulomb barriers and stability gaps at masses ve and eight worked against the formation of larger nuclei the elemental composition of the verse subsequently remained unchanged until the formation of the rst stars several billion years later the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis with theoretical errors are shown as a function of the baryon density in the central figure observations confront predictions the big bang predictions for the light element abundances depend only upon the mean baryon density the primeval abundances of the four light elements are not measured easily or simultaneously here is a brief summary since the big bang its abundance has grown because stars make the primordial abundance is inferred from measurements of the h ratio in regions of hot ionized gas hii regions in other galaxies the figure shows a compilation of these measurements as a function of the oxygen abundance an indicator of stellar processing izotov and thuan infer yp deuterium it is the most fragile of the light elements all astrophysical processes destroy d and so its abundance has been declining since the big bang in rogerson and york measured the deuterium abundance in the local ism this measurement provided a lower limit to the big bang production and an upper limit to the baryon density in tytler and burles determined the primeval deuterium abundance by measuring the d h ratio in several high z redshift hydrogen clouds d these hydrogen clouds are seen by their distinctive ly absorption features in the spectra of qsos with the deuterium feature isotopically shifted to the blue by zcloud a see figure the primeval deuterium abundance pins down the baryon density g lithium some stars destroy lithium and others produce it the primeval value is inferred from the abundance in the atmospheres of the oldest pop ii stars in the halo of our galaxy while the less massive halo stars have depleted some of their lithium the lithium plateau for stars with higher surface temperatures suggests that these stars have not see figure however stellar models indicate that there could have been up to a factor of two depletion on the lithium plateau stars burn primeval deuterium to beyond that little is certain it has been argued that the net destruction or production beyond this is small if so then the sum of d remains relatively constant measurements support this idea under this assumption the primeval deuterium abundance together with the measured abundance of d in the ism imply that since the cosmologists have spoken of a concordance interval for the baryon density where the predicted and measured abundances for all four light elements are consistent within their uncertainties because the dances span nine orders of magnitude this is no mean feat and it establishes the validity of the standard cosmology when the universe was seconds old and a billion times smaller the accurate determination of the primeval deuterium abundance changed the strategy it pegged the baryon density and led to accurate predictions for the other light elements when the abundance is known better a comparison with the predicted abundance yp will be an important consistency test when the issue of stellar depletion is settled and the theoretical errors are reduced lithium will oer a similar test on the other hand will serve best to probe of galactic and stellar evolution the central figure summarizes the present situation showing concordance intervals for each element based upon uncertainties and the baryon density predicted by the deuterium ment vertical band a remarkable cross check of bbn will be possible when precision measurements of cmb anisotropy made by the map and planck satellites determine the baryon density to similar accuracy based upon the completely independent physics of gravity driven acoustic oscillations see figure probing cosmology and particle physics baryonic and nonbaryonic dark matter for more than a decade the bbn concordance interval has stood as the most accurate determination of the baryon density the measurement of the primordial d abundance ushered in a new level of precision expressed as a fraction of the critical density the baryon density is b for km it varies as h this has several important implications rst since stars contribute a mass density that is about ten times less it implies that most of the baryons must be dark most likely in the form of diuse hot gas second measurements of the total matter density indicate that it is eight times larger m bbn leads us to the remarkable conclusion that most of the matter is something other than baryons the leading candidate is elementary particles such as axions or neutralinos left over from the earliest ery moments while a self consistent picture of structure formation also argues for nonbaryonic dark matter bbn is truly the linchpin in the case using helium to count neutrinos the conditions at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis are very dierent than those available in terrestrial laboratories and so it is not surprising that bbn has been used as a heavenly laboratory to probe physics in regimes that go beyond the reach of earthly laboratories bbn has constrained the properties of neutrinos nucleons and nuclei axions and other hypothetical particles as well as tested general relativity and the predictions of theories that attempt to unify the forces and particles of nature the most striking example of the power of the heavenly laboratory is the well known limit to the number of neutrino species the physics works like this at the time of bbn the energy density of the universe which controls its expansion rate was dominated by a mal bath of relativistic particles including neutrinos and antineutrinos more neutrino species means a higher energy density and faster expansion this leads to more neutrons and hence more production see figure thus the abundance can be used to constrain the number of neutrino species and thereby the number of families of quarks and leptons since there is one neutrino for each family in when steigman schramm and gunn tained a limit of no more than neutrino species the direct laboratory limit was around a truly impressive improvement by the time the colliders at slac and cern showed directly that the number of neutrino species was the bbn limit stood at no more than today the bbn limit stands at no more than at and is used to constrain the possible existence of other new light weakly interacting particles selected bibliography beginnings g gamow phys rev r alpher h bethe and g gamow phys rev ready to go r alpher j follin and r
