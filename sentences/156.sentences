science teacher education in the knowledge society good practice at the university of geneva andreas mllera university of geneva the present text summarizes several factors considered as essential for teacher education according to the state of current research and best practice with a focus on science teacher education and as realized at the university of geneva
teacher education at universities professional schools of education and other structural elements in this section it is argued that teacher education at universities has a natural if not necessary place in an educational system well prepared for the future and what institutional and structural elements may support such a role in general and in particular for science teacher education
the university institute of teacher education iuteb of the university of geneva is a professional school of education pse
at the international level such a structure is considered as one of the best approaches for education initial and continuing of teachers in line with internationally recognized models like the pse at stanford
in short the main objective of a pse is to offer a teacher education structure that integrates the fundamental elements of research academic teaching school practice
for this purpose a first basic feature of a pse is an academic education both oriented towards the practice of the teaching and based on research both in education and in the taught disciplines
in knowledge societies the education of teachers as best guarantors of general and scientific literacy of future citizens must have the best available foundations in the scientific knowledge and also in the attitudes and approaches of how to develop and confirm it in short in the best available foundations in research
universities are the best institutions to ensure such a strong foundation in research taught disciplines educational sciences
the second guiding idea is to achieve a unity of teaching and research which is a well established standard for the vast majority of academic disciplines but too often neglected in teacher education
specifically this requires to establish discipline based education research such as science education research at the faculty level as achieved at the iute of geneva with professors for various disciplinary education research with for science education
finally the third basic feature is to bring together the disciplines necessary for teacher education educational sciences discipline based education in a common interfaculty structure with dual affiliation of the chairs to their primary faculty
this is a good foundation to ensure coherence and appropriate coordination between the components of teacher education and a vivid academic connection with their respective
together these features do not automatically guarantee success as teacher education is a multifactorial and sometimes quite controversial task with many stakeholders
but it is to the best of present knowledge one of the solutions with the highest chances and potential on the structural level
at an institutional level the pse in geneva is part of the second largest university in switzerland which enjoys an international reputation in particular for science
as such the iute is the only institution of this kind in switzerland and at the european level it belongs to a group of a pse at university with a high standard of research such as the technical university of munich
three further specificities in geneva are important for an effective teacher education
first the integration of initial and continuous education in the same institution which is the only way to assure the integration of research education practice as essential strength of a pse also for in service teachers
this is crucial for two reasons the initial in service years are known to be decisive for the development of the professional attitude of teachers
at any time the vast majority of teachers are obviously in service teachers who have to teach live long learning to their pupils and in order to do so have to practice it themselves
thus both for the critical initial phase and for live long learning continuous professional education is best placed in a pse if it is to be based on an effective synthesis of research education and practice
second an understanding of school education and thus of teacher education as a coherent whole from primary school to secondary ii
an important characteristic of this is that the teaching qualification is awarded simultaneously for secondary level i and ii
this strongly fosters a good understanding of what is done on both levels and of the transition between them actually many teachers are employed on both levels
the possibility of this is also a considerable advantage with respect to the labour market
another important aspect is the link with primary education
it is well known that the basis for science interest and knowledge is laid in primary school where however most teachers do not have a solid science background
the cooperation between teacher education for the primary and secondary levels in the same institution can help in that respect
for science there is a contribution for primary teacher education on a regular basis and other forms of cooperation within science education projects
third a faculty of science and institute of teacher education university of geneva
the present text is based on many exchanges and discussions within the university and the community of teacher education in switzerland but represents the personal point of view of the author
the acronym iute was chosen in order to be similar to the one in french i
e
iufe institut universitaire de formation des enseignants the good integration of science education as academic discipline into the science faculty and the strong commitment of the latter for educational matters important e

as valuable resource for initial continuous and lifelong learning of science teachers as mentioned above
in this respect a specific strength for science education and science teacher education in geneva is the existence of a very broad and high quality spectrum of out of school learning offers established by the faculty of science most notably the scienscope
its objective is to foster a positive attitude and understanding of science among the population in general and young people in particular
it offers entertaining and fascinating workshops on more than topics for more than participants a year
disciplines included are biology chemistry computer science mathematics and physics and soon the earth sciences
moreover bioutils providing kits and expert support on topics of modern biology for the classroom and the stellarium gornergrat a accessible observatory for educational purposes have to be mentioned here
moreover there is a specific platform for keeping alive the contact of science teachers with their science called and supported by the faculty of science and the dip
all these offers are also opportunities where teacher education initial and continuous using a unique approach to experience the sciences takes place and where a vivid exchange with in service teachers helps to keep alive their own contact with and interest for their discipline
science teacher education along these lines runs well in geneva
the accreditation report for the iute acknowledges the realization of the guiding ideas mentioned above in particular research based teacher education and the good coordination between theory and practice
evaluation of initial science teacher education courses are good to very good
this is due among other factors to the evidence based approach in education as described in sect

another indicator is a very low number of science teacher students not successfully finishing theirs studies
for continuous professional education there is a rich offer by collegues from science and science education with good attendance by teachers
finally there are several cases where in service teachers who graduated at the iufe later on seek contact with the science education group and get involved in the teacher education program for the younger collegues and propose and participate in research and development projects in science education
the faculty of science of the university of geneva with the structures approaches and commitment as described above and with about of its graduates working in the teaching profession later on thus being its largest job sector is well placed to be a major acting force for science teacher education so important for our society
however the claim is not that these specificities are realized in an ideal way in geneva but that they work as important elements of good practice for a successful science teacher education potentially useful also in other circumstances
evidence based education
background the remarkable feature of the evidence is that the greatest effects on student learning occur when teachers become learners of their own teaching
hattie j

visible learning for teachers evidence based practice is the approach to base decisions on the best available evidence in the sense of the best possible in particular systematic use of existing knowledge and research
the earliest example in this respect was evidence based medicine ebm i
e
conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients as one of its pioneers put it
the common ground with evidence based education is that a precious value and objective good health or good education has to be realized with limited means
this has led to a very strong current of research and practical implementation in evidence based science education in the last two decades
the work of hattie based on more than meta analyses comprising more than individuals is considered to be groundbreaking in this area
other highly influential sources are the best evidence encyclopedia of the john hopkins university and work done at the stanford pse mentioned above
by way of example results of general importance here are the considerable effect sizes for achievement by providing formative evaluation cohen d
and by cooperative vs
individualistic learning

other important research is about affective and motivational aspects eg
about interest and efficacy believes or curiosity
a further informative example is about homework a topic strongly debated among parents teachers and researchers overall effects are between small and medium from
to
but a much better image is obtained when taking account of feedback as co factor which when given or not leads to a large contrast between strong and weak effects d
vs
d

this is an illustrative example of three general statements i ebe and meta analyses can only be as good as important co factors have been taken into account simplistic recipes are not a goal one is looking for
the co factor in question here feedback is consistent with the strong positive effects for formative evaluation a kind of systematic feedback mentioned above
as a matter of fact development of improved methodology allows for research synthesis aiming at this kind of more detailed analysis and going increasingly beyond classical meta analysis
last but not least one sees how ebe can help to prevent from fruitless debates such as about homework hitherto based all too often on mere conviction and ideology
in the sense of hatties quote above ebe is the approach to provide a systematic and conscientious base of best evidence for teachers to become learners of their own teaching
as a word of caution however it has to be mentioned that there is a thorough debate about ebe as always in educational matters and it is certainly not its claim to guarantee all by itself a solution to all problems in science education and science teacher education as evidenced by the following statement by millar et al
we need to work towards a situation in which research evidence is routinely an explicit input to teachers decision making but where it is also accepted that this must be weighed judiciously alongside other kinds of knowledge to reach a decision that can be rationally defended
it is such a well balanced point of view we subscribe to in the approach described here
in science education and science teacher education in particular the evidence based approach has seen a very intensive development
it is among the strongest ones for educational research on school subject matters together with mathematics education and the idea has found strong support among many scientists interested in effective teaching and learning of their disciplines also on highest reputational level
in particular the physics nobel price winner c
wieman has devoted his work in the last decade to science education research since at the pse in stanford
several illustrative findings for three aspects might serve as example both on the cognitive and the affective level see following sections

learning effectiveness in science education should be founded on scientific teaching in which teaching is approached with the same rigor as science at its best handelsman j
al
science for improving learning effectiveness a first illustrative example are collaborative learning strategies
when applied to science learning they yield strong positive effects d
consistent with and even more pronounced than the effects found across all disciplines see above
another example highly relevant for science education is inquiry based learning ibl which finds strong support on the political level
however there is little empirical support for the effectiveness of ibl d

looking more closely a meta analysis on ibl in science by furtak et al
has shown that teacher guidance is an decisive moderator effect sizes are more than twice as large with guidance than without
and
respectively
unguided inquiry as ibl is often understood is thus not an effective approach for science learning
as in the case of homework a differentiated quantitatively based stance has to replace a simplistic and sometimes ideological one
research syntheses and meta analyses for the big picture of ebse are available and provide a sound basis for science education
an interesting example for results on a more fine grained level is the improvement of science literacy and understanding by inclusion of astronomy topics in the classroom or in planetariums from primary level pupils to teacher students
results show positive effects for general science literacy eg
the origin of seasons or the motion of earth and moon or more specific competencies eg
spatial abilities with many effect sizes


tab
in note below gives an overview of some selected results as an example of how ebse can inform about quite specific questions
we will come back to astronomy in the next paragraph

raising motivation and interest this has been the most exciting thing i have done on this degree so far primary teacher student using a remote access telescope in an introductory astronomy course a very important example here are hands on activities which are considered by many practitioners as a strongly motivating element for learners
for science learning a large sample study n age group a has indeed shown that they are the type of learning activities meeting the highest degree of interest high very interest of learners
a recent study confirms hands on activities as strong predictors of science interest at school
moreover another large sample study conducted by the cooperation has shown a large impact of hands on learning also on science achievement d

it is clear that science teachers have to be aware of this and other effective means of fostering interest and learning among pupils and also about their relative strengths
reviews and theoretical synthesis of this and other important affective factors exist and provide a good basis for science teacher education
while the impact of hands on approaches on science interest probably does not come as a surprise even though knowing how much in the spirit if ebse is certainly superior to merely knowing that there are more recent developments where evidence about their impact is useful
one important case of this are out of school learning offers like the scienscope bioutils and the stellarium gornergrat mentioned above
a considerable body of research indeed supports their great motivational potential research journals highly influential sources such as the national research council and reference works
as rennie puts it an enjoyable and successful visit experience is an important outcome because it can predispose the learner to engage in further cognitive learning
motivation and willingness to engage in further instruction are most likely to be the important affective outcomes of a visit
for instance a series of studies on more than sites has shown quite positive results for enjoyment general appreciation of various out of school science learning offers of maximal value consistently across several countries france germany switzerland age groups primary to secondary level ii various settings single and multiple visits degree of guidance and disciplines biology chemistry physics and across more than a decade
ebse provides also for more detailed partially unexpected results such as that among all areas of science astronomy topics are among the most interesting ones for young people much more interesting than many conventional school topics rose relevance in science education
similar results were found in several different countries within and outside the scope of the rose study eg
within rose austria england finland germany ireland israel sweden see
in an independent investigation osborne collins state the central message as follows aspects of the subject that amazed or fascinated were limited to those topics that had personal relevance either to their everyday lives or those that dealt with existential questions of identity such as astronomy and cosmology
note that these findings are particularly important in view of the fact that the investigated pupils were of an age where decisions about their future school and professional development are about to be taken
moreover the strong motivational potential of astronomy as science topic applies also for teacher education as evidenced by the statement at the beginning of this section
in view of the notable positive effects both for both interest and learning see above there are strong reasons to include astronomy in science teaching at school and a in science teacher education
in the science teacher education program in geneva this is taken account of in several compulsory teaching units of initial education and also by a series of continuous professional education offers
one question to be solved here is that astronomy is rarely taught as a school discipline as such and one has to find ways for an embedding in existing curricula see note
it is here that an offer like the stellarium gornergrat see above gains its full weight
first it offers first hand access to astronomical images and data of unprecedented quality for educational purposes
second learning activities developed and tested by participating teachers ensure practical feasibility and an adequate embedding in the local curricula

measurement figuring out what to measure and how well to measure it is critical in all fields
although the specifics for how to do this are different between physics and education the basic methods are much the same
c
wieman in finally the very idea of ebe is obviously based on the possibility to reliably measure changes and outcomes of educational variables for cognitive motivational and other variables
the development of instruments for educational diagnosis measurement and assessment has received sustained attention over the past two decades
among other reasons there is an increasing awareness for the need of educational experimentation tested by reliable measurements very much in the sense of ebe
teachers have to know whether a given approach really increases understanding or motivation and they have to be able to test this in their own classrooms
a field of particular interests are concept tests probing for intuitive conceptions of misconceptions such as the ideas that the seasons are caused by different distances to the sun that a moving object looses force or that dolphins are fish
such ideas are found to be widespread and hard to change in many science fields even among university students see eg

teachers have to be aware of these learning difficulties of ways how to overcome them and again to diagnose them and look for possible change in their own classrooms
in sum measurement instruments have an essential role in science education research practice and teacher education and will certainly become even more important in the future
conclusion teacher education is a central part of an educational system as studies on university level it is the last stage of an educational trajectory and at the same time is the basis and starting point for the educational quality for many generations of school students
if universities as strongholds of culture and knowledge in a society want to ensure the transmission of their values and knowledge in order to have good students and to ensure the academic succession but also for the development of society in general they have to strongly engage themselves for teacher education
a promising structure for this is a professional school of education but other approaches do exist
for these goals a professional school of education appears to be a promising institutional structure and evidence based education to provide the most reliable knowledge basis
as stated several times it is not claimed that the suggestions made here and their realization in geneva are ideal ones or the only but they are proposed as an example of good practice possibly useful also for the discussion in other settings
notes supplementary information the present contribution is written from the point of view of a pse at a general research oriented university
it does not discuss nor exclude specialized teacher education universities for which in fact promising formats similar to the pse discussed here exist in particular when in close cooperation with a general university
the basic definition is cohen d mt where mt and mc are the means of some variable of interest for the treatment and control group respectively and sd is the either the pooled standard deviation or that of the control group
in simple terms thus measures the impact of an intervention is units of standard deviations of the sample under consideration
usual effect size levels as established from comparison of a great many of studies in different areas are small

medium

or large

many modifications and refinements of the concept of effect size haven been developed and are used in the literature see eg

second many topics of the regular curriculum for several disciplines in particular physics mathematics geography can be taught with astronomical examples and activities benefitting from their large motivational potential for example basic circle geometry concept of velocity activity about the course of stars in the night sky on a more advanced level trigonometry activity about the height of the lunar mountains links to history trigonometry concept of angular velocity activity about jupiter s big red spot
moreover there are compulsory courses like introduction to the scientific method in the curricula for secondary level i and ii where important contents are linked almost naturally to astronomical examples and activities orders of magnitude data evaluation modelling
