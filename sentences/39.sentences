will be inserted by the editor text to multi level mindmaps a novel method for hierarchical visual abstraction of natural language text mohamed elhoseiny ahmed elgammal received date accepted date abstract mindmapping is a well known technique used in note taking which encourages learning and studying
mindmapping has been manually adopted to help present knowledge and concepts in a visual form
unfortunately there is no reliable automated approach to generate mindmaps from natural language text
this work rstly introduces mindmap multilevel visualization concept which is to jointly sualize and summarize textual information
the visualization is achieved pictorially across multiple levels using semantic information i
e
ontology while the rization is achieved by the information in the highest levels as they represent abstract information in the text
this work also presents the rst automated approach that takes a text input and generates a mindmap visualization out of it
the approach could visualize text documents in multilevel mindmaps in which a high level mindmap node could be expanded into child mindmaps
the proposed method involves derstanding of the input text and converting it into intermediate detailed meaning representation dmr
the dmr is then visualized with two modes single level or multiple levels which is convenient for larger text
the generated mindmaps from both approaches were evaluated based on human subject experiments performed on amazon mechanical turk with various parameter settings

review revision
creating mindmaps itself is also interesting compared with linear text
it also improves imagination and meanwhile it is fun
linear note taking has served as one of the greatest impediments to learning says tony buzan
however he claimed that linear note taking constraints the brain s potentials by forcing it to use limited modes of expression and hence it fails to stimulate creativity
according to buzan the main motivation behind ping technique is that unlike linear text using pictorial representation of ideas lates both sides of the brain left and right
however there are scientic doubts about buzan s argument on the brain hemispheres
recently neurologists at utah university performed a two year study on people which shows that the brain is more complex than this claim of left and right sided brain
they divided the brain into regions and they found no evidence that the human subjects had a stronger right or left sided brain network
despite that buzan s justication of mindmaps by brain hemispheres is mere popular psychology and not scientically justied there are a lot of studies that shows that the mindmapping is a powerful and effective technique to access information and to encourage learning studying and reading e

we argue that mindmapping is not only a note taking tool but also can be developed to serve as a powerful tool for joint text more the

converting a text paragraph to a mindmap would provide an easier way to visually access the knowledge and ideas in the text
one of the reasons why many people may not create mindmaps is that it needs a huge mental effort and concentration specially for mindmapping a big text
besides only few people are creative enough to draw good mindmaps
to the best of our knowledge there is no existing method to build mindmaps from raw text according to the joint text summarization and visualization concept that we develop in this per
the goal of this work is to build a step in that direction by developing the rst framework that takes a text input and generates a mindmap visualization out of it a former version was presented in
our framework is constructed to visualize large text documents in multilevel mindmap in which a high level mindmap node could be expanded into a child mindmap
figure shows the mindmap visualization of the shakespeare example generated by our method in a single level and multiple levels his life and work information are expanded as two child mindmaps
fig

there are various potential applications for these versions of automatically ated mindmaps that we are developing
for example audio recording of notes can be converted into text that is passed into our framework to generate a mindmap notes
a lecturer can utilize the framework to prepare presentations by converting text to mindmaps
furthermore the generated hierarchical mindmaps would help make mindmap presentations more common due to minor effort and time needed to create them
finally mindmaps visualization could help users of electronic book readers to better access information through them
the contributions of this paper are
we introduce mindmapping as an approach to jointly visualize and summarize textual information
visualization is achieved pictorially across multiple levels using semantic information i
e
ontology while summarization is achieved by the information in the highest levels
our work could also be viewed as a method to visually abstract textual information in multiple levels

novel approach to generate single and multilevel mindmaps from pure text and
two approaches were proposed for retrieving relevant pictures from the web

subjects
the rest of this paper is organized as follows
section presents the related ature
section to section describe the proposed framework and techniques
tion describes the evaluation procedures and shows the results using different tem parameters
section presents our conclusion and the future work
related work our formulation addresses the problem as a hybrid between text summarization and visualization
in the context of text summarization the top level mindmap serves as a summarized abstraction of the document
meanwhile the detailed tion of textual content could be visually accessed through a hierarchy of mindmaps
this section presents related work in each of text summarization visualization a connection to concept topic maps and mindmapping existing systems

text summarization several approaches have been proposed for text summarization key approaches follow
conroy and oleary used hidden markov models hmms to model the problem by sentence extraction selection from a document considering local dencies between sentences
later osborne used log linear models to obviate the feature independence assumption in previous models as he claimed and showed pirically that the system produced better extracts than a naive bayes model with a prior appended to both models
then kaikhah et al trained a neural network model from the labels and the features for each sentence of an article that could infer title suppressed due to excessive length the proper ranking of sentences in a test document
other approaches use deep ural language processing e

where marcu et al merged the discourse based heuristics with traditional heuristics
while text summarization provides a reasonable resolution to the growing formation overload it does not provide an organized access to the document mation
this limits its capability to structurally localize the information of user s interest in the given document which introduces a key motivation for our multilevel mindmap visualization concept

text visualization some of the state of the art text visualization techniques build on tag clouds
ples include work conducted by ibm in wordle which is a web based text tion method that creates a tag cloud like displays with careful attention to phy color and decomposition
the generated clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source text
van ham et al
presented phrasenet technique which diagrams the relationships between different words in the text
it uses a simple form of pattern matching to provide multiple views of the cepts contained in a book speech or poem
recently afzal et al integrated tial constraints to automatically visualize textual information on typograhical maps
there are three signicant differences differentiate our work from the aforementioned works
first their algorithms do not involve deep understanding of the text
second each node is visualized with the word itself
however in mindmaps visual nodes could be mapped into pictures of a concept and its properties e

car with red color attribute
third our approach can generate multilevel representation which is not supported by wordle phrasenet or afzal s method
fig
wordle left and phrasenet right
topic models and semantic representations have been adopted to help organize and visualize information
in this direction feng et al
developed a model for multimodal meaning representation based on linguistic and visual context
the proach exploits enormous resource of documents and associated images available on the web
a relevant application is the automatic conversion of text to animation
ma proposed lexical visual semantic representation lvsr which connects linguistic semantics to the visual semantics and is suitable for action execution
this m elhoseiny et al
application involves deep analysis of the text converting it into user dened concept by which it converts the text into actions to be performed on models
in addition coyne et al
presented a method that incorporates lexical and real world edge to depict scenes from language
however these approaches are constrained to limited number of predesigned models and relations and are not hierarchical
cently dou et al presented an approach to visualize text collections using topic hierarchies
while their approach provides a reasonable access for visually exporing text corpus our approach addresses pictorial visualization and abstraction of a chosen textual document by the mindmap visualization concept
in addition the explored hierarchy in are topic based while the hierarchy provided by our visualization is based on semantic abstraction of the textual input content
as an illustration our approach could be integrated with the approach to visualize a document selected by exploring the topic hierarchies organized by

topic maps and concept maps concept maps have been used to express people s understanding about a specic topic
for few decades this tool has attracted people of all ages and different edge domains
they include concepts usually enclosed as boxes or circles and tionships between these concepts indicated by a connecting line
topic maps are very similar to concept maps while topic maps are standardized
it has been dened as a form of semantic web technology and a lot of work has been done to dress interoperability between the s rdf owl sparql
the current standard is taking place under the umbrella of the committee
in contrast to concept maps and topic maps mindmapping often includes but is not limited to radial hierarchies where central ideas is in the center while connected to related entities around it and tree structures
another difference is that a mindmap reects people s thoughts about a single topic while concept topic maps can present a real or abstract system or a set of concepts which is not restricted to specic topic
the majority of the literature has focused on the representation of topic maps and concept maps to enhance some nlp tasks e

parsing word sense biguation
rather we would like to view these maps as a powerful tool that could be used to jointly visualize and summarize information
in particular we present the concept of multilevel hierarchical mindmaps as a notion of visualizing textual information in multiple levels
higher levels reects coarse information in the text document while lower levels present the ne details
we chose to name it multilevel hierarchical mindmaps because mindmaps are less restrictive on the representation than concept and topic maps topic oriented which is relevant in the setting we utilize i
e
representing information from textual description and in our experiments we focus on topics that could be presented as a single central idea which is consistent with the mindmap notion
however we argue that most of the topics could be presented a set of central ideas that could be presented by mindmaps
hence we do nt restrict our denition of hierarchical mindmaps to topics of a title suppressed due to excessive length gle central idea
we focus in this paper in the steps we designed to generate the multilevel mindmap from a textual description

existing mindmapping systems there are two ways for creating a mindmap
one way is manually by using a paper pens and colors but this requires beforehand reading and understanding the text well to design a good mindmap
another way is to use existing software that just serves as an editing canvas where user can insert pictures and create relations between them i
e
manually
examples include i mind nova mind
finally the most relevant work was conducted by hamdy et al

they sented a prototype for the mindmap automation however it was just a tion on few examples of few sentences and then it was applied in a mobile application in
there are two critical drawbacks in this approach
it is almost an uated demo
it supports only single level mindmaps
this limitation make the approach incapable of representing information of a larger text
hence it can not support our concept of simultaneously visualizing and summarizing textual tion
proposed framework our objective is to propose a method to jointly visualize and summarize visual formation we call multilevel mindmap visualization
we begin by presenting the outline of the approach through the data ow diagram in gure we will present the details in later sections
fig
data flow of the proposed multilevel mindmap generation framework m elhoseiny et al
we rst extract what we call semantically enriched parse trees septs from the input text through a text semantic preprocessing step that we implemented
the septs consist of the parse trees for each sentence augmented with disambiguated senses at each terminal node in the parse tree
furthermore for each anaphor node e

pronouns a pointer to what it refers to is stored
these septs are then verted into a detailed meaning representation dmr that represent all the tion in the text as a graph
then the dmr is converted to a multi level meaning representation mlmr which is a tree of meaning representations
each node in the mlmr tree stores a meaning representation mr starting from the root node where its mr holds the most abstract information in the text to the leaves where details are presented
the nal step in our framework is the mindmap generation which converts an input mr into its pictorial representation and dynamically allocate it on the screen
hence the mlmr could be visualized as a multilevel mindmap by traversing the mlmr tree and visualizing the mr of each node
it is worth ing that a single level mindmap could be generated by running the mindmap eration step directly on the dmr instead of generating a mindmap for each node in the mlmr
however if the input text is of a big size the single level mindmap would be quite unclear and unorganized
figure middle part shows an example where single level mindmap visualization hinders comprehension speed simplicity and clarity
however multilevel mindmap visualization is much clearer see gure bottom part
an ontology is needed for both dmr generation to understand attributes of jects subjects while creating the dmr and for mlmr generation to semantically group related entities in mlmr
ontology is also used in the mindmap generation step to determine whether a concepts needs to be pictorially represented see gure
the details of the outlined approach is presented as follows
section details the text semantic pre processing tsp step
section presents the dmr generation approach
section presents the mlmr generation
finally section presents the mindmap generation step
text semantic preprocessing tsp in this step we extract sentence wise information from plain text which we call mantically enriched parse tree sept
as aforementioned each sept consists of a parse tree anaphora resolution discourse analysis results and the intended sense for each word in the sentence
in order to compute the septs four main tasks are performed morphological analysis parsing and syntactic tural analysis which produces a single parse tree that respects the structure of given sentence
discourse analysis outputs anaphora resolution results finally word sense disambiguation wsd determines the intended sense for each word in the sentence based on wordnet
having augmented the parse trees with the senses produced by wsd and the anaphora resolution results the eration of a sept for each sentence in the text is concluded
in this work we utilized recent approaches for such a well studied phase in natural language processing as detailed in
other methods could be applied as long as they produce the septs

e

the top right part of the gure shows the meaning sense of each word that occurs in the sentences while grouped in the data structure for each statement
augmenting the parse trees with the the discourse information and senses directly produces the septs
we denote the set of septs extracted from the text by p pi i n
we dene n be a node in any of the septs we dene n
r as the node that n points to in case it points to a previously declared noun noun phrase n
n u ll otherwise

r could point to a node in a possibility different sept
we also dene n

s n u ll otherwise
dmr generation designing a meaning representation for natural language text implies ing its content and representing it in a semantically accessible way
during dmr title suppressed due to excessive length generation p is converted to a further meaningful representation which consists of conceptual frames and relations between these them
there are two types of frames in our framework entity frames and action frames
entity frames represent entities mentioned in the text persons objects while action frames represent ities in the text i
e
verbs
possible relations between the frames are case role domain and temporal relations
a case role relation represents semantic role of an entity frame in a particular action
for instance in john plays football sentence the subject john has an agent case role in the play action and the object ball frame has a theme case role in the same action
temporal relations are propositional relations that communicates the simultaneity or ordering in time of events or states
domain relations encode logical connection between action frames i
e
verbs
figure illustrates different types of case roles domain relations and temporal relations that are designed in our framework
having detected the frames and the relations the nal output of the dmr generation became a graph whose nodes are the frames action or entity frames while edges are the relations
ematically speaking we assume that dmr is a graph gd v e where e is the set of entity and action frames i
e
the nodes and e is the set of relations including case role domain and temporal relations i
e
the edges
algorithm dmrgen input p pi i n ontology o parser cfg dictionary h output gd v e is a graph of entity action frames as vertices where related frames are connected by edges initialization v e for all pi in p do c ri initialize e i and ai where e i and ai are the entity and the action frames to be detected in pi
initialize ri and temporal relations to be detected in pi
e i ai ri c ri v v e i ai
c ri r r ri t are the case role domain t where ri d and ri d and ri d ri t
t o h d ri c ri end for return gd function e a rc rd rt o h fn h if n is not null then e a rc rd rt ontology for all ch in p
children do e a rc rd rt ontology else end for end if end the dmr generation procedure is illustrated in algorithm
the set of frames v and relations e are initialized to empty sets
in order to generate the dmr each pi p is traversed and the grammatical structure is followed to dene subjects objects and verbs
entity frames are created for objects and subjects
while action frames are created for verbs
we denote the set of entity frames in the ith m elhoseiny et al
ai ei ai tence by e i end and the set of action frame in the same sentence as ai ai end
each frame is augmented with its intended sense from the node information stored in the septs i
e
n

this step also includes adding attributes of each frame if any
for example small red ball a ball entity frame is generated with attributes small and red
the attributes were detected using the parse tree structure
in this case small and red are adjective of ball
in addition the type of the attributes is determined by the ontology e

red is a color attribute
simultaneously the relations see gure were created following the syntactic ture of the sentences to connect the generated frames
no new frames are created for anaphors they are linked to the frames they refer exploiting n

the newly ated frames for each statement are added to v and they are connected by case role domain and temporal relations following the parse tree structure
these relations are then added to the edges e
we name the function that lls all the frames and relation as fillframesandrelation see algorithm
practically we implemented the function fillframesandrelations by sively traversing the given sept pi starting from the root node
each node is checked processing each grammar rule in each node in the produced parse trees this could be possibly any rule that our parser allows
each rule could be processed ently depending on whether it produces of frames and relations
for instance entity frames are added to e while processing n p node see gure syntactic analyzer output
another example is that domain relations are added to rd while cessing a rule like s where there are two statement ds separated by and preposition that indicate a reason on a result e

that and so
following the same idea it is not hard to build a function for the rules of interest that to ll the frames and the relations in each
a hash table h help retrieve each of these function based on the rule as a key
h simply returns the function that processes p s rule if one exist in h and null otherwise
having traversed all pi p by sandrelations a complete graph of all the information in text is created which is the dmr i

relations in meaning representation and their weights title suppressed due to excessive length mlmr generation figure shows our mlmr recursive generation step
initially gd meaning sentation is passed to meaning representation summarization algorithm mrsa algorithm detailed later in this section specically mrsa generates the abstracted version of gd we name parent mr gp and it connects parent abstract nodes in the gp to regions in the gd that details such abstract nodes in gp
we name those regions as dmr regions
then each of the dmr regions are processed recursively by the mlmr process if there are still big to t in the screen
this termination criterion could be dened by the number of nodes for instance
in our case we simply stop after the mr did not change from the previous iteration
the remaining part of this section details the mrsa algorithm the role of the ontology in the algorithm and how to make the mlmr generation process interactive
fig

orange blocks indicates recursion

ontology we assume that the ontology has the the property that semantically related concepts have short paths in the hierarchy of the ontology
we also assume that the concepts in the ontology could be mapped to the senses of the frames stored in the dmr
we opt to study our framework in one domain to prove that the concept works
other reason is that natural language research is still progressing towards generalizing ontologies so that it covers an arbitrary text
the ontology utilized in this work sists of concepts that we created according to the taxonomy of the historical gures topics
the ontology consists of three root nodes of work personal life m elhoseiny et al
political life the ontology is attached in the supplementary materials
concepts presented in the textual information are assumed to be found as sub nodes under one of these four root nodes
the main reason behind designing our custom ontology is to focus on the evaluation of our main contribution multilevel mindmap visualization rather than addressing ambiguity problems that exist in the available ontologies e

wordnet sumo and cyc which are out of the scope of this work
it is important to note that for each concept in the ontology we added a eld called map lex
this eld basically contains all the senses that matches these concepts
the purpose of this eld is to easily map frames in a meaning representation to its corresponding concept
hence after the dmr is generated we augmented each frame in the dmr with the corresponding concept in the ontology by nding the concept whose map lex eld contains its stored
finally each concept also contains is visual ag which indicates whether the concept could be presented as a picture

mrsa the objective of mrsa is to summarize a meaning representation mr based on the ontology and the important frames in the mr
each frame of the summarized mr is connected to regions i
e
a set of frames vc v and relations ec e in the input mr that are related to that frame
frames in the summarized mr parent mr that map to more than one frame in the input mr are denoted by group frames
figure shows the block diagram of mrsa algorithm
the rationale behind mrsa is to measure the signicance of mr frames by a weight assignment phase
it then selects the most important frames we call them main frames by clustering based on the assigned weights
then the main frames persist at the top level with surrounding actions conceptually grouped according to a conceptual metric i
e
distance tween the concepts inside the ontology hierarchy
this is achieved by a conceptual based partitioning step


weight assignment in this step a weight for each frame v of gd graph is assigned to indicate its level of signicance the higher the weight the more signicant the frame is
each of the case roles domain relations and temporal relations is assigned a constant weight depending on its type see gure for example agent may have a score different from location or reason
we observed that important entity frames have many portant relationships to the other frames
based on this observation we model the weight per entity frame as the sum of the weights of its surrounding relations see equation
w ef n k cri wcri n k dri wdri n k t ri wt ri i i i all senses are identied by wordnet sense index title suppressed due to excessive length fig
mr summarization algorithm mrsa ef is the weight of the kth entity frame v and n k where w k case role relations of type i in of the kth entity frame
similarly n k t ri are the number of domain relations temporal relations of type i in fk respectively
wcri wdri and wt ri are the constant weights assigned to caserole domain and time relations of type i gure
is the number of and n k dri cri on the other hand we assume that an action frame is important if its is nected to important frames
hence the weight of each action frame updated by its neighbors see equation
w k af rcri crij rdri drij rt ri t rij i j i j i j where w k af is the weight of action frame k rcri denes the weight of the case role of type i gure
is the weight of the jth frame connected to frame with caserole of type i
similarly rt ri and rdri are the corresponding ratios for temporal and domain relations while are the corresponding weights of frames related to frame with temporal and domain relations respectively
and drij crij t rij

weight based partitioning the entity frame weights obtained from the weight assignment are partitioned into clusters using k which has an advantage of the initial seeding of the cluster centers
k provides a way to avoid producing poor clustering which is more likely to happen by the standard k means algorithm
the rst cluster center is chosen uniformly at random as one of the data points then each subsequent cluster center is chosen from the remaining data points with probability proportional to its squared distance from the point s closest existing cluster center
we used the method in to select the best k with maximum ratio between the intra cluster distance measure intra and is the inter cluster distance measure inter as illustrated in equation
m elhoseiny et al
intra inter zj i j n k xci where zi and zj are centers of clusters i and j respectively and ci is the set of points that belong to cluster i
having performed the clustering we select the cluster of frames of the highest center as the main frames


concept based partitioning the objective of this step is to group semantically related frames under one common concept according to the ontology i
e
abstraction
the associated actions of each main entity frame extracted from the top cluster of the weight based partitioning are passed through the concept based partitioning and a list of concepts with their corresponding frames is returned
if an action frame of a main entity frame was not grouped with any of the other action frames the associated entity frames of that action frame are grouped using concept based partitioning
so the new summarized meaning representation contains the main entity frames the grouped concepts associated with them as new action frames the ungrouped action frames around the main entity frames and the grouped concepts of entity frames around them as new entity frames
the following steps illustrates how to conceptually partition concepts around each main entity frame

group frames of the exact concept i
e
ontological distance

merge two frames whose concepts has the shortest path in the ontology

repeat step until the count of the groups gth we used
the bottom up manner of our conceptual grouping algorithm behaves as a variant of agglomerative hierarchical clustering
the algorithm mainly analyzes the selected and its neighbors and try to do conceptual partitioning if convenient as lustrated in gure for einstein and gure for shakespeare
the advantage of this model is that each high level frame could be expanded into details the dmr gions
the highest level of groups serves as the abstracted meaning representation
the dmr region for each abstracted frame is generated by including all the frames that are descendants of the given group frame following the agglomerative cal clusters
in shakespeare s example shakespeare as a main entity frame is detected by the weight assignment and partitioning steps
afterwards shakespeare s actions are grouped conceptually using our conceptual based partitioning through the ontology
for instance action frames of earn living wrote good plays and is great literature are grouped under work concept in the ontology
while action frames of lived in strateford born in and had children are grouped under life personal life concept
from this example it is intuitive that conceptual tioning is done in a bottom up manner which is adopted in our algorithm
hence it takes only recursive calls in these examples
in general the algorithm recursive calls depend on the ontology and the number of concepts in the given instance

einstein multi level mindmaps
interactive mlmr generation mlmr generation could be also interactive as follows
firstly the dmr is marized by mrsa
the summarized mr is then passed to mindmap generation detailed in the next section to pictorially visualize the most abstract level of the mindmap
the user then can interacts with the generated mindmaps by selecting one of the group frames which triggers running msra for the subset of dmr ferred by the group frame
the mindmap generation then visualizes the output mr which represents the details of the selected group frame
the same process could be repeated interactively until the most detailed level is reached
previous steps could be stored to allow going back to parent levels and down to the detailed levels
in this interactive mode the generation is also effective since only the top level need to be computed and group frames are detailed based on the interactions by the user
mindmap generation in the mindmap generation step an arbitrary meaning representation is converted into a mindmap that contains images for visual frames and dynamically allocate them on the screen
visual frames are determined by checking whether the frame s m elhoseiny et al
concept is visual in the ontology
then a query text is generated for each visual frame to retrieve a relevant image from google image search

query generation and image web retrieval we propose two approaches to generate the query
in the rst approach the given frame name is associated with its lled attributes
for instance if there exist an entity frame ball red size small the generated query will be small red ball
on the other hand the second approach involves frame combination
for example if we have a sentence like shakespeare performed before the queen in december
if the queen is web searched as suggested by the rst approach an irrelevant image will likely be retrieved
however if the query combines shakespeare and queen
the query is more likely to return a picture of queen elizabeth which is meant by this sentence
that is why we tried to combine frames in the query
we implemented the second approach as follows
given frame i we add to the query generated by the rst approach the name of within two edges from frame i i
e
relevant frame
however we add the names of the frames only if it is signicantly more important
in other words relative weight of frame i should be high with respect to frame j
mathematically speaking w fi where w fi is the weight of frame w fj i w fj is weight of frame j th is the relative importance threshold in our experiments
finally the images displayed in the generated mindmap are retrieved using google image search gois
we used the gois api to retrieve the relevant images using the generated query and the rst image in the results is chosen

automatic layout allocation a graph drawing algorithm must take into account aesthetics criteria for making salient characteristics of the graph easily readable
some aesthetic criteria include minimizing number of edge crossings maintaining straight edges as possible maximize display symmetry
in our work we achieved an acceptable layout by adopting the spring model by thomas kamps et al in
spring model meets two aesthetic principles
first all edges are prefered to have the same length
second the out should be symmetric as possible
the main idea is to model the cost function by attaching a spring between the edges of the desired length as in equation
n e yi ij xi yi where xi yi is the location of the the node i
lij is the desired length between node i and node j it is not necessary to have an edge between node i and node j
there are four parameters that we designed while adopting the spring model l other third party commercial tools methods could be used also here e

microsoft agl
microsoft
com en us projects title suppressed due to excessive length ddij which is the desired length of directly connected nodes we set l to
d which is the diameter of the drawing i
e
the maximum distance between a pair of nodes in our system we set d to
lij l if there is an edge between node i and minl where dlm is the length of the shortest path node j
otherwise lij between node l and node m
in our system all pairs shortest paths are computed between every pair of nodes using floyd warshall algorithm
kij is the weight assigned for the cost function between node i and node j which indicate the strength of the spring associate between node i and j
kij where d ij dij if there is d ij no edge between node i and node j d ij l otherwise
this indicates less restrictive springs when nodes are not directly connected
while nodes are assumed to be points in each node i in our setting is a rectangular area ri of width wi and height hi centered around the node position xi yi
for instance ri will be the size of the image to be rendered if node i is associated with an image
to tackle this problem we add to each lij where mk is the diameter of rectangle rk of node k
the rationale behind adding is that when the distance between the centers of two rectangles is the rectangles does not intersect regardless their positions
finally the gradient of the cost function is computed and used to nd a local minimum
we used random re initialization strategy to reach a good solution minimizing equation
we run the spring model times with different initial seeds selected randomly on the screen and the layout with the minimum cost is selected
experimental results this section presents the evaluation methodology and experiments of our mindmap automation framework
the evaluation was based on mechanical turk mturk rating responses with different system parameters
as indicated in mturk users have less than of the workers have no high school degree and average education years of

in order to improve the quality of the responses the workers were exposed to illustrative examples before getting introduced to the instances used for the evaluation
furthermore we also required that the mturk workers have at least a approval rate and approved assignments to work on our experiments
the following subsections details the evaluation dataset three experiments to ate different aspects of our framework

historical figures dataset and evaluation metrics since there is no existing datasets to evaluate mindmap visualization we created our own dataset to validate our framework
we chose articles of historical figures e

shakespeare george washington to build our dataset
historical ures were chosen from the bbc historical gures section of size between words to words
we used our framework to generate different mindmaps this is based on their previous history that is maintained in mturk system m elhoseiny et al

the four hundred and mindmaps indicates that thirteen mindmaps were generated for each article one for each rameter setting detailed in this section
the four hundred and cases were evaluated based on human subject rankings by mturk workers responses on the following ve question survey

how many repeated entities actions are there in the shown diagram if no repeated entities actions please put our evaluation is partitioned into three experiments to evaluate the effect of ing the system parameters
the framework was evaluated upon three main variations
gois parameters size image type for single level mindmap in experiment concept combination in experiment c multilevel mindmaps in experiment
the responses of the experiments were evaluated based on three metrics mean standard deviation to indicate the stability of the response and for grading questions i
e
satisfaction ratio sr that is dened as sr of responses of responses
appendix a shows the generated single level and multilevel mindmaps for tan van gokh george washington and newton a subset of the evaluated outputs gures and
more automatically generated mindmaps are attached in the supplementary materials
while the framework can allow the user to change the retrieved images we only evaluate results with images automatically retrieved by our method

experiment cases responses in experiment we evaluate the mturk workers satisfaction with single level mindmaps and test whether their responses are biased by varying the displayed image parameters
we tested nine variations three different image types all any image clipart lineart and three sizes all auto small
the auto size is a size mode we implemented to determine the image size according to the weight of the frame to be visualized computed in subsection


our implementation uses medium size image biggest suitable size for mindmaps if the number of relations to it is greater than six otherwise the system uses small image size
the mindmap generation phase in this experiment did not involve concept combination which is evaluated in experiment
overall we have cases with ten mturk responses each i

mean stddev sr mean stddev sr mean stddev sr and are the most relevant questions to the appearance of the generated mindmap and the generated images
the results of these questions are grouped for each of the nine variations in this experiment
figure shows the three evaluation metrics for the nine cases on and which indicates that changing the image type or size almost does not affect the responses of the mturk workers
in other words these responses were not biased to specic image type or size

experiment responses experiment focuses on evaluating the user satisfaction of the mindmaps in case of concept combination mode described in subsection

to evaluate whether the mturk workers were biased to the pictures we created concept combination cases with three variations of image types resulting in cases historical gures
each case was evaluated by ten different mturk anonymous workers responses
table middle part shows summarized results for the experiment
compared to experiment there is an improvement of in the mean and in the satisfaction ratio for with the use of concept combination
however the satisfaction ratio of pictures satisfaction decreased by
this indicates that the retrieved image using direct query is relatively better than retrieved image using concept tion query
the results were also grouped by the three variations of experiment which indicate a similar behavior to experiment
e
no bias
it is important to mention that the relevance of the mindmap images currently depends only on the quality of the rstly ranked image retrieved by our generated query from gois
after careful look on the mturk responses and our own tion of this experiment we found that most of the retrieved images are relevant using direct queries
however in some cases it does not retrieve a relevant image
for example new capital node in akhentan example is assigned to an unsatisfactory image see gure in appendix a
our intuition is that context information is not considered in this retrieved images in direct query mode which we tried to model by concept combination cc queries
having applied cc mode to akhentan example we managed to retrieve an image of a pharaonic land for this new capital query which is more relevant
however the cc mode negatively affected the overall formance of remaining queries since it badly affects most of the remaining frames as illustrated in the results of this experiment

experiment responses the purpose of this experiment is mainly to rate the partitioning of the information in the multilevel mindmaps and not the evaluation of the retrieved images evaluated in experiment and
hence we selected one case for each historical gure with the best images retrieved in experiment
was changed to evaluate of conceptual grouping instead of the pictures as they was already evaluated in experiments and title suppressed due to excessive length
question became to what extent are you satised with the structure of the multi level mindmap grade
to evaluate it interactively we have generated interactive ash les one for each historical gure
each ash le was evaluated by twenty mturk users i

there is
and improvement in the mean and sr respectively compared to the single level mindmaps
the sults show the satisfaction of the users with the hierarchical representation of the mindmap
while both single level and multilevel approaches give satisfactory puts the multilevel approach is the only way to represent all information in large text where single level generation is not applicable
in order to give a careful consideration to the criticism of the generated multilevel mindmaps we computed the lowest for all the ratings for and
we also computed the lowest percentile for the ratings of each of the historical gures and we reported the average overall the historical gures see table
we further investigated the highest errors reported by the mturk workers in response to and which indicate missing actions entities or redundancy of any of them
for each of historical gure we select the responses that have non zero values for and
then we compute the average over all the historical gures see table
table experiment worst percentile and the rst row shows the percentile over the all responses while the second row shows the mean of the average of the for each of historical gure mean of percentile worst responses mean of the average percentile for each historical gures

table the average of the non zero responses mean of and for each historical gure in experiment average of non zero responses


however this group of responses does not indicate high disagreement with the generated mindmaps as indicated in tables and we carefully investigated the provided comments by the human subjects on the three experiments
we noticed that the main criticism of the least satised subjects was due to some missing redundant pieces of information and irrelevant images in the mindmap
while the experiments clarication information included in the correct class e
work personal life and political life
as an incorrect instance information like the historical gure s birth or death is classied under work
this clarication was exposed to the mturk workers with examples and our investigation indicate that these cases are few it is an important feedback to consider for our future work in which targets generalization on larger scales
discussion and conclusion our framework has multiple limitations
for instance it depends on the quality of the syntactic analyzer to pass information
if a statement could not be parsed then it will be ignored and its information will not be included in the generated mindmap accordingly
another limitation is that the mlmr algorithm assumes that there is a central idea of a given document which is valid for the historical gures dataset but not valid in general
in the future we aim at exploring different methods to erate hierarchy of abstract information in the text and use word vectors e

to help semantically related information that might not be captured by the ogy
we aim to extend the system such that it is reliable in handling very large text e

a book
furthermore we will gate different approaches to retrieve more evant images from the textual query
in order to generate mindmaps for a large in a sonable time the framework computational time needs to be signicantly reduced
for stance multi level mindmap generation of a word document take about seconds on a
gb machine see gure
the recorded time is the average time to vert raw text to multilevel mindmap ing automatic layout allocation
finally rather than restricting our domain to historical gures in this work we plan to investigate the generalization of mindmap visualization for any text and tackle ontology related problems
