v i x r a chapter on deformations of n lie algebras abdenacer makhlouf abstract t he aim of this paper is to review the deformation theory of n lie algebras
we summarize the parameter formal deformation theory and provide a generalized approach using any unital commutative associative algebra as a deformation base
moreover we discuss degenerations and quantization of n lie algebras
introduction the purpose of this paper is to provide a survey on deformations of n lie algebras
deformation is one of the oldest techniques used by mathematicians and cists
the rst instances of the so called deformation theory were given by kodaira and spencer for complex structures and by gerstenhaber for associative algebras
abstract deformation theory and deformation functors in algebraic geometry were inspired and developed in the works of andre deligne goldman grothendick lusie laudal lichtenbaum milson quillen schlessinger and stasheff
among concrete deformation theory developed by gerstenhaber for associative algebras and later with schack for bialgebras the lie algebras case was studied by huis and richardson and then by fialowski and her collaborators in a more general framework
deformations of n ary algebras was considered in several papers
formation theory is the study of a family in the neighborhood of a given element
intuitively a deformation of a mathematical object is a family of the same kind of objects depending on some parameters
the main and popular tool is the power series ring or more generally any commutative algebras
by standard facts of formation theory the innitesimal deformations of an algebra of a given type are parametrized by a second cohomology of the algebra
more generally it is stated universite haute alsace laboratoire de mathematiques informatique et applications mulhouse france e mail abdenacer

fr abdenacer makhlouf that deformations are controlled by a suitable cohomology
deformations help to construct new objects starting from a given object and to infer some of its ties
they can also be useful for classication problems
a modern approach sentially due to quillen deligne drinfeld and kontsevich is that in characteristic zero every deformation problem is controlled by a differential graded lie algebra via solutions of maurer cartan equation modulo gauge equivalence
some matical formulations of quantization are based on the algebra of observables and consist in replacing the classical algebra of observables typically complex valued smooth functions on a poisson manifold by a noncommutative one constructed by means of an algebraic formal deformations of the classical algebra
in sevich solved a longstanding problem in mathematical physics that is every poisson manifold admits formal quantization which is canonical up to a certain equivalence
deformation theory has been applied as a useful tool in the study of many other mathematical structures in lie theory quantum groups operads and so on
even today it plays an important role in many developments of contemporary ics especially in representation theory
the n ary algebraic structures which are natural generalizations of binary erations appeared naturally in various domains of theoretical and mathematical physics
indeed theoretical physics progress of quantum mechanics and the ery of the nambu mechanics see as well as a work of s
okubo on yang baxter equation gave impulse to a signicant development on n ary algebras
the n ary operations appeared rst through cubic matrices which were introduced in the nineteenth century by cayley
the cubic matrices were considered again and generalized by kapranov gelfand zelevinskii in see and sokolov in see
another recent motivation to study n ary operation comes for string theory and m branes where appeared naturally a so called bagger lambert bra algebra involving a ternary operation
hundred of papers are dedicated to bagger lambert algebra
for other physical applications see
the rst conceptual generalization of binary algebras was the ternary algebras introduced by jacobson in connection with problems from jordan theory and quantum mechanics he dened the lie triple systems
a lie triple system consists of a space of linear operators on vector space v that is closed under the ternary bracket y where xy yx
equivalently the lie triple tem may be viewed as a subspace of the lie algebra closed relative to the ternary product
a lie triple system arose also in the study of symmetric spaces
more generally we distinguish two kinds of generalization of binary lie algebras
firstly n ary lie algebras in which the jacobi identity is generalized by considering a cyclic summation over instead of see and secondly n ary nambu gebras in which the fundamental identity generalizes the fact that the adjoint maps are derivations
the corresponding identity is called fundamental identity and it peared rst in nambu mechanics the abstract denition of n ary nambu bras or n lie algebras when the bracket is skew symmetric was given by fillipov in see and for the algebraic formulation of the nambu mechanics
the leibniz n ary algebras were introduced and studied in
on deformations of n lie algebras this article is organized as follows
in the rst section we summarize the tions of n ary algebras of lie type and associative type and provide some classical examples
moreover we discuss the representations of n lie algebras
in the ond section we review homological algebra tools and dene the cohomology for n lie algebra that suits with deformation theory
the third section is dedicated to one parameter formal deformations based on formal power series
we also describe the case where the parameter no longer commutes with the original algebra
in tion we present a more general approach based on any commutative associative algebra generalizing to n lie algebras the approach developed by fialowski and her collaborators for lie algebras
section deals with algebraic varieties of n lie algebras and degenerations
in the last section we discuss n lie poisson algebras and quantization

denitions and examples of n lie algebras and other types of n ary algebras throughout this paper k is a eld of characteristic zero and n is a k vector space


n lie algebras in this section we provide basics on n lie algebras which are also called filippov n ary algebras or nambu lie algebras
denition
an n lie algebra is a pair n


consisting of a vector space n and an n linear map n n n satisfying


xn


xn






and xs xs xn s sn and xn n
where sn stands for the permutation group on n elements and denotes the signature of s
we call condition
nambu identity it is also called fundamental identity or filippov identity
remark
let n


be an n lie algebra
let


n and y n
let lx be a linear map on n dened by

abdenacer makhlouf then the nambu identity maybe written


xn






n let n m and n n be two n ary operations m n n n n
we dene a operation m n by m n


xn


m


n xn


n m xn


n xi





then an n ary operation m on a vector space n satises nambu identity if and only if m m
morphisms of n lie algebras are dened as follows
denition
let n


and n


be two n lie algebras
a linear map r n n is an n lie algebras morphism if it satises r i n
example
the polynomial algebra of variables with the bracket dened by the functional jacobian d d d d d d d d d d d d d is a lie algebra
we have also this fundamental example
example
let v be the dimensional oriented euclidian space over r
the bracket of vectors is given by with respect to orthonormal basis where


are the coordinates of er
then v


is a lie algebra
remark
every lie algebra on could be deduced from the previous example see
on deformations of n lie algebras

n ary algebras of associative type there are several possible generalizations of binary associative algebras
a typical example is the ternary product of rectangular matrices introduced by hestenes dened for a b c mn m by where b is the conjugate transpose
consider an n ary operation n n n or m n n
the n ary operation is said to be symmetric resp
skew symmetric if xs n xn s sn and xn n
resp
xs n xn s sn and xn n
where denotes the signature of the permutation s sn
it is said to be commutative if xs n xn n

s sn remark
a symmetric ternary operation is commutative
we have the following type of associative ternary operations
denition
a totally associative n ary algebra is given by a k vector space n and an n ary operation m satisfying for all n i
example
let be a basis of a dimensional space n the ternary operation on n given by denes a totally associative ternary algebra
denition
a weak totally associative n ary algebra is given by a k vector space n and a ternary operation m satisfying for all n xn
naturally any totally associative n ary algebra is a weak totally associative n ary algebra
abdenacer makhlouf denition
a partially associative n ary algebra is given by a k vector space n and an n ary operation m satisfying for all n xi
example
let be a basis of a dimensional space n the ternary operation on n given by denes a partially associative ternary algebra
remark
let n be a bilinear associative algebra
then the n ary operation dened by


xn determines on the vector space n a structure of totally associative n ary algebra which is not partially associative
the category of totally resp
partially n ary algebras is encoded by symmetric operad denoted resp

the space on p ary non symmetric operations of is given by p otherwise
if we put the degree k on the generating operation of then the non symmetric operads and are koszul dual to each other
moreoever the koszulity can be proved by the rewriting method
k there is another generalization of jacobi condition that leads to another type of n ary lie algebra
denition
an n ary lie algebras is a skew symmetric n ary operation on a k vector space n satisfying n the following generalized jacobi condition xs xs xs xn xs
s as in the binary case there is a functor which makes correspondence to any partially associative n ary algebra an n ary lie algebra see
proposition
to any partially associative n ary algebra on a vector space n with n ary operation m one associates an n ary lie algebra on n dened xn n by the bracket xn s xs n

representations of n lie algebras in this section we consider adjoint representations of n lie algebras and show that any n lie algebra can be represented by a leibniz algebra
on deformations of n lie algebras denition
a representation of an n lie algebra n


on a vector space n is a skew symmetric multilinear map r satisfying for y n the identity r y r y r






where is an endomorphism of n
two representations r and r on n are equivalent if there exists n n an isomorphism of vector space such that y f where y r and y r for n and y n
example
let n


be an n lie algebra
the map ad dened in
is a representation
the identity
is equivalent to nambu identity
it is called adjoint representation
leibniz algebras were introduced by loday
a leibniz algebra is a pair a a consisting of a vector space a a bilinear map a a a satisfying for y a

let n


be an n lie algebras and be the set of elements


that are skew symmetric in their arguments
we denote by l n the space and call it the fundamental set
let


y


n
let l be a linear map dened as



and extending it linearly to all elements of
notice that
we dene a bilinear map by lemma
the map l satises y







z z
for all y l n n
proposition
the pair l n is a leibniz algebra
proof
straightforward verication see
we obtain a similar result if we consider the space t n instead of l n
abdenacer makhlouf

central extensions we racall some basics about extensions of n lie algebras
denition
let a b c be three n lie algebras n
an extension of b by a is a short sequence l c m b a such that l i m l ker m
we say also that c is an extension of b by a
is an injective homomorphism m is a surjective homomorphism and denition
let a b be two n lie algebras and a by a
l c m b be an extension of b the extension is said to be trivial if there exists an ideal i of c such that c ker m i
it is said to be central if ker m
we may equivalently dene central extensions by a dimensional algebra we will simply call it central extension this way denition
let n be an n lie algebra
we call central extension of n the space n kc equipped with the bracket





xn w


xn c and





xn n where w identity or jacobi identity for n
is a skew symmetric n linear form such that


c satises the nambu proposition

the bracket of a central extension satises the nambu identity if and only if w is a cocycle for the scalar cohomology of n lie algebras

two central extensions of an n lie algebra a given by two maps w and w are isomorphic if and only if w w is a coboundary for the scalar cohomology of n lie algebras

deformation cohomology of n lie algebras the basic concepts of homological algebra are those of a complex and phisms of complexes dening the category of complexes see for example
a chain complex c
is a sequence c of abelian groups or more ally objects of an abelian category and an indexed set d of phisms d cp such that d d for all p
a chain complex can be considered as a cochain complex by reversing the enumeration c cp and on deformations of n lie algebras d d p
a cochain complex c is a sequence of abelian groups and with the property d d for all p
the phisms homomorphisms d p are called coboundary operators or codifferentials
a ogy of a cochain complex c is given by the groups h kerd p imd
c d c p d the elements of c p are p cochains the elements of z p kerd p are p cocycles the elements of bp imd are p coboundaries
because d d for all we have bp z p c p for all p
the pth cohomology group is the quotient h p z p bp
the cohomology of n lie algebras is induced by the cohomology of leibniz algebras
let n


be an n lie algebra and the pair l n n be the leibniz algebra associated to n where the bracket is dened in

theorem
let n


be an n lie algebra
let c n n n n for p be the cochains set and d c n c n l n be the linear map dened for p by dj j xi and for p by dj j xi where a j j for n lie algebras such that d d d d
j
then there exists a cohomology complex c n the coboundary map d c n c n is dened for j c n by


ap z


ai


a ai a j


z


ai


z y


ap b where y

ap

ap xi


for element ai l n n
in particular for p we get the set of cocycles j abdenacer makhlouf n n n n satisfying where for and y y xi y y z
y z y xi

for p y n n and xn n n we have xn xn y xn
n notice that a linear map y n n such that is a cocycle and it corresponds to a derivation of the n lie algebra
the set of coboundaries is dened as n n n n j n n such that d
hence the second cohomology group which plays an important role in deformation theory is dened as n n n

formal deformation of n lie algebras in this section we study one parameter formal deformations of n lie algebras
this approach were introduced by gerstenhaber for associative and by nijenhuis and richardson for lie
since then the approach were extended to many other algebraic structures
the main results connect formal deformation to cohomology groups
the noncommutative case was studied by pincson


one parameter formal deformation of n lie algebras let be the power series ring in one variable t and coefcients in k and n be the set of formal series whose coefcients are elements of the vector space n n is obtained by extending the coefcients domain of n from k to
given a k n linear map j n

let n


be an n lie algebra
a one parameter formal mation of the n lie algebra n is given by a linear map


n


n n of the form


t ti

i is a skew symmetric n linear map


i n


n n extended to a linear map and





such that for


xn

the deformation is said to be of order if

n n y this identity may be viewed as the cocycle condition d



dened in

more generally let n m and n n be two n ary operations m n n n n
we dene a operation m n by abdenacer makhlouf m n


xn

n xn



m xn


n xi



then an n ary operation m on a vector space n satises nambu identity if and only if m m
therefore the nambu identity
is equivalent to an innite system called deformation equation

for an arbitrary k the kth equation of the previous system may be written

the cated deformation is extended to a deformation of order m if

the right hand side of this equation is called the obstruction to nd


m tending the deformation
it turns out that the obstruction is a cocycle
then if n n it lows that all obstructions vanish and every


m n n is integrable
in the following we characterize equivalent and trivial deformations
denition
let n

given two deformations nt n


t and n ti

t t n

and






we say that nt and t are equivalent if there exists a formal automorphism f t n n that iti where i and i d such that n may be written in the form t i with





f t t t xn t

a deformation nt of n is said to be trivial if nt is equivalent to n viewed as an n ary algebra on n

t the proof is similar to the case n


noncommutative one parameter formal deformations in previous formal deformation theory the parameter commutes with the original algebra
motivated by some nonclassical deformation appearing in quantization of nambu mechanics pinczon introduced a deformation called noncommutative formation where the parameter no longer commutes with the original algebra
he developed also the associated cohomology
let n be a k vector space and s be an endomorphism of n
we give n a structure dened for every ap a l q k by apt p l qtq l qapt p l apt l qs
p denition
a s of an n ary algebra n is a k algebra structure on n which is compatible with the previous structure and such that n a
a generalization of these deformations was proposed by f
nadaud where he considered deformations based on two commuting endomorphisms s and t
the structure on n is dened for a n by the formulas a s and a t t a t being the right action of t on a
the remarquable difference with commutative deformation is that the weyl gebra of differential operators with polynomial coefcients over r is rigid for mutative deformations but has a nontrivial noncommutative deformation it is given by the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra
abdenacer makhlouf
global deformations this approach follows from a general fact in schlessinger s works and was veloped by a
fialowski and her collaborators for different kind of algebras lie algebra leibniz algebras




in the sequel we extend this proach to n lie algebras
let b be a commutative algebra over a eld k of teristic and an augmentation morphism e a k a k algebra homomorphism e
we set me me is a maximal ideal of b
a maximal ideal m of b such that a k denes naturally an augmentation
we call b m base of deformation
denition
a global deformation of base b m of an n lie algebra n


is a structure of b algebra on the tensor product b k n n with a bracket

we deduce


xn a i zi with a i m zi n

two deformations of an n lie algebra with the same base are called equivalent or isomorphic if there exists an algebra isomorphism between the two copies of b k n compatible with e i d
a global deformation with base b m is called local if b is a local k with a unique maximal ideal mb
if in addition the deformation is called innitesimal
let b be another commutative algebra over k with augmentation e b k and f b b an algebra homomorphism such that f and e f e

then m xn f a zi i i with a i m zi n
one may address the problem of nding for a xed algebra particular tions which induces all the others in the space of all deformations moduli space or in a xed category of deformations
the problem of constructing universal or versal deformations of lie algebras was considered for the categories of deformations over innitesimal local algebras and complete local algebras see
they show that if we consider the innitesimal deformations i
e
the deformations over local algebras b such that b where mb is the maximal ideal then there ists a universal deformation the morphism between base algebras is unique
if we consider the category of complete local rings then there does not exist a universal deformation but only versal deformation there is no unicity for the morphism
let b be a complete local algebra over k so b limit where m is the maximal ideal of b and we assume that b m k
a formal global deformation of n with base b m is an algebra structure on limn b mn n such that e i d the completed tensor product b n n k n n is an algebra homomorphism
the formal global deformation of n with base are the same as b limn b mn inductive formal one parameter deformation of gerstenhaber

the algebraic varieties l ien m and degenerations let n be an m dimensional vector space over k and em be a basis of n
an n linear bracket


can be dened by specifying the structure constants ck in k where


eim ck in ek
m the nambu identity and skew symmetry limits the sets of structure constants ck m
it is ated by the polynomial relations to a subvariety of which we denote by l ien in m ck jncs ck jrcs
n m s m
abdenacer makhlouf therefore l ien m carries a structure of algebraic variety which is quadratic non regular and in general non reduced
the natural action of the group sponds to the change of basis two n lie algebras n


and n


are isomorphic if there exists in such that that is xn n






the orbit of an n lie algebra n


denoted by j is the set of all its isomorphic n lie algebras
in a point in l ien m is dened by m n parameters which are the structure constants ck satisfying

the orbits are in correspondence with the isomorphism classes of m dimensional n lie algebras
the stabilizer group of stab glm k is aut the automorphism group of
the orbit j is identied with the homogeneous space glm k
then dim j dimaut
the orbit j is provided when k c a complex eld with the structure of a differentiable manifold
in fact j is the image through the action of the lie group glm k of the point considered as a point of hom n n n
the m at the point corresponds to n and the zariski tangent space to l ien tangent space to the orbit corresponds to n
the rst approach to study varieties l ien m is to establish classications of n lie algebras up to isomorphisms for a xed dimension
classication of n lie algebras of dimension less than or equal to is known see
we have the following results
theorem
any n lie algebra n of dimension less than or equal to n is isomorphic to one of the following n ary algebras omitted brackets are either obtained by skew symmetry or

the second approach to study the algebraic variety l ien m is to describe its ducible components
this problem was considered for binary lie algebras of small dimensions but it is still open for n lie algebras
the main approach uses formal deformations and degenerations
a degeneration notion is a sort of dual notion of a deformation
it appeared rst in physics literature inonu and wigner
degeneration is also called specialisation or contraction
we provide rst the metric denition of a degeneration using zariski topology
denition
let n


and n


be two m dimensional n lie algebras
we said that is a degeneration of if belongs to the closure of the orbit of in l ien m j
therefore and are in the same irreducible component
a characterization of degeneration for lie algebras in the global deformations viewpoint was given by grunewald and ohalloran in
it generalizes naturally to n lie as follows
theorem
let and be two m dimensional n lie algebras over k with brackets


and



the n lie algebra is a degeneration of if and only if there is a discrete valuation k algebra b with residue eld k whose quotient eld k is nitely generated over k of transcendence degree one one rameter and there is an m dimensional n lie algebra


b over b such that


b k


k and


b k



we call such a degeneration a global degeneration
a formal degeneration is dened as follows
denition
let n


be an m dimensional n lie algebra
let t be a parameter in k and ft be a continuous family of invertible linear maps on n over k
the limit when it exists of a sequence ft ft is a mal degeneration of in the sense that is in the zariski closure of the set ft
the bracket


is given by xn n


lim t ft


ft
we have the following observations

the bracket


t t when t tends to the condition remains satised



ft ft satises nambu identity
thus
the linear map ft is invertible when t and may be singular when t
then we may obtain by degeneration a new n lie algebra
on deformations of n lie algebras
the denition of formal degeneration may be extended naturally to innite mensional case

when k is the complex eld the multiplication given by the limit follows from a limit of the structure constants using the metric topology
in fact


corresponds to a change of basis when t
when t they give eventually a new point in l ien m

if ft is dened by a power serie the images of ft n are in general in the laurent
but when the degeneration exists it lies in the t power series ring n power series ring n

every formal degeneration is a global degeneration
remark
rigid n lie algebras will have a special interest an open orbit of a given n lie algebra is dense in the irreducible component in which it lies
then its zariski closure determines an irreducible component of l ien m i
e
all n lie algebras in this irreducible component are degenerations of the rigid n lie algebra and there is no n lie algebra which degenerates to the rigid n lie algebra
two non isomorphic rigid n lie algebras correspond to different irreducible components
so the number of rigid n lie algebra classes gives a lower bound of the number of irreducible components of l ien m
note that not all irreducible components are zariski closure of open orbits

n lie poisson algebras and quantization

n lie poisson algebras we introduce the notion of n lie poisson algebra
denition
an n lie poisson algebra is a triple n m


consisting of a k vector space n a bilinear map m n n n and an n ary bracket


such that
n m is a binary commutative associative algebra
n


is a n lie algebra
the following leibniz rule



m xn m xn


m



xn holds for all


n
a morphism of n lie poisson algebras is a linear map that is a morphism of the underlying n lie algebras and associative algebras
example
let c be the algebra of c functions on and the dinates on
we dene the ternary brackets as in
then c


is a ternary lie algebra
in addition the bracket satises the leibniz rule g abdenacer makhlouf g where g c and the multiplication being the pointwise multiplication that is f
therefore the algebra is a lie poisson algebra
this algebra was considered already in by nambu as a possibility of tending the poisson bracket of standard hamiltonian mechanics to bracket of three functions dened by the jacobian
clearly the nambu bracket may be generalized further to an n lie poisson allowing for an arbitrary number of entries


quantization of nambu mechanics the quantization problem of nambu mechanics was investigated by dito flato sternheimer and takhtajan see also
let m be an m dimensional c and a be the algebra of smooth real valued functions on m
assume that a carries a structure of n lie poisson structure where the tative associative multiplication is the pointwise multiplication
the skew symmetry of the nambu bracket and the leibniz identity imply that there exists an n vector eld h on m such that



fn h


fn



fn a

an n vector eld is called a nambu tensor if its associated nambu bracket dened by
satises the nambu identity

denition
a nambu poisson manifold m h is a manifold m on which is ned a nambu tensor h
then m is said to be endowed with a nambu poisson structure
the dynamics associated with a nambu bracket on m is specied by n tonians


a and the time evolution of f a is given by d dt




then a is called an integral of motion for the system dened by
if it satises



poisson manifolds it follows from the nambu identity that a poisson like theorem exists for theorem
the nambu bracket of n integrals of motion is also an integral of tion
it turns out that a direct application of deformation quantization to son structures is not possible a solution to the quantization problem was presented in the approach of zariski quantization of elds observables functions in this case on deformations of n lie algebras polynomials
instead of looking at the deformed nambu bracket as some symmetrized form of an n linear product the nambu bracket is deformed directly
in the case of previous example the usual jacobian bracket is replaced by any n ary bracket having the preceding properties we get a modied jacobian which is still a nambu bracket
that is to say the modied jacobian is symmetric it satises the leibniz rule with respect to the new bracket and the nambu identity is veried
the deformed bracket is given by s e s xs xs xs where is the permutation group of and e s is the signature
in this approach the whole problem of quantizing nambu poisson structure reduces to the construction of the deformed product
a non trivial abelian deformation of the algebra of polynomials on rm does nt exist because of the vanishing of the ond harrison cohomology group
nevertheless it is possible to construct an abelian associative deformation of the usual pointwise product of the following form b g t g
where maps a real polynomial on to the symmetric algebra constructed over the polynomials on a
t is an evaluation map which allows to go back to deformed polynomials t a
it replaces the symmetric tensor product by a symmetrized form of a partial moyal product on moyal product on a hyperplane in with deformation rameter t
the extension of the map to deformed polynomials by requiring that it annihilates non zero powers of t will give rise to an abelian deformation of the usual product t restores a t dependence
in general
does not dene an associative product and we look for a b which makes the product b associative


ternary virasoro witt algebras curtright fairlie and zachos provided the following ternary q virasoro witt bras constructed through the use of enveloping algebra techniques
denition
the ternary algebras dened on the linear space vw generated by qn and the skewsymmetric ternary brackets qk qm qn k qk qm rn k qk rm rn n rk rm rn



abdenacer makhlouf is called ternary virasoro witt algebras
actually the previous ternary algebra is a ternary nambu lie algebra only in the cases
t
a
larsson showed in that the above ternary virasoro witt algebras can be constructed by applying to the virasoro representation acting scalar densities i
e
primary elds the ternary commutator bracket y z
z y z y where the dot denotes the associative multiplication and the binary commutator bracket of its corresponding lie algebra
he considered the operators em emx lm l m sm l dx which lead to the binary commutators lm n em lm
therefore one obtains the ternary brackets lk lm l l lk lm m lk em m ek em en



the brackets involving s s are not needed to recover the ternary virasoro witt bras
the brackets

are obtained by taking lm l qk em l l p p naturally these ternary algebras are lie algebras only for l
p l l
remark
one may notice that the ternary commutator
does not lead matically to ternary nambu lie algebra when starting from an associative algebra and the corresponding lie algebra given by the binary commutators
see and for triple commutator leading to lie algebras and ternary hom nambu lie algebras
more general construction of n algebras induced by n lie algebras was studied in on deformations of n lie algebras references
