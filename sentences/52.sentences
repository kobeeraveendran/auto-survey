this text summarizes these ndings
it focuses on the simplest but most physically relevant case we could treat so far namely that of the defocusing cubic nls functional on a interval

from many body quantum mechanics to nonlinear schrodinger theory the nonlinear schrodinger equation is a basic model of quantum optics and condensed matter physics whose analysis has motivated a huge mathematical literature
the tion itself has been originally introduced as a phenomenological model and its derivation from the fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics is a major issue in theoretical and mathematical physics
the advent of bose einstein condensates of ultracold dilute alkali vapors in the has given a renewed impetus to the eld
the nls equation is nowadays thoroughly date july
n
rougerie studied as the basic eective model for the description of such objects
the reason why a one body model such as nls theory can be used to describe a many body system is that in this context all particles reside in the same quantum state this is what is meant by bose einstein condensation
an important line of research has been the rigorous derivation of the equation in a certain limit from the many body schrodinger equation for bosonic particles
this section recalls some background on this topic
the author apologizes for not attempting to do justice to the relevant literature in any exhaustive way the reader is refered to for a more complete introduction to the subject


derivation of ground states
the basic object one starts from is a many body schrodinger hamiltonian say of the form n hn j v xj
wn xi
here v is an external potential felt by the particles and wn a pair interaction potential that n s is most often taken radial
this operator is considered as acting on the space of square integrable symmetric n bosonic wave functions that is of those n n satisfying n n n


xn n


rd of the particles under consideration
for all permutation of the coordinates


xn this symmetry requirement means that we consider bosonic particles which as the name indicates is mandatory to obtain a bose einstein condensate
on a physical level this implies that we consider the atoms of the gas as the basic particles ignoring that they are themselves made of more fundamental objects
this is however as fundamental as one can get for a reasonble description
by ground state we mean the state of lowest possible energy i
e
the eigenfunction of the operator achieving the lowest eigenvalue or equivalently solving the minimization problem for the quadratic form under the constraint that n equilibrium conguration at zero temperature
en n
be normalized
this gives the most stable n hn n i h an important question is the following is it true that at least in some well dened scaling limit the ground of the above hamiltonian resembles a bose einstein condensate the latter is a n wave function of the form n


xn
n
in classical corresponding to putting all the particles in the same quantum state u mechanics this would correspond to assuming independent identically distributed particles i
e
molecular chaos boltzmann s stosszahlansatz
if such an ansatz is valid one naturally obtains a nls like energy functional that u should minimize
indeed inserting in
we nd rd u v u en one usually expects the ansatz
to be valid for large particle number n
in order that the and two body terms in the above functional weigh the same in this limit so that one might hope for a well dened limit it is natural to assume that wn be of order n
at least two possibilities to achieve this should be considered
y z z n n for a xed potential w pick wn n w r kept xed or converging to a constant when n for some
this situation is often called the limit it physically corresponds to having many weak collisions between the particles
the limit functional one obtains is then e v u u rd y
z z i
e
a nonlinear functional with non local nonlinearity often called hartree s functional
z for a xed constant and a xed potential w pick wn n
with as above
this can be called a nls limit
it allows to take the range of the potential as a parameter and to describe a situation where because of diluteness collisions can be rare but quite strong
this happens when d
since n n
w rd w as measures it is natural to expect a true nls functional with local nonlinearity e rd z v u u rd z rd
in the limit
we refer to the literature in particular the previously mentioned reviews and also for results in this direction
under fairly general assumptions one may obtain convergence of the energy per particle n e when n where is the bottom of the spectrum of hn and e the inmum under a unit mass constraint of the relevant limit functional
this serves as a justication for the use of nls functionals to describe the ground states of large bosonic systems
we warn the reader that for relatively large in the nls limit important new aspects emerge and an ansatz
is no longer sucient see as well as and references therein
the most prominent case where these important subtleties occur is when and the n
rougerie so called gross pitaevskii limit
then short range correlations in the ground state have the eect of replacing w by in
where a is the scattering length of w
one can also prove results on sequences of n minimizers showing that in a certain specic sense they are close to factorized states of the form

let us stay vague on this point for the moment and simply warn the reader that in general the wave function n itself is not close to a condensate only its reduced density matrices are
r

derivation of evolution equations
once one knows that ground states of large bosonic systems show bose einstein condensation the next natural question is wether this is preserved by the many body schrodinger dynamics
indeed a typical experimental situation is as follows create a bose einstein condensate by cooling a bose gas to extremely low temperatures so that one may assume that the ground state is reached
the n are then in a stationary state of the hamiltonian hn which is approximately a factorized state un
to probe the dynamics one may then perturb the system most often by changing the one body potential v in
and observe the subsequent evolution
this asks the question of the dynamics of approximately factorized states under the quantum evolution associated to hamiltonians of the form

consider the cauchy problem itn hn n n un
usually this where we stay voluntarily vague on the precise meaning of the symbol means convergence of reduced density matrices the typical result one obtains for ground states
is it true that the solution n t stays approximately factorized n t


xn xj
n after some time evolution in limits similar to those previously mentioned this has been proved by a variety of authors
inserting the ansatz in
one sees that the relevant solves a nonlinear equation hartree s equation in the case of a limit
a nls equation itu u v u u itu u v u rd w u in the case of a nls or gross pitaevskii limit
in the latter case by scattering length of w
rd w should be replaced r many results in this direction have been proved over the years see the reviews and for example the by far non exhaustive following list of original references





positive temperature stationary states
the results quickly summarized in the previous subsections already put the nls theory on a rm rigorous ground as far as the description of bose einstein condensates at low temperature is concerned
but it would be highly desirable to know something about not only ground states as in subsection
but also positive temperature states
indeed in experiments the temperature is always extremely low but nite
the bose einstein condensation phenomenon in fact refers to the existence of a critical temperature below which the positive temperature equilibrium states of a bose gas show condensation in the sense that all particles reside in the ground state of nls functionals as previously dened
a satisfactory mathematically rigorous estimate of the critical temperature is still missing
a closely related question is that of the description of stationary positive temperature states in the absence of bose einstein condensation
can the nls description still be relevant in a well dened limit for such objects the canonical equilibrium state for the hamiltonian hn at temperature t is the gibbs state n t exp hn zn t t
where the partition function zn t xes the trace to be
a trace class operator on can such states or close variants converge to nls related objects in some limit what would the natural limiting objects be these questions are the subject of the paper that we summarize in this text
here we shall rst try to answer the second question
since many body gibbs states are stationary under the many body schrodinger ow one should expect that the natural limit objects are invariant under the nls ow

nonlinear gibbs measures and the nls flow nonlinear gibbs measures have recently become a useful tool to construct solutions to time dependent nonlinear schrodinger equations with rough initial data see for instance
these are probability measures which are formally dened by z
e where u is a nls like functional as discussed above
the rigorous construction of these measures is an important part of the euclidean approach to constructive quantum field theory cqft
the recent progress on the pde side has mainly been to dene the nls ow almost surely on the support of the measures which typically live over rather rough functional spaces and to prove the invariance of the measures along the associated nls ow
these objects have an obvious formal resemblance with gibbs states such as
and it is the main goal of the paper to explore this connection in more details
for the moment we can treat only the defocusing case based on taking and w in
or

this is due to well known diculties with the denition of the measures in other cases
for this reason the rest of the discussion will be mainly limited to the case although we have partial results in a more general and abstract setting for which we refer to the original paper

a reminder on classical dynamics
consider the evolution of a single classical particle
the dynamics is given by a hamilton function p rd r on the phase space of all possible positions and velocities
the hamilton equation for the dynamics of the particle is rd dene the associated gibbs measures at temperature t p exp t p dxdp
where z is a normalization factor ensuring x p p p
z p
z z these measures are of course invariant under the ow because the latter conserves the energy p and leaves the lebesgue measure invariant liouville s theorem
one should note that the gibbs measures are not any invariant measure in that they have a physically very natural variational characterization
namely they minimize the free energy functional p t log dxdp z z rdrd z z amongst probability measures which means that they achieve a balance between minimizing the energy and maximizing the entropy
again by formal analogy between
and
this time the measures
are good candidates to play a similar role in the nls theory where the dynamics is at least formally also hamiltonian


invariant measures for the nls equation
let us now recall the rigorous tion of the gibbs measure
based on the functionals
or

the way to proceed is by rst dening the free non interacting measure case formally exp u du z rd
then one denes the interacting measure as being absolutely continuous where with respect to for a given function w or even for w set exp zr z z y
where the number zr relative partition function ensures that this is a probability measure
in we have considered only cases where this construction makes sense without any need for renormalization
the free measure
the free measure is a gaussian measure over an innite dimensional hilbert space
it is dened by the following classical construction
take h a self adjoint operator on some hilbert space h with compact resolvent
for the applications in this note we shall take on r or r with either dirichlet neumann or periodic boundary conditions
the on space on which these operators act will always be denoted h
we require that r is such that these operators are positive denite
in the latter two cases one must m pick m to ensure this
we shall restrict to a for reasons that we will explain later and include the case
as a formal limit a we write the spectral of

h a m m ujih uj and dene the asociated scale of sobolev like spaces hs u uj u hs s

one can then dene a nite dimensional measure on


uk by setting dk u j exp k u u uj i h where dajdbj and aj bj are the real and imaginary part of the scalar product
u uj i h a general tightness argument for this sequence of measures allows to see that they are all cylindrical projections of a common measure living on some hs where generically s lemma
free gibbs measures
assume that there exists p such that trh hp j
then there exists a unique measure over the space such that for all k the above nite dimensional measure is the cylindrical projection of on


uk
moreover uk k ih where this is seen as an operator acting on some comments denotes the orthogonal projector onto v h
k s h
n



n
rougerie in the cases with anharmonic potentials that are our main example one can pick so that the measure lives on the original hilbert space
in general this is not the case and this is the main reason why we have so far been able to derive the nls gibbs measures only in
formally
holds one can check that in the case of a nite interval a for any p
the measure thus lives over h the usual based sobolev space for any
more generally for a laplacian on a bounded set in d dimensions the measure lives over h for all
we thus see that already in one has to consider measures over negative sobolev spaces
one might be surprised that the measure lives over a space where the energy ciated with the hamiltonian h is innite
this is however a basic fact in the theory of gaussian measures
formula
indicates that although the measure itself may live over rough spaces certain averages related to it are in fact nice compact operators over the original hilbert space
in the cases of interest to this note the right hand side of
will actually always be trace class
the interacting measure
we can now use the previous lemma to dene the interacting measure
we have to check that z z y makes sense almost surely and satises some integrability properties w

t

we only need that the relative partition function zr makes sense and is strictly positive but in the simple case under consideration we will have much stronger properties
lemma
interacting gibbs measure
consider the case where h is either
or
let p be the number in
and the free measure dened in lemma

assume that w where is a positive radon measure and a positive bounded function
the function u is in
in particular makes sense as a probability measure over
exp zr the proof consists of essentially two remarks since we work with a positive w it is sucient to check integrability properties for itself to obtain zr
this makes computations easier
that is integrable follows easily from

identifying w with the cation operator by y on the two body hilbert space we have z tr w ih z tr w where the trace is taken over the symmetric subspace
the expression in the hand side can be shown to be nite by direct estimates on the green function
when w is just a bounded function one can directly use the fact that is class
invariance under the nls ow
for the particular case
bourgain proved that the nls ow is well dened surely and that the measure is invariant under the
he also considered higher order non linearities as well as the focusing case
still in the harmonic oscillator case a in
not covered by our approach has been dealt with by burq thomann tzvetkov
here also one gets existence of the ow
s
and invariance of the measure
these measures thus play a special role in the theory of the nls ow they give a whole set of low regularity initial data for which the ow makes sense and they are a natural invariant for the dynamics
since the nls equation arises as the limit of body quantum mechanics it is very natural to wonder wether these objects can be related to equilibrium states of some many body schrodinger hamiltonian
we explain that this is indeed the case in the next section

derivation of the nls gibbs measure on a unit interval in this section we turn to describing the new results proved in
for simplicity we shall not present the full abstract setting but only those results that are relevant for the models based on
and
for which
holds with p and lemma
holds
it is in fact possible to relax these assumptions and obtain a measure which lives over negative regularity spaces whose density matrices
are not trace class but only belong to a higher schatten space
in this case the interaction operator w must be very regular and can not be of the form y
one should think of it as a regularization of a physical interaction
the many body object that gives rise to the nonlinear gibbs measure is in fact the canonical ensemble for bosonic particles
the limit we consider is a large temperature eld limit
we shall not try to discuss the physical relevance of this limit here
the main goal is to connect nonlinear gibbs measures to many body equilibrium states
in view of the results recalled in section it is then very natural to expect the former to be invariant under the nls ow


grand canonical ensemble
the grand canonical gibbs states live over a hilbert space where the particle number is not xed but seen as a random variable
namely we work in the bosonic fock space made of all possible superpositions of states with any number of particles f


r and h
everywhere in the sequel we use the notation h c c


hn





f where hk h s o sensu he worked under periodic boundary conditions only
is refered to as the trace class case in
n
rougerie for the k particles bosonic hilbert space
in this context the particle number is an operator acting on each n particle sector separately and equal to on the n particle sector the mixed states over this hilbert space are as usual the self adjoint positive trace class operators on identied with the corresponding orthogonal projectors
for any operator a on we call its expectation value in the state the quantity with trace
the pure states are the vectors of f f f whenever this has a meaning
in particular the expected or average particle number is n n i trf a h trf
n we consider the second quantized hamiltonian acting on which is the natural extension of
n n w m m h w m hj hn
f j a m xj m m here h is taken as in
or
which we include as the formal a case
the interaction potential w is chosen as in lemma
in particular w and we introduced a coupling constant
note that this choice of w is innitesimaly form bounded with respect to h even if w because of the sobolev embedding
the hamiltonian thus makes sense as a self adjoint operator
the gibbs state at temperature t for this hamiltonian is by denition the minimizer of the free energy functional dened for mixed states over entropy
minimizing over all states we clearly obtain trf t trf log f
the rst term is the energy the second the von neumann where the partition function xes the trace equal to and satises t exp t h t log where is the minimum free energy






it is useful to introduce the notion of k particle reduced density matrix for states oved
for a diagonal state of the form f gn gn hn hn m this is the operator on the k particles space hk dened trhk n trhn ak s for every bounded operator ak on hk
these are helpful for rewriting expressions involving only k particle operators
in particular the number operator involves only one body terms so the expected particle number can be computed as xn h i h i i the energy involves only two body terms and we have h trf trh
n trf w
i h h t
the limit we shall consider is i
t the rationale here is that to see a non trivial eect of the temperature in a bosonic system t should be rather large because of the bose einstein condensation phenomenon we alluded to before
then one can easily get convinced that the expected particle number behaves as t in this limit
for example consider the case
the one particle density matrix can be computed explicitly eh t after dividing by t this clearly converges to the k case of

since we assume the latter object to have a nite trace in view of
it is clear that the expected particle t is thus number of the free gibbs state grows like t
taking the coupling constant the equivalent in the grand canonical setting of the canonical limit discussed in section where the coupling constant scaled as the inverse of the particle number
note that in case in
this argument is no longer valid and the particle number will grow much faster than t
this makes this case much more dicult to deal with which is why it is not included in this note and we refer to the original paper



main theorem
let us now state the main result of this note proved in
it concerns the limit
of the previously dened grand canonical ensemble
one should not expect a convergence of the gibbs states themselves since their expected particle number diverges
neither should one hope for an estimate in some norm for well known reasons that we shall not elaborate on here
the correct objects to look at are the k body density matrices with k much smaller than the particle number in particular k xed will do
the results on ground states and dynamics we have mentioned in section are all of the form of estimates on such objects and so is the following theorem on positive temperature equilibrium states partial trace is taken over the symmetric space only

and w satisfy the assumptions of lemma

let be the gibbs measure dened therein

appearing in the right hand side of
characterizes uniquely
this measure is thus the natural unique limit object for the grand canonical ensemble
roughly speaking
is a way of making rigorous the approximation t where is the coherent state built on v z u u vk





the variational formulation
the proof of theorem
is variational
the gence of density matrices is obtained as a corollary of estimates on the minimum free energy or equivalently the partition function
an important diculty is however that is cult to control directly in particular because even at this quantity diverges very fast when t
our strategy is therefore to instead deal with the dierence between the free energies at and that is to count everything relatively to the free gibbs state
this is possible because as one easily realizes t also minimizes the relative free energy functional trf w t trf log w t trf log log log h i
amongst all mixed states
the second term in the above is the quantum relative entropy of with respect to which is always positive
the inmum of the above functional equals t log
studying the minimization of
thus allows for a direct access to the ratio of the acting and non interacting partition functions which will converge to some limit although the partition functions themselves diverge
we obtain theorem
as a corollary of the estimate theorem
asymptotics of the free energy
let zr be the relative partition function for the gibbs measure dened in lemma
with the free gibbs measure
in the limit
we have zr exp z t log zr
in order to complete the variational framework of the proof one characterizes log zr as the inmum of some variational problem of which is the solution
indeed one easily sees that minimizes z w d log d z d log d
amongst all absolutely continuous measures on the one body hilbert space h
the second term is the classical relative entropy of relative to
ih z z the semi classical nature of theorems
and
is now apparent
we have to relate the minimization problems for the quantum and classical free energy functionals
and

this means that we need to understand how to describe quantum objects operators on a hilbert space in terms of classical objects probability measures
this requires specic tools and we shall review some of these in the next section
since we work on a variational problem we can provide separately an upper and a lower bound on the free energy
the former essentially follows from the evaluation of the free energy of a trial state of the form

using some projected states in an appropriate way this can be done by adapting well known tools of nite dimensional semi classical analysis
the lower bound is as usual the tougher part and we will try to give some of the main ideas in the sequel

some tools of the proof the rst point is to characterize the limits of quantum states over the fock space in terms of classical objects i
e
probability measures over the one body hilbert space
this is the object of the so called quantum finetti theorem that we discuss rst
it will be rather clear from this kind of results how one can deal with the interaction energy term in

the relative entropy term requires new specic tools discussed in a second subsection


quantum finetti measures
the main message of the quantum orem is informally that for many practical purposes any bosonic state looks like a convex combination of product states
a little bit more precisely if one picks a bosonic n state with n large and look at its k body density matrix for k small one obtains almost a convex combination of product states
there is a vast literature devoted to rigorous statements and proofs of these claims
we shall not review it here in details see
for the purpose of this note we rely n
rougerie on recent approaches and versions of the theorem due mainly to ammari nier and nam rougerie
to deal with the case where in
some improvements are necessary provided in but for the proof of the previous theorems the following result of is sucient theorem
grand canonical quantum finetti theorem
let n be a sequence of states on the fock space sequence n such that for all n f h
assume that there exists a i then there exists a unique borel probability measure on h such that along a subsequence h k n trhk n ck
n uk ih zh

weakly in the trace class for every integer
some comments the measure is called the finetti measure of the sequence n
it is the classical object we are after
its existence is a rather general fact based mostly on the bosonic symmetry of the states under consideration
theorems
and
can be rephrased as saying that the finetti measure of the sequence t is the nonlinear gibbs measure
here n should be thought of as a semiclassical parameter essentially forcing the particle number to behave as n
to apply this result in our context we need to check that
holds with n t and t
in the context of this note this is not too dicult because the particle number is well under control
bounds in some state naturally translate into trace class bounds on the expectation of on the k body density matrix
since we here get convergence of density matrices a lower bound to the interaction energy term in
follows from this theorem
n

berezin lieb inequality for the relative entropy
there remains to understand how to estimate the relative entropy term in

one should keep the following in mind contrarily to the energy it is not expressed in terms of reduced density matrices only
it genuinely depends of the full state
one should not undo the relative entropy to consider only the von neumnann entropies of and t directly since we do not expect a good control on those
the main tool to link quantum entropy terms to their semiclassical counterparts are the so called berezin lieb inequalities
since we work in innite dimensions and we can not undo the relative entropy to rely on known inequalities we need the following new result and theorem
berezin lieb inequality for the relative entropy
let n rem

let and be their finetti measures
then d d log log n n lim inf n n log n d d trf n d
z be two sequences of states satisfying the assumptions of
some comments clearly this will give the desired lower bound to the relative entropy term in
if we can prove rst that the finetti measure of the free gibbs state is given by
since all the density matrices of can be explicitly computed this is easily shown by direct inspection
for the proof of this result we rely heavily on a constructive approach to the proof of theorem

indeed not only the existence of the measure is crucial but also the precise way one can approach it by explicit functions of the states
the link with semi classics proceeds by seeing the finetti measure both as a lower symbol covariant symbol husimi function anti wick quantization and as an approximate upper symbol contravariant symbol wigner measure wick tion based on a coherent state decomposition made of projectors onto states of the form

joint convexity we also rely on deep properties of the quantum relative entropy and monotonicity under two positive trace preserving maps
these are in fact equivalent to the strong subadditivity of the quantum entropy a crucial property proved by lieb and ruskai
