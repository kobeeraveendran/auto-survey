semileptonic b decays and determination vxb giulia ricciardi
introduction vxb the parameters of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ckm matrix play a central role in the analyses of the unitarity triangle and in testing the standard model sm
the long standing tension among their values depending on whether they are extracted using exclusive or inclusive semi leptonic b decays also motivates more and more precise theoretical and experimental gations
we briey discuss recent results on the exclusive determination of on the inclusive
determination of vcb vub and on
exclusive determination vcb we can express the differential ratios for the semi leptonic ckm favoured decays b in terms of the recoil parameter pb which corresponds to the energy ferred to the leptonic pair
for negligible lepton masses each ratio depends on one form factor f for b dl and the phase space vanishes at the no recoil point in both cases
summarizing we can write dl and g for b md pd d d d d f f vcb g vcb
in the heavy quark limit both form factors are related to a single isgur wise function f g which is normalized to unity at zero recoil that is
there are perturbative corrections to this prediction expressed at the zero recoil point by the heavy quark symmetry under the form of powers of qcd m where m mc and mb
other corrections are perturbatively calculable radiative corrections from hard gluons and photons
in order to extract the ckm factors we need not only to compute the form factors but also to measure experimental decay rates which vanish at zero recoil
therefore experimental points are extrapolated to zero recoil using a parametrization of the dependence on of the form tor
several recent extrapolations to zero recoil adopt a parametrization where is mapped onto
the a complex variable z via the conformal transformation z form factors may be written in form of an expansion in z which converges rapidly in the matical region of heavy hadron decays
the coefcients of the expansions are subject to unitarity bounds based on analyticity
common examples are the cln caprini lellouch neubert the bgl boyd grinstein lebed and the bcl bourrely caprini lellouch parameterizations
they are all constructed to satisfy the unitarity bounds but the cln approach differs mostly in its reliance on next to leading order hqet relations between the form factors
because of such additional constraints the accuracy of the cln approach has been questioned in both b d l channels
the way out of parametrization dependence is to compute and b the form factors at nonzero recoil values
in the case of b d decays the form factors in the unquenched lattice qcd approximation are available for a range of non zero recoil momenta since differential rates and angular
lastly we remark that combined ts to b tions can help constraining the form factors and allow not only the extraction of but also of form factor ratios under various scenarios

semileptonic b decays and determination vxb giulia ricciardi
b d channel the form factor f at zero recoil for the b d channel in the lattice unquenched n approximation has been estimated rst by the fnal milc collaboration which used wilson fermions for both c and b heavy quarks f



the rst error is statistical and the second one is the sum in quadrature of all systematic errors
the total uncertainty is around the level
the largest error is the heavy quark discretization error related to the fermilab action
the lanl swme collaboration is working to reduce it by using an improved version of the fermilab action the oktay kronfeld action
other preliminary results concern analyses at non zero recoil and with mobius domain wall quarks at zero and zero recoil from n qcd
a recent value of the form factor f has been presented by the hpqcd collaboration which used the fully relativistic hisq highly improved staggered quarks action for light strange and charm quarks and the nrqcd nonrelativistic qcd action for the bottom quark f


both the results in eq

and eq

are in good agreement
the form factor in eq

using the cln parametrization the hflav average gives vcb vcb

the flag n average value yields vcb vcb



this average employs the hflav experimental average f

vcb in for the rst time the unfolded fully differential decay rate and associated covariance matrix have been published by the belle collaboration prompting several independent minations of the value of under different theoretical approaches
most notably using the belle measurement it has been argued that previous determinations using the cln form factor parameterisation could be affected by underestimated uncertainties and fore form factor analyses based on bgl should be preferred
the previous analyses in the bgl framework appear consistent with each other and give using t lattice zero recoil form factors the values vcb



the central values are higher than the corresponding values in the cln parametrization and closer to the values from the inclusive approach
on the other side it has also been argued that ts that vcb vcb

cln lqcd bgl lqcd the value of branching fraction is found to be insensitive to the choice of the parameterization
both sets of ts give acceptable ndf therefore the data do not discriminate between the eterizations
form factor estimates via zero recoil sum rules give in general relatively higher values of and a theoretical error more than twice the error in the lattice determinations
cently form factors determinations from b meson light cone sum rules beyond leading twist have been presented

the b d channel for b d decay form factors are available for a range of recoil momenta by both the fnal milc collaboration and the hpqcd collaboration
by parameterizing the pendence on momentum transfer using the bgl parameterization the former collaboration has determined from the relative normalization over the entire range of recoil momenta vcb vcb

the rst error consists of the lattice simulation errors and the experimental statistical error and the second error is the experimental systematic error

here the lattice results as well as belle and babar data have been used

inclusive determination vub vub in order to extract from semileptonic b xu decays one has to reduce the b in order to face this problem that is absent in the inclusive determination of semileptonic background through experimental cuts
such cuts enhance the relevance of the called threshold region in the phase space jeopardizing the use of operator product expansion techniques
different theoretical schemes have been devised which are tailored to analyze data in the threshold region but differ in their treatment of perturbative corrections and the parametrization of perturbative effects
in table we present the results for four theoretical different approaches as analyzed by babar belle and hflav collaborations that is adfr blnp and ggou
although conceptually quite different all these approaches lead to roughly consistent results when the same inputs are used and the theoretical errors are taken into account
generally these values are higher compared to corresponding vcb table status of inclusive inclusive decays hflav babar belle adfr

the tension is of the order of depending on the chosen framework
when averaged the adfr value is lower than the ones obtained with the other three approaches and closer to the exclusive values
by taking the arithmetic average of the results obtained from these four different qcd predictions of the partial rate the babar collaboration gives vub




the latest analyses and theoretical progresses in semi leptonic heavy to light decays involve power corrections global ts to inclusive rare and semileptonic data and most neural networks have also been used to parameterize the shape functions and extract in the ggou framework
the results are in good agreement with the original paper

at belle ii prospects are good for improvements of the determination with both inclusive and exclusive approaches thanks to more data and better reconstruction performance

exclusive b c decays into heavy leptons in the sm the couplings to the w bosons are universal for all leptons and processes showing non universality would indicate physics beyond the sm
this universality can be tested in tonic b meson decays involving a lepton through the ratio of branching fractions d d
this ratio is typically used instead of the the denominator is the average for decays in order to cancel uncertainties common to the lute branching fraction of b numerator and the denominator
these include the ckm matrix element and several theoretical uncertainties on hadronic form factors and experimental reconstruction effects
d in the sm values for have been calculated already in by means of hqe giving a later lattice estimate yields



the discussion on different parameterizations briey outlined in sect
has prompted in new sm determinations in the bgl parameterization
these are generally consistent with the old predictions for
their arithmetic average as given by hflav is as far as is concerned lattice sm predictions have been averaged by the flag collaboration yielding as before recent calculations have been performed in the bgl parameterization and their arithmetic hflav average is





exclusive semi tauonic b decays were rst observed by the belle collaboration in
subsequent analysis by babar and belle measured branching fractions above although consistent with the sm predictions
in babar has measured by using its full data sample and reported a signicant excess over the sm expectation conrmed in by the rst measurement of using the semileptonic tagging method belle
in a conrmation came also by the lhcb collaboration who has studied the decay b with d in pp collisions
and





semileptonic b decays and determination vxb giulia ricciardi in the belle collaboration reported a new measurement in the hadronic decay modes statistically independent of the previous belle measurements with a different background composition
these results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the sm in ref
within
standard deviations
they also reported the rst measurement of the lepton ization in the decay b d which is again compatible with sm expectations
last year the lhcb collaboration has measured in agreement with the sm prediction
by averaging the most recent measurements the hflav collaboration has found







where the rst uncertainty is statistical and the second one is systematic
rd and rd exceed the sm values by about and respectively
if one consider both deviations the tension rises to about
at belle ii a better understanding of backgrounds tails under the signal and a reduction of the uncertainty to for rd and for rd is expected at ab
