a lemma based evaluator for semitic language text summarization systems tarek el and fatma el benha university cairo faculty of engineering shoubra egypt electronics research institute cairo egypt abstract matching texts in highly inflected languages such as arabic by simple stemming strategy is unlikely to perform well
in this paper we present a strategy for automatic text matching technique for for inflectional languages using arabic as the test case
the system is an extension of rouge test in which texts are matched on token lemma level
the experimental results show an enhancement of detecting similarities between different sentences having same semantics but written in different lexical forms


introduction evaluation of automatic text summarization systems by human evaluators requires massive efforts
this hard expensive effort has held up researchers looking for methods to evaluate summaries automatically
current automated methods compare fragments of the summary to be assessed against one or more reference summaries typically produced by humans measuring how much fragments in the reference summary is present in the generated summary
in semitic languages such as arabic many sentence structures can be written to express the same semantic
this adds more complexity to assessed tools that measures the similarity of human and machine summaries
therefore in this paper we propose a lemma based system for evaluating similarity of given texts

the presented work is an extension of rouge test which is widely used for evaluating the performance of summarization techniques
the presented work is based on representing words in their lemma forms and modifying text similarity to be evaluated on token instead of character level
the results show that this technique is more suitable for measuring similarity of arabic texts
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section describes rouge evaluation measure and other previous works
in section we discuss the lemma based form of arabic words
section describes the proposed lemma based rouge evaluation technique
section describes the datasets and the experiment used to evaluate the proposed system

previous works evaluation of automatic text summarization systems can be extrinsic or intrinsic evaluation methods
in extrinsic evaluation the summary quality is judged on the basis of how helpful summaries are for a given task such as how well they can answer certain questions relative to the full source text
intrinsic evaluation has mainly focused on the informativeness of summaries
this is often done by comparing the system summary to reference human summary
rouge stands for recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation is a recall measure that counts the number of overlapping n units between the system summary generated by computer and several reference summaries produced by human
rouge has proved to be a successful algorithm
several variants of the measure were introduced such as rouge and rouge
rouge n is an n gram recall between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries
it is defined by the following formula where n is the length of the n gram gramn is the number of n grams in the reference summaries and is the maximum number of grams co occurring in a system summary and in reference summaries
rouge s utilizes skip bigram co occurrence statistics
skip bigram any pair of words in their sentence order allowing for arbitrary gaps
rouge s measures the overlap ratio of skip bigrams between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries
in our work we adopted a lemma based rouge measure by applying an arabic lemmatizer for stemming in the rouge evaluation process
an n gram is a subsequence of n words from a given text

lemmatization of arabic words there is no general agreement of the representation level of arabic words in ir systems
two levels have been debated root level and stem level
motivated by the power of arabic roots the first approach represents words in their root forms
historically a root was the entry to traditional arabic lexicons
almost every word in arabic is originated from a root
many researchers have emphasized that the use of arabic roots as indexing terms substantially improves the information retrieval effectiveness
several researchers criticized this approach and based their representation on stems
a stem is the least marked form of a word that is the uninflected word without suffixes prefixes
the main problem in selecting a root as a standard representation level in information retrieval systems is the over semantic classification
many words that do not have similar semantic interpretations are grouped into same root
on the other hand stem level suffers from under semantic classification
stem pattern may exclude many similar words sharing the same semantic properties
in this work we use the lemma form of arabic words
in the field of nlp lemmatization refers to the process of relating a given textual item to the actual lexical or grammatical morpheme
lemma refers to the set of all word forms that have the same meaning and hence capture semantic similarities between words
shishtawy and el ghannam proposed the first non statistical accurate arabic lemmatizer that is suitable for information retrieval ir systems
the proposed lemmatizer makes use of different arabic language knowledge resources to generate accurate lemma form and its relevant features that support ir purposes

lemma based evaluation we have modified the existing rouge evaluation methods implemented in the dragon toolkit java based package

rouge is based on counting the number of n grams co occurring in a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries
human judge can match different word forms presented by the machine and a reference summaries such as organize organizes and organizing
stemming has a large effect on arabic information retrieval due to the highly inflected nature of the language
rouge test can accept different word granularity level of the n grams terms original word or stem form
the dragon toolkit supports the extraction of word stem by the porter stemmer but does not support the arabic language
as illustrated in section the lemma form can relate different word forms that have the same meaning
the main advantage of lemma form is that it can conflate different word forms that stem can not do
therefore the first modification is to apply the arabic lemmatizer for extracting the word canonical forms for both documents to be compared prior to the rouge evaluation process
the original rouge is an n grams system where grams are set in terms of number of characters
this may be useful when comparing lemmatized words hoping to overcome morphological variations
the used lemma forms eliminate the need for character level comparisons
it was shown in other works that text similarity measurement can be greatly enhanced when measured at token level

therefore the second modification is to use tokens instead of characters as a basis of comparison
the modifications are given by the following formula to perform the test first the machine and reference summaries are applied to the arabic lemmatizer to extract their lemma forms
second the output from the lemmatizer is passed to the dragon toolkit for the evaluation process with grams modified to be words
we apply an experiment to compare the rouge results with and without using the lemmatizer

datasets and results to test the proposed lemma based evaluator two datasets were adopted
the first was tac
it was selected to evaluate and compare the summaries of the new techniques against the published summaries of systems presented in tac using the same dataset for the same task of producing words summary
included the source texts system summaries and human summaries
the data set is available in languages including arabic
it was derived from publicly available wikinews english texts
texts in other languages
nist
gov
have been translated by native speakers of each language
the source texts contain ten collections of related newswire and newspaper articles
each collection contains a cluster of ten related articles
the average number of words per article is words
each cluster of related articles deals with news about a single event
each article in a certain cluster includes a limited number of topics mostly one or two topics about the event
some topics are dealt with by many documents while others are addressed in a single document
experimental results arabic summaries of the dataset described in the previous section were used in this experiment
the dataset already includes the summarization results generated by systems under test as well as the reference human summaries
the proposed lemma based evaluator was applied to all summaries and the experimental results were reported in terms of and rouge s
precision p recall r and f measure were calculated for each measure
tables show a comparison between the evaluation techniques when applied to different existing summarization systems
evaluation techniques are native and native rouge s measures and proposed lemma rouge measures
the results show that the two proposed techniques perform well when compared to native
in all evaluations sen rich technique outperformed all systems by a significant margin in rouge s measure it gains
compared to the next ranking
for classy and
for doc rich
another experiment was also applied to compare the effect of adding the lemmatizer in the rouge test
we applied the rouge test without adding the lemmatizer using the dragon toolkit and comparing the results with that previously reported in the case of adding the lemmatizer
as expected the results show better results for all systems when using the lemmatizer
this improvement is due to increasing the number of matching tokens between the machine and reference summaries when using the lemmatizer
the proposed system was used also in evaluating multiple documents summarization

classy conclusion









we have presented a technique for measuring similarity between texts suitable for semitic languages
the highly inflections inherent to such languages as makes the current evaluation techniques not suitable for detecting semantically equivalent sentences written in different syntactic forms
we extended rouge system so that texts are matched on token lemma level
the published results of systems were used to evaluate different systems using the new technique
the experimental results indicated that adding the lemmatizer improves the rouge results of all systems
