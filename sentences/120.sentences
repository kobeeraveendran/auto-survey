v i x r a abstract social media platforms contain great wealth of mation which provides us opportunities explore hidden patterns or unknown correlations and understand people s satisfaction with what they are discussing
as one showcase in this paper we summarize the data set of twitter messages related to recent demonetization of all rs
and rs
notes in india and explore insights from twitter s data
our proposed system automatically extracts the popular latent topics in conversations regarding demonetization discussed in twitter via the latent dirichlet allocation lda based topic model and also identies the correlated topics across different categories
additionally it also discovers people s opinions expressed through their tweets related to the event under consideration via the emotion analyzer
the system also employs an intuitive and informative ization to show the uncovered insight
furthermore we use an evaluation measure normalized mutual information nmi to select the best lda models
the obtained lda results show that the tool can be effectively used to extract discussion topics and summarize them for further manual analysis

introduction analyzing news stories have been pivotal for nding out some of the quantitative and qualitative attributes from text documents
a broad domain like news analytics incorporates the use of various text mining methods to analyze text
it applies methods from natural language processing chine learning information retrieval
in our study the qualitative attributes can be socio economic tags related to demonetization in india
the sentiment score which generally reects the tone positive negative of the text as well as the emotions expressed can be one of the quantitative attributes
in this paper we have dealt with two problems in the domain of news analytics rstly is text categorization without any prior domain knowledge i
e
topic modeling and secondly is emotion analysis
for example we are trying to investigate how emotions of people relate to demonetization in india
for text categorization we have clustered the news stories into several k topics unsupervised learning with automatic topic labeling i
e
topic modeling
topic modeling reects the thematic structure of the collection of documents by treating data as observations which gets derived from a ative probabilistic process that comprises hidden variables for documents
inferring them using posterior inference results the topics generation that describes its corpus
the emotion analysis also referred as sentiment extraction would give an emotion association score to each story depending on the expressive tone of the story in basic emotions categories and two sentiments positive negative deciding the tone of the overall story
introduction is here
the roadmap of the paper is as follows
data preparation and exploratory insights are described in section
section is on background
section reveals our proposed system architecture
section deals with the experiment setup
section gives the results
section draws conclusions from discussions and points to future work

data set ii
data the data has been collected over a period of two months from november to december across four metro cities delhi kolkata mumbai and chennai based on sets of keywords corresponding to demonetization in india e

demonet black money cashless
using twitter s streaming api and was stored into mongodb
we approximately collected tweets in the order of retweet count during the period
novel data comprise tion date and time user id user name tweets message and geographical area
due to the huge volume of novel data we divide the data into only with dates user ids and text and conduct further operation and analysis based on the three variables
most of the tweets are written in english but the original raw data set also includes the tweets in vernacular languages such as hindi or bengali
we did exclude them in the initial data manipulation process
the data from the nosql database was imported into r console using the tm package in cran library to construct the document term matrix for use in developing the topic model
b
exploratory insight we explore the time series analysis of tweets over given time period
we visualize the number of retweet by hour minute average number of words by hour
we also explore which users have contributed to maximum tweets in our corpus
it also determines user s inuence over others in terms of his retweet count
out of tweets we see that most of the tweets are from twitter web client source followed by windows phone iphone sources
we see that more than users have tweeted more than tweets for the event under consideration

data preprocessing before applying any of the sentiment emotion extraction methods we perform data preprocessing
data preprocessing allows to produce higher quality of text classication and reduce the computational complexity
typical preprocessing procedure includes the following steps stemming and lemmatization
stemming is a procedure of replacing words with their stems or roots
the dimensionality of the bag of words representation is reduced when related words such as read reader and reading are mapped into one word read
over stemming lowers precision and under stemming lowers recall
the overall impact of stemming depends on the dataset and stemming algorithm
the most popular stemming algorithm is porter stemmer
stop words removal
stop words are words which carry a connecting function in the sentence such as prepositions articles
there is no denite list of stop words but some search machines are using some of the most common short function words such as the is at which and on
these words can be removed from the text before classication since they have a high frequency of occurrence in the text but do not affect the nal sentiment of the sentence
tf idf model
term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf divides the term frequencies by the document frequencies number of documents were the jth word has appeared
this adjustment is done in order to lower the weightage of those words which are common across all the documents
the tf idf measure suggests how important the term is for the particular document
in tf idf scheme words which are common across all documents will automatically get less importance
preprocessing of tweet include following points remove all urls e

www
xyz
com hash tags e

topic targets correct the spellings sequence of repeated characters is to be handled replace all the emoticons with their sentiment
remove all punctuations symbols numbers remove stop words remove non english tweets iii
background a
introduction to lda previously documents were treated as a bag of words approach as in many models which dealt with text documents
topic modeling adopts that a document is a of topics instead of a bag of words representation and its sole purpose is to cluster each term in each document into a relevant topic
a variations of different probabilistic topic models have been proposed and lda is considered to be a well known method
alike other methods the input to lda is a term document matrix and the output of lda is composed of two distributions namely topic distribution and topic word distribution
em and gibbs sampling algorithms were proposed to derive the distributions of and
in this paper we use the gibbs sampling based lda
in this approach one of the most signicant step is updating each topic assignments individually for each term in every documents according to the probabilities calculated using equation
cw t cw t vk vk v p zi k wi v zi wi c dt dk c dt dk k where zi k represents that the ith term in a document is assigned to topic k wi v is the mapping of the observed term wi to the vth term in the corpus s vocabulary and zi signies all the assignments of topic except the ith term
cw t is the frequency of occurrence of term v assigned to a particular topic k and cdt dk is the number of times that the document d contains the topic
moreover k is the user input denoting the number of topics v represents the vocabularys size parameters for the document topic distribution and topic word distribution are denoted by and respectively
by default and are set to k and

we perform n iterations of gibbs sampling for every terms in the corpus and after this we estimate the document topic and topic word distributions respectively using equations and
dk c dt c dt dk dk k vk cw t cw t vk vk v b
emotion analysis emotion classication is fundamentally a text classication problem
traditional sentiment classication mainly classies documents as positive negative and neutral
in this scenario the emotion is ne grained into basic emotions such as anger fear anticipation trust surprise sadness joy and disgust
in this paper the nrc word emotion association lexicon corpus is selected as the labeled corpus
it comprises a list of english words and their associations with plutchik s eight basic emotions and two sentiments negative and positive
it involves three variables targetword egory and associationflag
targetword is a word for which emotion associations are provided
affectcategory is one of eight emotions or one of two polarities negative or positive
associationflag has one of two possible values or
indicates that the target word has no association with affect category whereas indicates an association
fig
shows the process to identify a crowd type from social media
what are the topics discussed by people online to help us understand people s interests what are people s opinion on the specic topics to help us understand their satisfaction of those topics the term document matrix is created which is fed to lda based model for discovering latent topics and the documents are analyzed by the emotion analyzer
then emotion analyzer will tag each tweet as happy sad angry fear surprise or neutral

nmi in the experiment we used nmi normalized mutual formation to evaluate overall documents tweets cluster quality
the following formula is used to calculate nmi n m y y where is mutual information between x and y where x


xn and y


yn
xi is the set of text reviews in lda s topic i while yj is the set of text reviews with the label j
in our experiments a text review with the label j means that the text review has the highest probability of belonging to topic j n is the number of topics
is y y log yy xx y in the formula means probability of being classied to topic i means probability of labeled to topic j while yj means probability of being classied to cluster i but actually labeled to cluster j
is entropy of x as calculated by the following formula log n the clustering result is totally different from the label if the value of nmi is and is identical if value of nmi is
iv
proposed system architecture we propose a system that consists of three main components including data collection data analysis and data visualization
the data collection module is developed to crawl the tweets from twitter using data crawlers and to store the tweets into mongodb a nosql database for scalability and scheme less data storage purpose
after data preprocessing steps such as tokenization stemming and stopwords removal the system mainly performs two different types of analyses to answer the following questions fig
proposed system architecture v
experimental setup for the demonetization data we started with default rameters

and input parameter topic number n which means desired topics
by comparing the lda result given in table ii we choose topic number n as a basic group for further comparison since when n most topics have enough words to reveal information about the topic while without too much words to make the topics messy
in the next step of our experiment we set n and tuning parameter and by setting


while


to see if the results show any difference
we performed the emotion analysis using syuzhet cran package which is based on nrc emotion lexicon on the dataset
as a result tweets were labeled with one of eight emotions anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust and two sentiments positive and negative to determine the overall tone of the event

lda models







nmi results



the results show that with fewer topics the nmi value tends to be higher
since nmi presents similarity of clustered tweets set and labelled tweets set the overall nmi results indicate that with fewer topics tweets set are more correctly clustered
the reason for this phenomenon could be the length of each document tweet is much shorter if compared to traditional documents
since the length for each tweet is limited usually no longer than characters information contained in a single tweet is also limited
hence when the number of topics increases many topics tend to contain the same words as a result it is hard to determine to which topic a document be assigned
in further experiments we can use different tweeter pooling schemes and see whether they affect the nmi results
c
emotion count fig
shows the distribution of emotions during this event
as can be seen the dominating emotion is trust followed by anticipation and anger
the reason might be that due to the mixed reactions of people expressing their thoughts and opinions through tweets
more than tweets express trust as an emotion
around tweets express anticipation
tweets express fear with a count of around tweets of anger emotion around tweets are of disgust and tweets express sadness
disgust emotion was the least emotion expressed in our study
more than tweets express positive sentiment and around indicate negative sentiments

mation related to experiences and practices in consumption is shared in this new media form
text mining is an emergent technique for mining valuable information from the web cially related to social media
our objective is to discovering tweets semantic patterns in users discussions and trend on social media about demonetization in india
in order to detect conversations in connection to the event under consideration we applied latent dirichlet allocation based probabilistic system to discover latent topics
we varied the lda parameters to nd a model whose output is more informative as evaluated by nmi
performance of the lda models were not affected by changes in distribution parameters and
at the same time the results signicantly changed with the change of topic numbers
as we expected the quality of lda results also depends on the amount of records in the data
manual analysis of the results revealed that lda is able to extract most of the detailed information from the data
it extracts all the major event components including the people involved how the event unfolded
however in some topics we ca nt infer to a specic label due to its mixed nature
it is also important to note that all the extracted topics are related to the events covered by the collected data
our method not only condes to the analysis of case study presented but also signicant to the analysis of twitter data collected in similar settings
from our analysis we observed that the positive response has exceeded the negative aspects about the demonetization discussion as shown in the emotion distribution plot in fig
which also does not rule out large section of people have raised voices against the event
trust anticipation and anger are the top emotions in count which reects that our study is not biased towards one polarity
understanding the inuence of social networks can help government agencies to better understand how such tion can be used not only in the dissemination of a economical event but can also help to draw responses that could help to mitigating an unruly reaction or preventing violence from starting and escalating
