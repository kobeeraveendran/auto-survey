introduction nature has provided us with a variety of neutrino sources from the not yet observed
k cosmological background to the icecube pev neutrinos whose origin is still mysterious
neutrinos are intriguing weakly ing particles
after many unknown properties have been determined thanks to the discovery of neutrino oscillations rst proposed in and served by the super kamiokande experiment using atmospheric neutrinos
this discovery is fundamental for particle physics for astrophysics and for cosmology
neutrino oscillations is an interference phenomenon among the mass eigenstates that occurs if neutrinos are massive and if the mass tion basis and the avor interaction basis do not coincide
the nakagawa sakata pontecorvo matrix relates these two basis
within three active avors such a matrix depends on three mixing angles one dirac and two majorana cp violating phases
in the last two decades lar reactor and accelerator experiments have precisely determined most of the oscillation parameters including the so called atmospheric

and solar squared dierences
moreover the sign of has been measured since neutrinos undergo the mikheev smirnov wolfenstein msw eect in the sun
the sign of is still unknown either lectures presented at winter school of theoretical physics volpe printed on september and the lightest mass eigenstate is normal ordering or hierarchy or it is inverted ordering
most of neutrino oscillation iments can be interpreted within the framework of three active neutrinos
however a few measurements present anomalies that require further cation
sterile neutrinos that do not couple to the gauge bosons but mix with the other active species could be the origin of the anomalies
ing experiments such as stereo or cesox will cover most of the mixing parameters identied in particular by the reactor anomaly
among the fundamental properties yet to be determined are the anism for the neutrino mass the absolute mass value and ordering the neutrino nature dirac versus majorana the existence of cp violation in the lepton sector and of sterile neutrinos
the combined analysis of available experimental results shows a preference for normal ordering and for a zero cp violating phase currently favouring although statistical signicance is still low
in the coming experiments will aim at determining the mass ordering the dirac cp violating phase the neutrino absolute mass and hopefully nature as well
moreover super kamiokande with gadolinium should have the sensitivity to discover the relic supernova neutrino background

solar neutrinos electron neutrinos are constantly produced in our sun and in low mass main sequence stars through the proton proton pp nuclear reaction chain that produces of their energy by burning hydrogen into
the corresponding solar neutrino ux receives contributions from both fusion reactions and beta decays of and figure
first measured by r
davis pioneering experiment such ux was found to be nearly a factor of three below predictions
over the decades solar neutrino experiments have precisely measured electron neutrinos from the dierent pp branches usually referred to as the pp pep and and hep neutrinos
the measurement of a reduced solar neutrino ux compared to standard solar model predictions the so called the solar neutrino decit problem has been conrmed by experiments mainly sensitive to electron neutrinos but with some sensitivity to the other avors
the advocated solutions included unknown neutrino properties e

vor oscillations a neutrino magnetic moment coupling to the solar magnetic elds neutrino decay the msw eect and questioned the standard solar model
in particular the msw eect is due to the neutrino interaction with matter while they traverse a medium
the solar puzzle is denitely solved by the discovery of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon and the results obtained by the sno and volpe printed on september fig

the left gure shows the proton proton pp nuclear reaction chain with its three branches
the pp chain is responsible for energy production in our sun and low mass stars
the theoretical branching percentages dene the relative rates of the competing reactions
the right gure shows the cn i cycle which is thought to play an important role for energy production in massive stars
the and neutrinos have not been observed yet
land experiments see for a review on solar neutrino physics
in fact using elastic scattering and current neutrino actions on heavy water the sno experiment has showed that the surement of the total solar neutrino ux is consistent with the tions of the standard solar model solar electron neutrinos convert into the other active avors
in particular the muon and tau neutrino ponents of the solar ux has been measured at
moreover the reactor experiment kamland has denitely identied the large mixing angle lma solution by observing reactor electron anti neutrino pearance at an average distance of km
the ensemble of these observations shows that low energy solar neutrinos are suppressed by aged vacuum oscillations while neutrinos having more than mev energy are suppressed because of the msw eect figure
theoretically one expects p e e
with for mev solar neutrinos for high energy portion of the spectrum the dominated survival probability is p e density
see
the precise determination of the transition between the vacuum averaged and the lma solution brings valuable information since deviations from the simplest vacuum lma transition could point to new physics such as non standard neutrino interactions
the borexino experiment has precisely measured the low energy part of the solar neutrino ux namely the pep
moreover by ing challenging reduced backgrounds the collaboration has reported the volpe printed on september fig

electron neutrino survival probability as a function of the neutrino energy for the pp pep neutrinos from the borexino experiment
the results are compared to averaged vacuum oscillation prediction e mev and the msw prediction e mev taking into account present uncertainties on mixing angles
figure from
rst direct measurement of pp neutrino the keystone of the fusion process in the sun
the measured ux is consistent with the standard solar model predictions
the ensemble of solar observations has established that the sun produces
ergs s via the pp chain
moreover the occurrence of the msw eect for the high energy solar neutrinos shows that these particles change avor in vacuum in a very dierent way than in matter
in fact in the central high density regions of the star the avor coincide with the matter eigenstates
during their propagation towards the edge of the sun they encounter a resonance if the msw resonance condition is fullled and evolve adiabatically through it depending on the neutrino energies mass dierence value and the gradient of the matter density
adiabaticity implies that the matter eigenstates mixing is suppressed at the resonance
in the latter case electron neutrinos can eciently convert into muon and tau neutrinos
the msw phenomenon is analogous to the two level system in quantum mechanics
it occurs in numerous contexts including the early universe at the epoch of the primordial elements formation massive stars like core collapse supernovae accretion disks aroung black holes and the earth
future measurements will aim at observing solar neutrinos produced in the carbon nitrogen oxygen cno cycle which is thought to be the volpe printed on september main mechanism for energy production in massive main sequence stars
borexino experiment has provided the strongest constraint on the cno cycle which represents of energy production in the sun consistent with standard solar model predictions
the achievement of increased purity both by borexino and could allow to reach the sensivity for this challenging measurement
beyond furnishing conrmation of stellar evolutionary models the servation of cno neutrinos could help solving the so called solar ity problem
standard solar models predict solar neutrino uxes from the pp cycle in agreement with observations
however the sfii and sfii models dier for their treatment of the metal element tributions elements heavier than he
the rst model uses older dances for volatile elements that are obtained by an absorption line ysis in which the photosphere is treated as one dimensional that yields a metallicity of z
z and x being the metal and hydrogen abundances respectively with solar fusion ii cross sections sfii
the second model takes abundances from a three dimensional photospheric model z
sfii
the latter produces a cooler core by and lower uxes of temperature sensitive neutrinos such as ones
a comparison of the solar parameters used in the two models and sponding predictions on the neutrino uxes are given in tables and of ref

the solar opacity problem is the inconsistency between that uses the best description of the solar photosphere while has the best agreement with helioseimic data that are sensitive to the interior position
since there is approximately dierence between c and n abundances in the two models a measurement of cno neutrinos with precision which could be achieved in the future will allow to determine the solar opacity

supernova neutrinos

core collapse supernovae and core collapse supernovae sne are stars with mass m msun msun being the sun s mass whose core undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of their life
these include types ii and ib c depending on their spectral properties
they are of type ii if they exhibit h lines in their spectra and of type i if they do nt because the star has lost the h envelope
sne iib have a thin h envelope type ii p and ii l present a plateau or a linear decay of the light curves after the peak
the sne ib shows he and si lines while sne ic shows none of these indicating that before collapse the star has lost both the h envelope and he shells
the supernova can still appear as bright if the h envelope is present otherwise it can be invisible type ib c
volpe printed on september fig

picture of years after its explosion with its three rings
the inner blowing ring was formed years before the explosion
in hoyle and fowler proposed that stellar death of snii and i b happens because of the implosion of the core
the same year colgate and johnson suggested that a bounce of the neutron star forming launches a shock that ejects the matter to make it unbound the prompt model
it was realised by colgate and white that a gravitational binding energy of the order of e gm n s rn s erg associated with the collapse of the star core to a neutron star ns would be released as neutrinos that would deposit energy to trigger the explosion
arnett and wilson critized the model because it would not give enough energy
wilson revisited the model and developed it further the ejection of the mantle would be preceded by an accreting phase in the so called delayed neutrino heating mechanism
the fate of a massive star is mainly determined by the initial mass and composition and the history of its mass loss
their explosion produces either neutron stars or black holes directly or by fallback
their initial masses range from to solar masses msun
stars having msun develop an o ne mg core while those with m msun possess an iron core before collapse
hypernovae are asymmetric stellar explosions with high ejecta velocities they are very bright producing a large amount of nickel
they are often associated with long duration gamma ray bursts
collapsars are all massive stars whose core collapse to a black hole and that have sucient angular momentum to form a disk see e


on february sk exploded producing the rst naked eye supernova since kepler s one in
it was located in the large volpe printed on september magellanic cloud a satellite galaxy of the milky way
the determined tance is kpc from the earth based on the expanding photosphere method from dierent groups which agree within see table i of
this method to establish extragalactic distances allows to cover a wide range from kpc to mpc
from the observed light curve and simulations it appears that the core mass of progenitor was around msun and total mass msun and the progenitor radius about cm
is unique because it was observed in all wavelengths from gamma rays to radio and for the rst time neutrinos were observed from the lapse of the stellar core
the neutrinos was rst discovered by kamiokande ii then by imb and baksan
the number of detected electron anti neutrinos events were in kamiokande ii in imb and in baksan
time energy sn angle and background rate for all the events is given in table i of the recent review
several hours before events were seen in lsd detector that could be due to a speculative emission phase preceding the ones seen in the other detectors
such events are often discarded in the analysis of data since their are object of debate
the earliest observations of optical brightening were recorded hours after neutrino s arrival
an enthusiastic description of discovery is reported in
three puzzling features concerning has set constraints on lar evolutionary models and supernova simulations
the progenitor was a blue supergiant rather than a red supergiant while type ii supernovae were thought to be produced by red supergiants
large mixing processes had transported radioactive nuclei from the deep core far into the h envelope of the progenitor and in the ejecta producing anomalous chemical abundances
the presence of three ring like geometry of the cumstellar nebula around the figure was implying a highly non spherical structure of the progenitor envelope and its winds
ious explanations have been suggested for the presence of these rings the inner one being dated years before the explosion
they might have originated by a binary merger event of that epoch showing that rotation might have played a signicant role in the dying star
however the prolate deformation of the supernova ejecta at the center of the ring system might have a very dierent origin figure
in fact the presence of large mixing and the asymmetric ejecta indicates breaking of spherical symmetry due to hydrodynamical instabilities such as the bipolar standing accretion shock instability sasi
remnant is likely not a black hole since the progenitor was light enough to be stabilised by nuclear equation of states consistent with measured neutron star masses
there is currently no sign as well of a bright pulsar as the one born from the supernova explosion in the crab nebula in
volpe printed on september neutrino observations have been used to derive constraints on fundamental physics and the properties of neutrinos axions majorons light supersymmetric particles and on unparticles
these are derived by the absence of non standard signatures by using the intrinsic neutrino signal dispersion or by the cooling time of the newborn neutron star
many such limits have been superseded by direct measurements with controlled sources on earth while other remain valuable constraints
for example from the three hours delay in the transit time of neutrinos and photons a tight limit can be on the dierence between the speed of neutrinos c and light c is obtained i
e
c
neutrinos have also conrmed the basic features of core collapse supernova predictions concerning the neutrino uence time integrated ux and spectra
from a comparative analysis of the observed neutrino events one gets as a best t point e erg and t mev for the total gravitational energy radiated in electron anti neutrinos and their ature respectively
accoding to expectations of the gravitational binding energy should be converted in e neutrinos and anti neutrinos in the several tens of mev energy range
such neutrinos are produced by pair annihilation electron capture and neutron bremstrahlung e a z e a z n n a z a z e n n n n
if one considers that ergy equipartition among the neutrino avors is rather well satised one gets about ergs and the emission time is also found to be of s
considering that the neutrino spectra are to a fairly good approximation thermal one gets for the average electron anti neutrino energy e t ing mev at the best t point
this appears currently more compatible with supernova simulations based on realistic neutrino transport although it has appeared much lower than the expected value of mev claimed for a long time
supernova neutrinos are tightly connected with two major questions in astrophysics namely what is the mechanism that makes massive stars plode and what is are the where the heavy elements are formed through the so called rapid neutron capture process or r process
nos would contribute in neutrino driven winds in core collapse supernovae accretion disks around black holes and neutron star mergers
in fact the teraction of electron neutrinos and anti neutrinos with neutrons and protons in such environments determines the neutron to proton ratio a key eter of the r process
obviously astrophysical conditions and the properties of exotic nuclei like masses decay half lives or ssion are crucial in mining the abundances
several studies have shown that neutrinos impact the neutron richness of a given astrophysical environment
finally ing their inuence still requires extensive simulations see the reviews in the volpe printed on september focus issue
various mechanisms for the sn blast are investigated including a monuclear a bounce shock a neutrino heating a magnetohydrodynamic an acoustic and a phase transition mechanisms see
since the kinetic energy in sn events goes from erg for sne up to several erg for hypernovae the explosion driving mechanism have to comply among others with providing such energies
the neutrino heating mechanism with radial hydrodynamical instabilities convective overturn with sasi appear to be a good candidate to drive iron core collapse supernova explosions while the more energetic hypernovae events could be driven by the tohydrodynamical mechanism
note that a new neutrino hydrodynamical instability termed lesa lepton number emission self sustained metry has been identied
simulations of the lighter o ne mg collapse supernovae do explode while this is not yet the case for iron core collapse ones
successful explosions for two dimensional simulations with alistic neutrino transport have been obtained for several progenitors while the rst three dimensional explosion are being obtained


neutrino avor conversion in astrophysical environments neutrino propagation in cosmological or astrophysical environments is often described using eective neutrino amplitudes the density matrix approach the path integral formalism or many body green s functions see and for a review
note that the spin formalism gives a rical representation of neutrino evolution in avor space
here we briey describe how to derive neutrino evolution equations useful for astrophysical applications based on the approximation
to this aim we use the density matrix formalism and follow the derivation in ref




the evolution equations in the mass basis at each time the spatial fourier decomposition of a dirac neutrino eld reads s s with s s b and s where we note ing to mass eigenstates i are normalized as no sum over i i t s s
the dirac spinors u i v i
volpe printed on september the standard particle and antiparticle annihilation operators in the berg picture for neutrinos of mass mi momentum and helicity s satisfy the canonical equal time anticommutation relations
s a s a i t s a and similarly for the anti particle operators
in the avor basis the eld operator is obtained as ui with u the maki nakagawa sakata pontecorvo unitary matrix
note that the indices can refer to active as well as to sterile neutrinos
in the framework of three active neutrinos the three mixing angles of u are now determined
two are almost maximal while the third one is small
the dirac and majorana cp violating phases are still unknown
the avor evolution of a neutrino or of an antineutrino in a background can be determined using one body density matrices namely expectation values of bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators h h i t where the brackets quantum and statistical average over the medium through which neutrino are propagating
for particles without mixings only diagonal elements are necessary and relations correspond to the expectation values of the number operators
if particles have mixings as is the case for neutrinos the contributions i j of and account for the coherence among the mass eigenstates
the equations employed so far to investigate avor evolution in astrophysical environments evolve the particle and anti particle tors and
however the most general description includes further correlators
first densities with wrong helicity states such as are present
these have already been shown to impact neutrino evolution in presence of magnetic elds
they also give non zero tions if non zero mass corrections are included
moreover two point correlators called abnormal or pairing densities h volpe printed on september and the hermitian conjugate also exist
equations of motion including if neutrinos are majorana them have rst been derived in ref

ticles correlators similar to can be dened as done in ref
such as or i t that violate total lepton number
the most general evolution equations for dirac or rana neutrinos evolving in an inhomogeneous medium is derived in ref

the eective most general hamiltonian takes the general b linear form h c he t where i denotes the i th component of the neutrino eld in the mass basis eq

the explicit expression of the kernel depends on the kind of teraction considered or neutral current interactions non standard interactions eective coupling to magnetic elds



it does not need to be specied to obtain the general structure of the equations but for practical applications
equations of motion for the neutrino density matrix eqs
can be obtained from the ehrenfest theorem i h h he and similarly for the other correlators
spinor products can be introduced ij t h ij t h ij t h ij t h where the fourier transform of the in eqs
is dened as
if we neglect the contribution from pair correlators it is straightforward to show that the neutrino evolution for massive neutrinos propagating in a inhomogeneous medium is determined through the liouville von neumann equations of motion for the neutrino and antineutrino density matrices i i volpe printed on september such equations become more explicit when one makes assumptions about the background
a common hypothesis of interest for applications is the one of a homogeneous unpolarised medium
such a condition correspond to where here corresponds to the particle composing the background trons neutrinos



using eqs
one gets the following evolution equations for massless neutrinos i i the equations for single particle density matrices eqs
can be rigorously derived from the exact many body description using the bogoliubov green kirkwood yvon bbgky hierarchy by truncating the hierarchy to lowest order
in absence of contributions from the trino mass the pairing correlations and magnetic moments the hamiltonian reduces to the well known form where is the vacuum contribution the second is the neutrino matter term and the last comes from neutrino self whose contribution was rst introduced by pantaleone
the explicit expressions for the matter hamiltonian is with the particle number densities e n stands for electron and neutron of the particles composing the medium nf t f t and neutrino neutrino interaction hamiltonian h
the hamiltonian for anti neutrinos is the same as for neutrinos but with a dierent sign for the vacuum part i
e

extended equations including contributions from wrong helicity note that in the case of our sun the neutrino self interaction contribution is negligible and the medium is at a good approximation homogeneous and isotropic
volpe printed on september correlators such as eq
or from pair correlators eq
can be cast in a compact matrix form i where h and r are the generalised hamiltonian and density matrix tively
if neutrinos are majorana particles in these extended equations the neutrino and anti neutrino sectors are coupled if mass netic moments or pair correlators contributions are implemented
if nos are dirac particles the wrong helicity contributions from the mass or in presence of magnetic moments couple the neutrino or anti neutrino sectors with the sterile one
with mass contributions only h is a nf nf scalar with avour and helicity structure
also the neutrino antineutrino mixing associated with the vector term of h gives a tion perpendicular to the neutrino momentum
therefore an anisotropic medium is required for such contributions to be non zero



neutrino avor conversion phenomena and open issues important progress has been achieved in our understanding of how neutrinos change their avor in massive stars a case which is much more complex than the one of our sun
the msw eect in supernovae is well established
since the star is very dense the msw resonance condition can be fullled three times for typical supernova density proles
at high density the resonance depending on takes place but does not produce any spectral modication
at lower densities two further resonances can cur that depend on and usually termed as the high resonance and the low resonances
the sign of the neutrino mass squared dierences determines if neutrinos or anti neutrinos undergo a resonant version
the sign of produces a low resonance in the neutrino sector
the one of keeps unknown the hierarchy problem
the adiabaticity of the evolution at the resonances depends also on the neutrino energy and on the gradient of the matter density which is fullled for typical power laws that accord with simulations
recent calculations have shown the emergence of new phenomena due to the neutrino neutrino interaction the presence of shock waves and of turbulence see for a review
steep changes of the stellar density prole due to shock waves induce multiple msw resonances and ence phenomena among the matter eigenstates
as a consequence the trino evolution can become completely non adiabatic when the shock passes through the msw region
as for the neutrino self interaction it can produce collective stable and unstable modes of the gas and a swapping of the neutrino volpe printed on september uxes with spectral changes
various models have been studied to tigate the impact of the self interactions on the neutrino spectra and the occurrence of collective instabilities that trigger avour modications in the star
the rst model so called bulb model was assuming that the ical and azymuthal symmetries for neutrino propagation from the neutrino sphere homogeneity and
within this model three avor version regimes are present and well understood the synchronisation the bipolar oscillations and the spectral split
for example the spectral split phenomenon is an msw eect in a comoving frame or analogous to a magnetic resonance phenomenon see and references therein
the interplay between matter and neutrino self interaction eects needs to be accurately considered
in fact matter can decohere the collective trino modes since neutrinos with dierent emission angles in the so called multiangle simulations at the neutrinosphere have dierent avor ries
it appears as for now that simulations based on realistic density proles from supernova one dimensional simulations suppress neutrino interaction eects
however this is no longer true if non stationarity and inhomogeneity is considered small scale seed perturbations can create large scale instabilities
one should keep in mind that the solution of the full dynamical problem should involve the seven dimensions t
to make the problem numerically computable the models involve various imations
these are usually non stationarity homogeneity the spherical azymuthal symmetries
however it has been shown that even if tial conditions have some symmetry the solutions of the evolution equations does not necessarily retain it
to avoid the demanding solution of the equations often the instabilities are determined by employing a linearised stability analysis see e


such analysis are useful to tify the location of the instability while they do not inform of the spectral modications
the neutrino spectral swapping turned out to be signicant in the text of the bulb model while they could well reveal minor modications in simulations including non stationarity inhomogeneities and a realistic scription of the neutrino sphere see e


for the latter ref
has in fact shown that fast conversions can occur very close to the neutrino sphere even if mixings are not taken into account
many general features are tablished but important questions remain in particular on the conditions for the occurrence of avor modications and its impact on the neutrino spectra
another open question is the role of corrections beyond the usual eld in the transition region
this is between the dense region within the the neutrino sphere is the avour and energy dependent location deep inside the star from which neutrinos start free streaming
volpe printed on september neutrinosphere which is boltzmann treated to the diluted one outside the neutrinosphere where collective avor conversion occurs
so far this sition has been treated as a sharp boundary where the neutrino uxes and spectra obtained in supernova simulations is used as initial conditions in avour studies
extended descriptions describing neutrino evolution in a dense medium have recently been derived using a coherent state path gral the born bogoliubov green kirkwood yvon hierarchy or the two particle irreducible eective action formalism see also
sides collisions two kinds of corrections in an extended tion are identied spin or helicity coherence and neutrino antineutrino pairing correlations
such corrections are expected to be tiny but the non linearity of the equations could introduce signicant changes of neutrino evolution in particular in the transition region
numerical calculations are needed to investigate the role of spin coherence or neutrino antineutrino pairing correlations or of collisions
a rst calculation in a simplied model shows that helicity coherence might have an impact
neutrino avor conversion also occurs in accretion disks around black holes and binary compact objects such as black hole neutrons star and neutron star neutron star mergers
in particular avour cation can be triggered by a cancellation of the neutrino matter and interaction contributions in these scenarios
this produces a resonant nomenon called the neutrino matter resonance
another interesting theoretical development is the establishment of nections between neutrino avor conversion in massive stars and the ics or behaviour of many body systems in other domains
using algebraic methods ref
has shown that the neutrino neutrino interaction tonian can be rewritten as a reduced bardeen cooper schrieer bcs hamiltonian for superconductivty
as mentioned above ref
has included neutrino antineutrino correlations of the pairing type which are formally analogous to the bcs correlations
the linearisation of the sponding neutrino evolution equations has highlighted the formal link tween stable and unstable collective neutrino modes and those in atomic nuclei and metallic clusters


supernova neutrino observations the observation of the neutrino luminosity curve from a future explosion would closely follow the dierent phases of the explosion ing a crucial test of supernova simulation predictions and information on the star and unknown neutrino properties
in particular the occurrence of the msw eect in the outer layer of the star and collective eects depends on the value of the third neutrino mixing angle and the neutrino mass volpe printed on september ing
the precise measurement of the last mixing angle reduces the number of unknowns
still the neutrino signal from a future supernova explosion could tell us about the mass ordering either from the early time signal in icecube or by measuring the positron time and energy signal in cherenkov or scintillator detectors associated with the passage of the shock wave in the msw region
several other properties can impact the neutrino uxes such as the neutrino magnetic moment standard interactions sterile neutrinos
cp violation eects from the dirac phase exist but appear to be small
in spite of the range of predictions the combination of future observations from detection channels with dierent avor sensitivities energy threshold and time measurements can pin down degenerate solutions and bring key information to this domain see e


the supernova early warning system snews and numerous other neutrino detectors around the world can serve as supernova neutrino vatories if a supernova blows up in the milky way or outside our galaxy
large scale detectors based on dierent technologies including liquid argon water cherenkov and scintillator are being considered
upcoming observatories are the large scale scintillator detector juno and fully the water cherenkov hyper kamiokande
these have the potential to detect neutrinos from a galactic and an extragalactic explosion as well as to discover the diuse supernova neutrino background produced from supernova explosions up to cosmological redshift of
the latter could be observed by egads i
e
the super kamiokande detector with the addition of gadolinium for a review see

ultra high energy neutrinos the main mission of high energy neutrino telescopes is to search for galactic and extra galactic sources of high energy neutrinos to elucidate the source of cosmic rays and the astrophysical mechanisms that produce them
these telescopes also investigate neutrino oscillations dark matter and pernova neutrinos for icecube
the events collected in icecube with deposited energies ranging from to pev is consistent with the discovery of high energy astrophysical neutrinos at

the pev event is the highest energy neutrino ever observed
high energy neutrino telescopes are currently also providing data on neutrino oscillations measuring atmospheric neutrinos commonly a ground for astrophysical neutrino searches
using low energy samples both antares and icecube deepcore have measured the ters and in good agreement with existing data
orca and pingu icecube extension in the gev energy range could volpe printed on september sure the mass hierarchy by exploiting the occurrence of the matter eect from neutrinos both from the msw and the parametric resonance ring in the earth
neutrino telescopes are also sensitive to other fundamental properties such as lorentz and cpt violation or sterile neutrinos
