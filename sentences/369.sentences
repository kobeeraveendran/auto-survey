v i x r a abstract relation extraction aims to identify the target lations of entities in texts
relation extraction is very important for knowledge base construction and text understanding
traditional binary relation extraction including supervised semi supervised and distant supervised ones has been extensively studied and signicant results are achieved
in cent years many complex relation extraction tasks i
e
the variants of simple binary relation tion are proposed to meet the complex applications in practice
however there is no literature to fully investigate and summarize these complex relation extraction works so far
in this paper we rst port the recent progress in traditional simple binary relation extraction
then we summarize the ing complex relation extraction tasks and present the denition recent progress challenges and portunities for each task
introduction relation extraction re is one of the fundamental tasks in information extraction and it benets a lot of natural guage processing tasks such as question answering text derstanding
re is also a core step in the entire edge base construction pipeline
traditional re tasks riedel et al
aim to identify the correct relation between two entities from texts
for ample we hope to extract the relational fact beijing capital of china from the following text beijing formerly romanized as peking is the capital of the people s republic of china
traditional re tasks mainly focus on the binary relation tween two entities
we refer to these tasks as binary relation extraction bire for short and they usually take based solutions
according to the problem settings the ditional bire tasks are roughly divided into three categories supervised bire semi supervised bire distant supervised bire
specically supervised bire focuses on the learning of a re model from a set of high quality labeled data
however high quality labeled data is difcult and costly to be obtained while unlabeled data is widely available
semi supervised bire thus is proposed to train models with only a small set of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data
another effort to alleviate the difculty of data labeling is distant pervision
distant supervised bire aims to learn a reliable re model based on a set of weakly labeled samples
the bels are obtained automatically in a heuristic way and usually contain a lot of noises
simple bires dominate the current research in information extraction
in the early days feature engineering and based methods are the focus of the research in supervised and distant supervised bire
bootstrapping was usually used in semi supervised bire where the relation instances and terns are iteratively extracted based on a small set of seed stances
in recent years with the development of deep ing many advanced neural models e

bert transformer capsule networks are applied to re tasks
in general simple bire has made signicant progress and many effective solutions have been used in practice
ever as intelligent applications fast grow simple bire not meet the needs of these applications
we elaborate the limitations of simple bire and introduce more complex re tasks to solve these limitations
first simple bire depends on large amounts of data
however it is difcult to obtain enough labeled or unlabeled noisy data in many scenarios which fails existing supervised semi supervised distant supervised re models
to solve this problem the task of few shot relation extraction was proposed which focuses on building effective models with just a few samples
some few shot learning algorithms e

metric learning based han and zhu are proven to be effective for this task
second simple bire is limited to sentence level extraction
simple bire mainly focuses on the relation between an tity pair mentioned in a single sentence
instead many other sources beyond sentences contain more rich semantic relation instances
how to extract relations from various sources is an interesting and challenging problem
specically many entity pairs appear in multiple sentences in a ument which can not be extracted by simple bire els
this motivates document level extraction
most works on bire only focus on monolingual e
g chinese or english
but many entities are tioned in multiple languages indicating that it is ble to identify the relation using texts of different guages
cross lingual relation extraction is thus posed
in addition to texts other modal e

image video formation is also useful for expressing certain tic relations
for example image is good at expressing the spatial relations
multi modal relation extraction is proposed to use multi modal information for re
third binary modeling in bire is far from satisfying the requirements of some complex applications
the ships of entities in the world are very complicated
binary relation in general is not enough to model the complicated semantics of real world and more complicated relation eling is needed
in some scenarios we have to identify the relations volving multiple entities i
e
n ary relation extraction
n ary relation extraction aims to extract relations among n entities in the context of one or more sentences
n ary re is very useful for document level reading hension and supportive for question answering or ment classication
categorizing relations into different granularities is cial for some tasks such as building taxonomy
multi grained relation extraction aims to jointly extract multi grained relations from texts
many relational facts only hold true under certain ditions
conditional relation extraction aims to extract relations with certain constrains e

temporal or spatial conditions which are very important for complex cations
for example we know the fact obama ident united states is only valid during
if this fact is used for knowledge based question ing today it may have serious political implications
some facts can be expressed in a nested way
nested relation extraction is proposed to extract this kind of knowledge
fourth the existing bire can not handle the overlapping entities well
for another example the former sentence beijing formerly romanized as peking


contains three facts beijing the capital of china beijing the same as peking and peking the capital of china
however tional bire tends to extract these facts independently which losses much potential supervision information
to model this property the task of overlapping re is proposed where one or two entities in two facts are overlapped
in this paper we refer to the re tasks mentioned above as complex re
the contents of this paper contain two parts
the rst part sec presents the summary of the traditional bires
besides the challenges and directions in bire are also concluded
the second part sec introduces the plex re tasks including the denition example and the cent progress
besides we also present the research lenges and opportunities for these complex re tasks
we hope this survey will help researchers to understand the latest progress challenges and opportunities of the sub tasks in re
binary relation extraction simple binary relation extraction bire has been extensively in general bire can be studied for many years
rized into supervised semi supervised distant supervised paradigms

supervised bire description
supervised bire focuses on the learning of a re model based on a set of high quality labeled ples
these samples are widely obtained by manual tation or careful crowdsourcing
each sample is formalized as t st r where t is an entity pair
st is a tence containing t and it expresses the labeled relation r
a supervised bire model accepts t as inputs and predicts the proper relation r for entity pair t as the output
recent works
in recent years deep learning has been extensively used in re tasks and many novel neural models are proposed
we highlight typical efforts in this direction
neural graph based models
graph based methods have been successfully applied to re and obtain high performance
for example zhang and qi rst applied graph convolutional network gcn to re
pre training based methods
pre trained models e

bert and xlnet can encode a given text into its proper distribution representation i
e
text zhao et al
constructs entity pair graphs ding
combined with the semantic features from bert
capsule network based methods
for example zhang et al
takes capsule network with an attention based routing algorithm to deal with the label problem in re
soat results
the commonly used datasets in supervised bire include task ace and
we present the state of the art results of task in table
model macro tre r bert epgnn


table the soat results on task
all the results are from zhao et al


semi supervised bire description
in many scenarios rich labeled data is difcult to be obtained but a lot of unlabeled data is available
to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data in the training stage semi supervised bire tries to learn from both labeled data and unlabeled data
formally speaking we denote the pre dened set of and tions as r a set of labeled data as sl xi
uib
no public
html
ldc
upenn
edu
stanford
edu projects a set of unlabeled data as su where yi r and nl or nu is the corresponding data size
semi supervised bire aims to learn a function f sl su r that models both the labeled and unlabeled data and predicts the target relation r for
recent works
as a main branch of semi supervised bire bootstrapping starts from some labeled seed instances and learn a preliminary model which is used to nd more labeled instances
many works also focus on ing semantic drift problem in bootstrapping
for example carlson et al
adds constrains to the training dure by coupling many extractors for different categories and relations
with the exploration of teacher student models in supervised learning luo et al
introduces this tecture into semi supervised bire where students learn a bust representation from unlabeled data and teachers guide students with labeled data
some other works also utilize multi task learning by jointly learning semi supervised bire task with other tasks
soat results
it is hard to fairly compare different supervised bire models
this is because many strapping approaches are deployed in an open world setting and extract relations on the web
semi supervised ting varies greatly between methods i
e
the level of vision the data size of unlabeled data and the evaluation rics can not be exactly the same in different methods
for these reasons we do not provide the sota here
in eral semi supervised bire has made great progress in recent years and many mature systems e

dipre snowball and knowitall have been applied to some structured knowledge acquisition tasks in practice

distant supervised bire description
similar to supervised bire each sample in tant supervised bire can also be formalized as t st r
the difference is that these samples are constructed in an matic way e

aligning knowledge base with text corpora riedel et al

the strong assumption in sample sition makes the samples in distant supervised bire contain lots of noisy relation labels
in other words s may weakly or not express the labeled relation r
as a result the main focus of research in distant supervised bire is how to alleviate the impact of noise on performance
recent works
we highlight several popular directions in recent years
the idea of reinforcement learning has been widely used in noise detection
for example sun et al
takes policy network to detect the noisy labels and further to obtain the latent correct labels
the adversarial training is also proven to be effective in improving the robustness of the re model on the noisy samples liu et al

various attention mechanisms are also proposed to learn the important features or instances among the noisy ples li et al

besides some other techniques are also applied to noise detection e

soft constraints of entity types variant cnn non iid assumption noise label converter and so on
soat results
the commonly used benchmark for tant supervised bire is nyt riedel et al
which is constructed by aligning triples in freebase with texts in new york times
we report the soat results in table
model att seg auc


table the soat results on nyt where all the results are from li et al

auc denotes the area under the precision recall curve

challenges and directions of bire although simple bire has made great progress in recent years there are still some challenges
reliability of benchmarks
a reliable benchmark can be measured from two aspects scale and quality
that is a good benchmark should contain large scale and quality test samples
however the two conditions not be easy simultaneously satised in bire tasks
for example in supervised bire the scale of the test set is usually very small
how to obtain reliable benchmarks is a promising direction
reliability of model learning
because of the various factors

limited data or noise the precise tic features of relations are still difcult to be captured
with the development of machine learning technology e

pre training transfer learning this problem can be alleviated to some extent
but learning a highly reliable bire model is still an important direction
sparse detection in applications
in real applications we usually pre dene a set of relations r and then tract their instances from massive candidate entity pairs
however there are countless semantic relations in the world and most of the candidate entity pairs to be cessed have no relation in r
how to detect the correct instances from a huge collection is a big challenge and we refer to it as sparse detection
fortunately there are some benchmarks to model this property
for example nyt contains relation na that denotes there is no lation in the relation set
but to the best of our edge there is no re model that performs very well on sparse detection
complex relation extraction there are only very recent works around complex relation extraction core
different from conventional bire core tries to extract more complex relations that involve ple entities or under certain constrains
in this section we present the denition and investigate the recent progress for each complex re task
we also conclude the challenges of each task

few shot relation extraction in most cases a relation only has fewer instances which makes the traditional supervised re models powerless
as a new paradigm few shot learning tends to be effective for this problem i
e
few shot re
follows be han and zhu
given a set of relations r with n relations a supporting set s is denoted as few shot re formalized can as s


xn


rn xn rn


xn mn rn where r is the i th relation
xi j is a sentence with an entity pair that is labeled with relation ri
few shot re aims to learn a function f s r and predicts the proper relation y for the unlabeled sample
learning algorithms on this dataset
han and zhu proposes a new few shot re dataset fewrel
they also implemented the recent soat shot fewrel
gao et al
is a more challenging few shot dataset which aims to study the problem of new domain tion under few instances
considering the noise in shot re gao et al
proposes a hybrid based prototypical network to extract informative features
soares et al
takes bert to learn the distributional similarity between two sentences where the entity pair in the sentence is replaced by a blank symbol
there are two challenges or directions for few shot re relative importance of samples since there is only a few instances for each relation it is very necessary to learn from other relation instances when learning tic features of a target relation
as a result the relative importance of an instance to the target relation should be learned otherwise the noise instance will be introduced
is knowledge reasoning needed as han and zhu points out the relation diction in a large number of samples need deep reasoning beyond the text in the sample
for example given the sentence han and zhu he was a professor at reed college where he taught steve jobs and replaced lloyd j
reynolds as the head of the calligraphy gram
the logical reasoning with common sense is needed to infer the relational fact steve jobs educated at reed college

document relation extraction document relation extraction aims to extract relations in this task the tween entity mentions at document level
relation mentions can span multiple sentences and even graphs
these properties make the problem more challenging compared to intra sentence relation extraction
in the real world case of re the data to be processed is ten in document form which requires re model of level or inter sentence rather than intra sentence
until cently methods like song et al
sahu et al
pear and accelerate the development of inter sentence re tasks
all of these methods can be used to enrich the edge base
peng et al
rst presents graph based lstm model to solve re in multiple sentences
they build two rected acyclic graphs based on the word dependencies and then utilize lstm to learn the hidden presentations
song et al
further improves the model and introduce a graph state lstm model which can keep whole graph formation and has high efcacy in training and decoding sahu al
uses ve type edges to build the steps
document level graph and learn presentation by a labeled edge gcnn model
bi afne layer aggregates all entity tions and generates the nal relation prediction
the main difculties in document re are as follows diversity of document format the document can be in a variety of formats
the rst task is to transform the original data le like pdf to the specic format like txt
some important information can be lost in this step and make it harder to conduct re process
long dependencies cross sentences relation mentions can span long distance in the document
traditional cnn and rnn based networks fail to capture those tures in longer sequences

cross lingual relation extraction cross lingual re seeks to learn an extractor trained in the resource rich language and transfers it to the target language
the cross lingual re also takes the sentence as well as entity mentions as input and outputs the relation between the given entity pair
cross lingual re is benecial to the knowledge base pletion because some entities may appear more frequently in corpus of a certain language
considering the lack of annotated data it will inevitably lose a lot of informative facts that could not be extracted based on the resource poor guage
cross lingual re can address this drawback exactly
at an early age cross lingual re methods depend on parallel corpora and then conduct extraction by projecting et al
the source language to the target one
solves the problems with the help of translation nism
when cross lingual word embedding was proposed ni and florian utilizes it to map source embeddings subburathinam et al
rst builds text to the target
features by universal dependency parsing tools and then adopts gcn to learn the hidden presentations in the shared semantic space in which the re of both languages can be conducted
although there are many methods of cross lingual re main challenges are as follows gaps between languages the gaps between languages are quite different
whether some shared features are useful universally is still a question
applicable in practice the proposed state of the art models do not achieve the satisfactory outcome that the best performance of score is around
due to the relatively low performance it is not reliable to use in practice

multi modal relation extraction with the explosive growth of information from internet ages and videos also become rich resource
multi modal re take the advantage of these large scale corpus and focus on extracting relations from them
as a vivid way to convey information images and videos can implicate much knowledge
on the one hand humans are like to express some common sense knowledge using images rather than explicitly saying it
on the other hand ing multi modal corpus has shown promising results in many tasks
this phenomena highlights the importance of ing relations from images or videos rather than just free text
introduced a never ending image learner neil for visual knowledge from internet
neil cluster images from websites and mining relationships tween instances
based on recently proposed visual tion answering vqa datasets multi modal re like object or object attribute relations also aroused wide cern
chen et al
multi modal re is still a research hotspot and have many interesting problems to focus on generality of knowledge relation extracted by existing works is highly related to given input e

the ball in the picture is red
these knowledge is shallow and hard to be utilized in further study
how to extract tive but informative relation e

common sense edge is one of the ultimate goals of multi modal re
multi modal kb although researches have begun to construct multi modal kbs there is still a big gap tween it and existing kbs

n ary relation extraction n ary relation extraction nre aims to extract relations among n entities in the context of one or more sentences
in the nre task the input can be denoted as e t where e


en contains all the entity mentions and t


sm is the given text containing m sentences m
the target is to predict the relation among those n entities
the relation set is pre dened and represented as r


rk where na is also included in r noting there is no relation among the n entities
for example given the text the deletion mutation on of egfr gene was present in patients while the point mutation on was noted in
all patients were treated with getinib and showed a partial sponse
peng et al
the entity mentions egfr form the relation of drug gene mutation
n ary re has attracted more research interests
it plays a crucial role in applications such as detecting cause effect and predicting drug gene mutation facts
in contrast to the prosperity of the binary re there are fewer methods posed for n ary re task
mcdonald et al
studies the case in biomedical domain where the n ary relation is pressed within a single sentence
recently some exciting work song et al
has appeared in the task of named entity recognition
these methods can well handle the sentence n ary re
peng et al
explores a general re framework based on graph lstm
they rst transform the text input to graph by regarding the words as nodes and the dependencies links between adjacent words and inter sentence relations as edges
secondly the graph is separated into two dags from which they utilize an extended tree lstm network to learn the text presentations in the third step
song et al
propose a graph state lstm model that can learn better presentation of the input text during the recurrent graph state transition
with increasing numbers of recurrent steps each word can capture more information from a larger context
there is still some suffering in n ary re
lack of data there is no well annotated data for ating n ary re specially
the currently used benchmark dataset in peng et al
and song et al
is constructed based on distant supervision and has only one ternary relation
absence of end to end model most of the preliminary works require all the entity mentions as input but taining them can be demanding
in real applications an end to end model can make a vast difference

multi grained relation extraction multi grained relation describes knowledge in a coarse ne manner
intuitively ne grained relation aims to guish subordinate level relations from a coarse grained tion
categorizing relations into different levels is crucial for building taxonomy mining level specic information
the performance gains from multi grained information have been demonstrated in many tasks
multi grained tions via categories can provide additional supervision from annotated data wu et al

by learning multi grained topics of documents chen et al
further improves the performance of short text classication
however multi grained re attracted little attention from the community recently
xia et al
proposes a grained named entity recognition framework to tackle the overlapping and nested problem
there are several possible reasons for the slow progress of multi grained re fuzzy boundary the boundary between coarse grained and ne grained relations is not clear
existing works almost regard two type relations as a whole part which leads to a bottleneck of performance
fairness of evaluation metrics the naive ment is not sufcient for multi grained re and sponding evaluation metrics are needed for better reect the quality in a multi grained manner

conditional relation extraction conditional re aims to extract relations with certain strains

temporal or spatial conditions
a conditional lation can be generally denoted as s p o c where s p o
overlapping relation extraction different relational triples in a sentence may have different zeng et al
concludes two degree overlap
ping types entity pair overlap epo and single entity overlap seo
epo means some triplets share overlapping entity pairs
seo means some triplets share an overlapped entity but they do nt share overlapped entity pair
for ample president of and born in are seo which share the same entity
born in and live in belong to epo which share the same entity pair
the previous re was designed to nd relation based on given entity pairs
however in actual applications the tion of entities is often unknown and there may be multiple relationships between entities
ignoring overlapping re will lose many related triples leading to incomplete knowledge graphs
some researchers are now studying how to consider lapping relations in a sentence
copyr zeng et al
adopts an end to end neural model with copy mechanism to extract overlapping relations which is the rst work ering overlap problems
takanobu et al
designs a erarchical paradigm which incorporates reinforcement ing to extract overlapping relations
but there are still some challenges in overlapping ship extraction
complexity of relations there may be no relationship or multiple relationships between two entities in a tence
unknown entities and relationships the locations of entities and relationships are unknown and it is difcult to nd them correctly
conclusion relation extraction denotes a series of tasks that aim to identify the proper relations for two or more entities der specic settings
in this paper we summarize the est progress of simple binary re tasks including supervised semi supervised and distant supervised re
furthermore we also investigate the more complex re tasks including the denition recent progress challenges and opportunities
relationship extraction research is an eternal proposition which mainly benets from the advances in natural language processing and machine learning
we argue that the existing progress made in simple bire can also be transferred to the complex re tasks
mature applications for complex re are still far away
we hope this survey make researchers quickly understand the concepts and research progress of each task in complex re
is the original subject property object triple and c is the dition to hold relation true
take temporal condition as an example the relation presidentof barack hussein obama american only holds true over the temporal period to
so the condition can be a temporal interval here
nowadays large scale kb contains millions of entity and relation instances such as dbpedia freebase and yago
however few of them consider relation as conditioned or include the above mentioned external condition in the kb
it heavily limits the applicability of existing kb to cated reasoning task and leads to an urgent need for research in conditional re
in the early stage pattern based methods combined with manually designed features are adopted to capture the tion
uses regular expressions to extract temporal and spatial relations from wikipedia infobox
liu et al
try to generate patterns for time variant relations
some machine learning approaches are also tried in medical eld gurulingappa et al

preliminary works have been attempted but there is still no good solution
the main challenges are as follows complexity of dependencies the complex cies between entities relation and its condition make it hard to handle different part properly
flexibility of condition condition in free text may have many existing forms
a general framework is needed to formalize the conditional dimension
lack of data there is no well annotated data for tional re yet
to some extent it prevents using end end model for this task

nested relation extraction traditional bire can be expressed as rel while nested re can be formalized as rel or rel
however traditional nary re will lose some information resulting in incomplete and uninformative triples
nested re helps to express the meaning of the original sentence more correctly
in addition nested re will be more benecial to downstream tasks such as question answering that relies heavily on the correctness and completeness of triples
some recent works try to study nested re
nestie bhutani et al
learns syntactic patterns for the lations that are expressed as nested templates
stuffie prasojo et al
exploits stanford dependency parsing and lexical databases to extract nested relations
however the existing works are not good enough mainly because of the following challenges complexity of structure sentences consist of many clauses or there are many entities and nested ships
sentence structure is often very complex and it is difcult to analyze nested structures directly
implicit subject in a sentence the subject may appear only once most of which are in the form of a reference him he and the corresponding real entity needs to be found
