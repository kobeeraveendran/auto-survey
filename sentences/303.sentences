cz may abstract we present a review of the problem of asteroid shape and spin reconstruction from generalised jections i
e
from lightcurves disk resolved images occultation silhouettes radar range doppler data and interferometry
the aim of this text is to summarize all important mathematical facts and proofs related to this inverse problem to describe their implications to observers and modellers and to provide the reader with all relevant references
introduction the title combines astronomy and mathematics in three ways while our application is asteroid elling generalised projections are the mathematical concept that denes the data we use and models from means that we are dealing with mathematical inverse problems
make no mistake while the data are obtained by near automatic instruments and the analysis of the data can now be carried out largely by software tools made for this purpose it s not just machines
some basic mathematical understanding of the problem is always required as well even if the calculations methods and principles are hidden in the software
creating a model that ts the data is not the same as understanding and solving the inverse problem
this is why we have written this brief history and review of asteroid models from inversion techniques that are demonstrably exact well founded and well established explaining the main points and leaving details to the references
there are hundreds of papers related to this problem eld by now so one can easily lose track of the basic principles
the main point is that this is a mathematical rather than merely computational problem
this text concerns the shape and spin and some surface istics of asteroids mathematical modelling of the insides of asteroids from in situ radio data is a newer topic described in e

pursiainen and kaasalainen
by now the theory and practice of inverse problems of generalised projections gps is well tablished so asteroid modelling rests on a solid mathematical basis
gps are in short integrals over parts of the surface of a three dimensional body that correspond to various types of observational data kaasalainen and lamberg
they generalise the concept of a projection in a given direction houette to various forms such as photographic or radar images
in instrumental sense quanta from the surface are integrated over time to form a quantitative reading
what the integral of a gp looks like depends on the instrument
here we discuss three classes of gps in three sections i lightcurves images and silhouettes and radar and interferometry
lightcurves
shape in its simplest form a gp is the apparent brightness of a body when illuminated from some direction and viewed from another
the observable at dierent geometries as a function of time is called a lightcurve the corresponding gp integral is over the visible and illuminated part of the surface taking into account its light scattering properties
if the brightness gp is known for several geometries can the shape of the body be inferred from these this is a fundamental mathematical problem
or rather an inverse problem computing the brightness of a known surface is quite straightforward whereas the inverse direction is something else
is there a unique answer even if yes what happens to the result if the data are noisy or sparse or we are not sure how the surface scatters light the rst step towards the solution of the inverse problem was given in russell for a modern version see kaasalainen et al
if the viewing and illumination directions are the same the inverse problem does not have a unique answer
about half of the information needed for reconstructing the shape is inevitably lost so there is no chance of a decent solution
russell assumed geometric scattering i
e
brightness directly proportional to the area of the silhouette which is roughly the case for dark surfaces in kaasalainen et al
it was shown that the same nonuniqueness applies to e

diuse bright surfaces but in fact concerning the other half of the shape information
since russell s geometry was assumed to be a good approximation of realistic asteroid observations the result stopped the study of the inverse problem for almost a century
approximations by xed shapes such as ellipsoids were supposed to be the only thing one can get out of brightness data magnusson et al

the inverse problem was shown to be uniquely solvable in kaasalainen and kaasalainen et al
interestingly group theoretical tools employed in quantum mechanics turned out to be necessary for the proof
the uniqueness requires separate viewing and illumination directions obviously the larger the separation phase angle the better
the uniqueness proof requires an assumption of a convex surface to facilitate general analytical the scattering behaviour however is not especially restricted as long as the intrinsic darkness or albedo is uniform
what is more the inverse problem is actually rather stable moderate errors in the data or the assumed scattering cause only moderate rather than drastic changes in the inferred shape
this is called minkowski stability since the solution requires the solution of the minkowski problem that is very stable lamberg
one version of the problem is if the areas of the facets of a convex polyhedron are known is the shape unique minkowski proved that it is and provably robust shape reconstruction procedures are described in e

kaasalainen et al
lamberg and lamberg and kaasalainen
once the uniqueness was assured the next step was to see what happens with real data
as is typical for many cases not all the methods used in the proof were directly suitable for actual inversion
both convex and nonconvex shapes were used in numerical inversion in kaasalainen et al
the former for the proven uniqueness and the latter for generality despite the ambiguities
a robust practical procedure based on nonlinear optimisation to nd the rotational properties of the target and solving for the facet areas of a polyhedron representation and then applying the minkowski procedure is given in kaasalainen et al
and available as software at database of asteroid models from inversion techniques damit durech et al

indeed the convex version turned out to be minkowski stable in practice and even less than ten good lightcurves from at least a few dierent geometries provide enough data for a unique model
in fact the explanatory level of convex inversion turned out to be too good in a sense it seems that practically all lightcurves of known asteroids can be explained well with convex shapes
there are only few exceptions known out of over a thousand asteroids
so while the fundamental nonuniqueness independent of the illumination phase angle and some uniqueness properties of convex solutions are proven in viikinkoski et al
and kaasalainen

troja

cz projects solution was reassuringly stable it turned out that there is a considerable limit to the detail one can infer from lightcurves
the information limit was estimated in durech and kaasalainen
even if there are quite large nonconvex features on the surface they usually have no unique signature for most realistic geometries the solar phase angle should be several tens of degrees of arc only near earth asteroids can be observed at such geometries before a convex shape can not explain the data
thus in most cases nonconvex models simply can not be more than an artist s vision even though they look more realistic than a convex shape
this is a pity since nonconvex inversion is actually easier technically than the convex one see the nonconvex methods and models in kaasalainen et al
viikinkoski et al
also available at damit
the features of a nonconvex solution may look temptingly similar to those of probe visited targets but this is because the shape representation usually interpolates between surface points in a natural manner e

by rendering a at region seen in a convex solution as a smooth valley
this of course does not mean that the feature is based on any actual information if the convex model ts the data as well
in mathematical sense the convex version of the inverse problem is not very ill posed the answer is unique and all that is needed to assure a stable solution is a positivity constraint and moderate isation to ensure a feasibility constraint
computation and convergence are also very fast
on the other hand the nonconvex version has inherent ambiguities viikinkoski et al
kaasalainen quires regularisation for stability and usually can not be guaranteed in any sense to be correct in its features and details
of course few asteroids are exactly convex so a convex solution inherently warns us of the same information limit in most cases we can only infer coarse global scale shape properties
further corroboration is provided by ground truth the accurate shape models from space probe data asteroids such as eros gaspra and itokawa
lightcurves computed from these models do not t the observed ones as well as those from convex inversion models
this is essentially due to systematic errors in data and the scattering model that is never known accurately kaasalainen and durech in any case it emphasises the fundamental resolution limit of brightness data
many of the concepts above can be conveniently examined in the simplistic two dimensional context ostro and connelly kaasalainen
this is not useful for real world problems as such but the importance of the illumination phase angle and the essence of minkowski stability can be explained very compactly
indeed a main point in interpreting brightness mostly due to the shape rather than albedo changes is not just that this is realistic as seen from probe images but that the solution is much more stable
signicant albedo changes can be inferred from brightness data in which case this can be modelled as a spot in a d shape model e

psyche viikinkoski et al

such models are not unique for example one can always make a spot area sharper and brighter the opposite end more blunt and darker
the existence and estimate of albedo variegation is deduced in the complete modelling process
strong asymmetry of a single lightcurve may imply an albedo spot only if the data are from zero solar phase angle


implications for observers solar phase angle a convex shape model can be uniquely reconstructed only if the viewing and in practice illumination geometries are not the same i
e
when the solar phase angle is not zero
lightcurve inversion works well up to the distance of jupiter trojans with heliocentric distances of about au where the maximum phase angle is
for more distant populations of small bodies observed from earth the solar phase angle is always too small to enable shape reconstruction from lightcurves
for probing and sampling the shape solutions nonconvex codes are not practical since each code depends on its choice of shape representation support regularisation for smoothness
and the corresponding setups see sect
viikinkoski and kaasalainen viikinkoski et al

there is no comprehensively coverable nonconvex shape class in the same sense that there is a convex class it is approximated by a collection of quite separate classes
each class and setup chooses its solution
relative vs
absolute photometry for the purpose of shape reconstruction absolute photometry is always better than just relative lightcurves with unknown zero point
however most lightcurve vations come in form of relative data
this is no problem for the inversion scale factors for individual lightcurves shifts in magnitude scale are free nuisance parameters of the optimization
the tage of relative lightcurves is that the shape uncertainty along the rotation axis is large
an extreme example would be observation of straight line lightcurves in which case we can not tell how attened the spheroid is
also with long period rotation when the full lightcurve can not be observed in a single night relative lightcurves provide poor information about the amplitude
colours tained from the inversion as ratios between scale factors for lightcurves in dierent colours
if we have calibrated observations in dierent colours the colour indices can be easily observation noise the random noise is not really an issue as long as it is not large very curate lightcurves can not give a more detailed model cf
our photometric laboratory asteroid in kaasalainen et al
with lightcurve accuracy of order

the laboratory asteroid shows the ground truth and proves that a model with certainly wrong light scattering properties nevertheless is a good one minkowski stability and can t the data exactly so the accurate data do not increase resolution
one should keep in mind that there is always a shape albedo ambiguity present so any attempts to reconstruct shape details are apart from other eects inevitably limited by the tion of light scattering properties being constant over the surface

spin so far we have discussed the shape solution
with asteroids one must simultaneously solve for the spin i
e
the period the pole ecliptic latitude and longitude
precessing asteroids or time dependent ods are a straightforward extension of this kaasalainen kaasalainen et al
so we only sider the majority class of xed spin targets
many of these have orbits close to the earth s orbital plane that place them in the domain of the degree spin longitude ambiguity kaasalainen and lamberg
it means that for geometry restricted to one plane the coordinates of the sun and earth in the asteroid frame are exactly the same for the original asteroid and such the is mirrored along its equatorial plane its pole longitude is and its initial rotation is
in practice this aects the spin latitude and shape estimates as well but usually not very much
this fundamental ambiguity concerns all data integrated over the whole surface regardless of the wavelength
it applies to any process history or sequence of disk integrated data regardless of the orbital positions if it occurs at the planar geometry
thus e

thermal infrared can not resolve this ambiguity
this is in fact the only nontrivial spin ambiguity
for completeness let us prove that the spin solution is unique for non planar viewing geometries theorem
for extensive geometry coverage there is only one shape and spin combination that matches the data assuming a non spheroidal shape and nonzero spin
proof
first we note that the planar ambiguity is the only condition of invariance of reproduced data with a simple transformation of the essentially invariant shape
this is seen from the three rotation matrices corresponding to each spin angle kaasalainen and lamberg
the sinusoidal elements of the matrices do not allow further simple mimicking transformations
in the trivial case of zero spin a constant rotation phase matrix there is an innite variety of rotated but otherwise similar shapes that match the data
in the uniqueness proof of shape we assumed innitely dense accurate and full coverage of vations since that is the only way of having an exact proof without haggling about the setup accuracy and number of observations those belong to the realm of stability not uniqueness which always assumes ideal conditions
but with rotation the concept of ideal coverage is not so easily dened independent of the measurement setup
let us rst assume that we have a system that records the brightness from all directions around the rotating target in an instant compared to the rotation rate
the information from one instant is sucient to determine the shape separately
then we need only one more instant to infer the spin properties assuming the instants are within one half of the rotation period
since the shapes are the same up to a three dimensional rotation requiring three euler angles and one euler angle is the rotation around the target s axis we immediately get the unique pole direction from two euler gles and the period from the third rotation angle when we align the shapes to coincide
or consider another case we have not determined the shape but the geometries have revealed a direction in which the lightcurve is at
then it must necessarily be parallel to the rotation axis
of course this is not very helpful in practice where the whole time series depends on the orbital geometries even if we have innite time
in practice the spin information is strong since rotation is very constraining
if we have lightcurves from a few geometries not close to each other the correct spin solution stands out from local minima in the goodness comparison
the determination of the spin axis direction is also not aected by the shape albedo ambiguity
the number of points is not that crucial if there are suciently many geometries successful version though obviously crude for shape can be carried out for very sparse photometry
the strong constraints of the model make it possible to solve for the period spin and shape with sampling cies orders of magnitude lower than the usual nyquist criterion kaasalainen durech et al
durech and hanus
this is the most important modelling mode for asteroids since useful data can be obtained from hundreds of thousands of targets from large sky surveys much more than can ever be individually targeted
if the brightness data are so scarce that no models of single targets can be made one can still infer statistically meaningful distributions of some spin and shape characteristics in large object populations
the crude but analytical and provably unique model is based on the variation levels of extensive sets of brightness measurements nortunen et al
kaasalainen and durech
the underlying assumption is that such sets cover the required observing geometries widely and densely enough
the approach is mathematically quite new potentially introducing a new class of inverse problems
models can also be constructed from combined sets of data obtained at various wavelengths
with thermal infrared and optical data this can be used to infer surface characteristics from thermal models delbo et al
durech et al
and other infrared lightcurves can safely be combined with optical data as the dierences between lightcurves at dierent wavelengths are small enough in view of the obtainable resolution durech et al



implications for observers spin and period as mentioned above several lightcurves observed under suciently dierent tries are enough to uniquely reconstruct the shape and spin state
what does it mean in practice for near earth asteroids that come close to earth the geometry usually changes a lot during the encounter so it is in principle possible to reconstruct the model from a single apparition
for main belt asteroids we usually have to wait several years to collect data from at least two or three apparitions to cover the geometry
another practical issue is the determination of the sidereal rotation period
the local minima in the period parameter space are separated by about
where p is the rotation period and t is the interval covered by observations kaasalainen
so with any inversion algorithm we have to make sure that the global minimum is found otherwise the spin and shape solution may be wrong even if the dierence between the periods for local and global minimum is small
with a gradient based approach this is done by starting the optimization at dense enough set of initial periods on the whole interval of possible values
the range can be estimated by nding the synodic rotation period and its uncertainty fourier analysis
with sparse in time photometry the sampling is sparse with respect to p and we do not have any initial estimate of the period
then the interval has to cover all physically realistic values from the spin barrier limit of two hours up to hundreds or thousand hours
pole ambiguity in reality the geometry is not strictly coplanar and data are not ideal so the shapes corresponding to and poles are not exactly mirrored versions of each other
if such shapes are then used to t thermal infrared data one of them can t signicantly better that the other and this can lead to an incorrect conclusion that the ir data resolved the ambiguity
however this might be just because shapes from lightcurves are slightly dierent and thermophysical modelling is sensitive to shape details hanus et al

an example is asteroid bohlinia for which delbo and tanga showed that one pole solution is signicantly better than the other
however given the low orbital inclination of only about this was caused just by random variations of the shape rather than by breaking the degeneracy
also note that ambiguity has nothing to do with the prograde retrograde ambiguity in pole direction which is usually caused by insucient data
light scattering model in theory the scattering properties of the surface can be reconstructed gether with the shape theorem
in practice the scattering model is rather simple and often xed
with relative lightcurves we do not have any information of how the brightness changes with solar phase angle as the phase angle is almost constant for individual lightcurves
with absolute lightcurves or ibrated sparse photometry that cover a wide range of phase angles it is necessary to t also the phase curves
this can be done either by using a physical light scattering model hapke or lumme bowell for example or a simpler mathematical model an exponential linear phase function multiplied by a combination of lomell seeliger and lambert scattering kaasalainen et al
for example
an advantage of this model is that it separates the phase dependent part and the other part that depends only on illumination and emission angles
so with sparse data or absolute lightcurves all phase parameters are tted while with relative lightcurves the phase dependent part is held constant
if the data do not cover low phase angles the exponential part can be set to zero and only the linear part is tted
the phase angle behaviour is usually assumed to be the same for all data i
e
the coecients are the same independently on lter
however due to the phase reddening eect accurate photometry can reveal dierences in phase curves for dierent colors and this requires separate parameters for dierent colours
relative calibrated absolute photometry by absolute photometry we mean that the brightness is known in absolute ux units
this is not needed in practice because without the knowledge about the asteroid size there is always size reectance ambiguity that can not be solved with optical data only
so absolute photometry is needed only when optical photometry is combined with thermal infrared measurements and the model is scaled to real size with a realistic scattering model delbo et al
durech et al

for the purpose of lightcurve inversion calibrated photometry is sucient i
e
for a subset of lightcurves or data points we have information about their common zero point so they are internally calibrated
if there are more subsets with dierent zero points they are arbitrarily shifted on magnitude scale
an example are observations in dierent lters
sparse in time data typically cover a wide interval of phase angles they have to be internally calibrated and the phase function coecients have to be tted
with relative photometry only the shape of the lightcurve is know not its brightness with respect to other lightcurves so there is less information see sect



nevertheless relative lightcurves are what we usually have to deal with
yorp when talking about spin in sect

we assumed that asteroid rotation could be described as rotation around a xed spin axis with a constant rotation rate
however rotation state of asteroids is aected by solar radiation and anisotropic thermal radiation from the surface
if the net torque does not cancel out when averaged over the surface rotation and orbit then it leads to a secular change of the rotation period and the spin axis direction an eect know as yarkovsky okeefe radzievskii paddack yorp eect
the yorp induced change of rotation rate can be directly observed as a change of the rotation period lowry et al
taylor et al
or as a change of the rotation phase accumulated over long time kaasalainen et al

the yorp eect can be easily included into the model as an additional parameter describing the linear change of the rotation frequency with time
yorp also changes the direction of spin axis but these changes are so slow that they can not be detected from current data
tumbling even without any external force the rotation of an asteroid can be more complicated than a relaxed rotation around a xed axis
some asteroids are in force free precessing rotation state
such rotation can be described by euler equations that determine the evolution of euler angles
the rotation is fully described by eight parameters the angular momentum vector three components initial values of three euler angles and two principal moments of inertia normalized by the third one
the size of the angular momentum and the initial nutation angle can be replaced by two other parameters the rotation and precession periods that can be estimated from fourier analysis of lightcurves kaasalainen pravec et al

in practice reconstruction of the tumbling rotation state is more complicated than in case of principal axis rotation scanning of all physically possible combinations of parameters is time consuming so the best way how to proceed is to estimate candidate rotation and precession periods from the most prominent periods in the lightcurve signal scheirich et al
pravec et al

binaries binary and multiple systems are in general more interesting than single bodies see the view of margot et al
for example but reconstructing their geometrical and dynamical parameters is much more complicated
a general case can be very complex two similar size bodies orbiting each other on an eccentric orbit their rotation periods not synchronous with the orbital period the orbital plane may be precessing on longer time scales the spins may not be aligned with the normal to the orbital plane
the most detailed model we have so far was reconstructed by ostro et al
from radar observations of asteroid
the system was later directly imaged by vlt
we can not expect to reconstruct such details from lightcurves
however mutual events that we observe in lightcurves can be tted with a simple model assuming ellipsoidal shapes of the components and geometry of the orbit can be reconstructed scheirich and pravec carry et al

a special case is a fully synchronous system i
e
when two bodies orbit each other on a circular orbit and both rotation periods are the same as the orbital period
for a distant observer such system behaves like a single body because the mutual orientation of the components does not change
a slight modication of algorithms that can model nonconvex shapes enables us to model synchronous ries
however the nonconvex ambiguity applies also here so we can not expect to reconstruct correct shapes from lightcurves only
any disk resolved data would help of course so for example two stellar occultations by asteroid antiope revealed clear concavities durech et al
sect



master theorem taking into account all of the above we can for completeness write the full theorem of lightcurve inversion in all its glory
it includes the solution of the shape spin and physically realistic scattering behaviour not explicitly stated previously
eso
org public news theorem
extensive brightness data at nonzero solar phase angles uniquely determine the shape spin and scattering properties excluding albedo variegation of an asteroid when the shape is constrained as in kaasalainen et al
and viikinkoski et al
and scattering as in kaasalainen et al
for a unique solution
proof
the uniqueness and stability proof for convex shapes is summarised in e

kaasalainen and lamberg
in viikinkoski et al
and kaasalainen it was shown that with some assumptions a larger class of shapes than convex can be called reconstructable as suggested by numerical tests

durech and kaasalainen kaasalainen and durech
however it is certainly a smaller class than that of tangent covered bodies i
e
the shapes reconstructable from silhouettes of which convex bodies are a subset and the reconstruction is not stable
in practice if a convex solution and a convex one t the data as well there are innitely many nonconvex shapes between the two that also t the data
the spin solution is discussed above
for scattering a general form of a scattering model is given in eq

of kaasalainen and durech and its truncations such as eq

are very close to typical scattering models such as lommel seeliger lambert or hapke
the form
is exactly the same as eq

in kaasalainen et al
which leads to a unique solution of the scattering cients via eq


this is because the higher the order the resolution level of an unknown shape parameter is the more there are equations for it and this extra information can be used for a scattering solution
remark
the minkowski stability for the convex shape means that rather dierent scattering properties can account for the data with quite similar shapes thus the scattering solution is unstable so that one uses essentially xed scattering in inversion

instabilities near nonuniqueness summary we conclude our review of the uniqueness and stability properties of the photometric inverse problem in inverse problems of by discussing some cases where minkowski stability does not help us
tinuously parametrised systems ambiguities also translate to instabilities
if there is a nonuniqueness under some conditions then there are unstable solutions under nearby conditions
for example even the zero solar phase angle is actually sucient for a unique shape solution if the scattering is suitable kaasalainen et al

the often used combination of lommel seeliger and lambert scattering is suitable in principle the l s part equivalent to geometric scattering at zero solar phase yields the shape coecients of even degree and the lambert part diuse scattering those of odd degree
tering with a specularity exponent between one l s and two lambert would also yield all the cients
but the solution is inevitably unstable because of the data and model noise any uncertainty of the brightnesses or the lambert component close to zero for dark bodies results in large uncertainty in the coecients of odd degree
the lambert component is useful only at nonzero phase angles when its uncertainty is not a big issue
but again the phase angle needs to be suciently large more than say ten degrees for us to be clear from the instability region around the nonuniqueness condition
a further example of the same phenomenon is the case of nonconvexities close to strictly concave ones those without saddle like surface parts
concavities no matter how large or how deep are never uniquely constructable from photometry alone kaasalainen et al
viikinkoski et al
the latter also contains further ambiguity instability examples so the reconstruction of any nonconvexities close to the nonuniqueness condition is unavoidably unstable
in summary to obtain a fast global scale model of an asteroid from photometry one can solve for the spin and construct a convex shape with convexinv
for further educated guesses one can struct photometry based nonconvex models with using both octantoid and subdivision surface

below if there are several dense lightcurves to warrant this
a number of solutions obtained with various initial conditions are necessary
then one should compare the results from the three shape representations to identify common large scale features viikinkoski et al

such models are not rigorously dened and they are mostly governed by the representation type and the chosen regularisation functions but they may be useful for giving an impression of what the target might look like cf
the nonconvex models in kaasalainen et al

unless large solar phase angles are available durech and kaasalainen the convex solution is the only scientic one in the sense that it has well dened acceptance criteria and its approximate nature is well understood
it is the simplest solution with the fewest assumptions sucient for explaining the data down to the noise level
the acceptance of a more elaborate model can only be based on manifestly better data t requiring large phase angles or special assumptions limited to cases where the convex solution is not feasible even as an approximation e

choosing a bi lobed shape instead of a convex option cf
durech and kaasalainen
otherwise such a model is not likely to be closer to the correct shape than the convex solution by any quantitative criteria see also the discussion at the end of the appendix of kaasalainen
snapshot images occultations multidata the gp of adaptive optics ao images is essentially the photographic projection with instrumental point spread functions
occultations basically provide samples of the silhouette of the target
since ao processing typically causes some artefacts inside the image and in any case the strongest trast is along the contours of occlusion or shadows most of the information is in the boundary tours fetick et al

in the same way as the inversion of the brightness gp data can be proven to be unique for convex bodies and conditionally to some nonconvex ones viikinkoski et al
kaasalainen a class of nonconvex bodies can be proven to be reconstructable from image ary contours kaasalainen
this class is larger than that of tangent covered bodies
since most of the information is in the dark light boundary contours one can use these directly in shape reconstruction kaasalainen this also removes any modelling errors due to scattering from the image analysis
on the other hand one can also use the images as such data or model errors in the images inside the contours are not very signicant as weighed against the contour pixels
a robust way of doing this is to perform the t in the fourier transform domain rather than pixels viikinkoski and kaasalainen viikinkoski et al
this makes gradient based optimisation and the control of the size of image features especially convenient
often there are not enough images for complete reconstruction in such cases we can combine all the data from various instruments especially lightcurves with the images in the inversion process
this is in principle straightforward the main question is the weight assigned to each data type
finding the proper weights requires some experimenting and sampling
a criterion for the optimal weights can be established by requiring that each mode contribute its essential information but not more to yield solutions as consistent with each data source as possible
this is called the maximum compatibility estimate kaasalainen
a procedure for combining all available data sources to produce asteroid models all data asteroid modelling adam is described in viikinkoski et al

adam can be used for any data source separately including nonconvex models from lightcurves only but note the warnings above or combined with others
several asteroid models have been constructed especially with ao data and lightcurves using ther adam the fourier transform mode or extracted boundary contours carry et al
merline et al
viikinkoski et al
hanus et al
a
flyby images have also been combined with lightcurves in an analogous way to produce as constrained models as possible of the dark side combined with the exact cartography of the seen side keller et al
sierks et al

occultation data can be included in the inversion process as such or used as a consistency check durech et al

with ever improving ao equipment the best images in the process are approaching cartographic resolution viikinkoski et al
carry et al
vernazza et al
marsset et al
almost carrying the problem away from the realm of inverse problems into cartography photoclinometry gaskell et al

that have well established methods
but with all ao images it is important to remember that a feature seen in an image can only be considered real and veried if it is seen in at least another image in a consistent manner
otherwise it is only plausible or if inconsistent with other data nonexistent
such spurious detail can be caused by the deconvolution or post processing of raw ao images
the deconvolution of images is a separate inverse problem often practical for shape modelling and feature identication
while not perfect it can be seen as further model independent regularisation that introduces useful prior constraints in addition to the point spread function into the full inverse problem
another essential concept closely linked with shape class is the shape representation
there simply is no universal way of representing shape models in inverse problems the choice always restricts the convergence and possible shape solutions in some way
convex bodies are simple to describe by the positive curvature translatable to shape via the minkowski procedure whereas nonconvex shapes have various subclasses and thus representations
these can be e

starlike or radius displacements from given basic shapes or something specially made for a problem case kaasalainen et al
ostro et al
or generalised starlike octantoid or subdivision control points kaasalainen and viikinkoski viikinkoski and kaasalainen bartczak and dudzinski or level sets
ideally at least two shape representations should be used in any given problem to establish the role of systematic shape eects viikinkoski et al

an important issue in this context is also inverse crime kaipio and somersalo
simulating data is necessary in testing an inversion method and the general uniqueness and stability of the problem or the information content available from a particular observational setup e

nortunen et al

in such cases one easily makes the mistake of creating the data with the same model they are inverted with which is called inverse crime
this can result in much too overcondent solutions and ated resolution
avoiding inverse crime is not just about not using the same discretisation level in data creation and analysis it applies to data noise that should include non gaussian elements surface tering that in addition to dierent forward and inverse problem models should include some random behaviour over the surface in data creation the surface representations and so on
even with these cautions computer simulations in asteroid modelling are always likely to produce better results than in real life simply because nature is much more imaginative in producing variation in physical conditions and error sources than we are
in spite of the speed and parallelisability of computers and clusters some numerical and tational aspects require consideration
in optimisation procedures that only use the function value are slow and converge poorly
genetic algorithms are a particularly poor variation of these for this problem and they are not well suited for general analysis as they typically lose the information on other eligible minima
in this problem class local minima are usually sparse enough so that gradient based sation procedures in particular levenberg marquardt designed for chi square type problems such as these started from a variety of initial guesses are superior in both speed and accuracy
moreover by exploring the whole parameter space we can be sure that the global minimum is not missed
also the best eciency by far is obtained from analytical gradients readily available in this case
in gration over model surface ray tracing is fast to carry out with some pre listing of occluding surface patches triangles kaasalainen et al

many parts of the problem parallelise easily to e

gpus viikinkoski et al

one can also use game based image processing hardware but this may not be useful for obtaining the function gradients
to this the data noise restricted observation geometries partly subjective choices in regularisation and systematic errors in both data and the model scattering
and it becomes obvious that the whole thing is not solvable just by plugging some components together and letting the machine run
obviously no single rendering of the solution is sucient in asteroid modelling from any sources the dierences between the rendering samples help to understand which parts of the solution are best constrained by the data
on the other hand the usual sampling methods mcmc are slow and can not be employed because systematic and model errors dominate over noise and are not modellable in the usual mcmc fashion and because the chosen shape representation biases the results
the only free shape space to sample would be a large set of mesh vertices each free to move around but this is extremely dicult to arrange in practice and even then one would need regularisation to keep the mesh from getting tangled
after various experiments we have found the simplest way to sample is to compare the best solutions from dierent setups

implications for observers adaptive optics although ao images taken with the vlt sphere instrument look almost like tographs taken by spacecraft hygiea in vernazza et al
for example they are always product of deconvolution which can be source of inconsistencies and artefacts
for example the deconvolved ages of vesta in fetick et al
reveal amazing details on the surface at the diraction limit the limb was reconstructed with resolution better that the formal diraction limit but still there are artefacts on the disk near the limb
in general the result of deconvolution depend on the method parameter setup and there is always a trade o between the level of details and presence of false artefacts
occultations with a dramatic increase of accuracy of stellar catalogues due to gaia astrometry cultations by asteroids can be now predicted with higher accuracy
the technical equipment is also improving so occultations will play an important role in shape modelling
they are also the only way how to obtain information about shapes of trans neptunian objects that are too far to be reconstructable by lightcurve inversion opposition geometry and also unresolvable by ao
stranger projections radar interferometry interferometry especially that from alma at thermal ir wavelengths is another high resolution data source of asteroids
it is essentially the fourier transform of a thermal image so adam is readily usable for inversion viikinkoski et al

for the available resolution level analogously to resolution ao images boundary contours provide most of the shape information the thermal modelling can be done fast by a semianalytical fourier series model nesvorny and vokrouhlicky
radar is the main source of high resolution information from near earth asteroids benner et al

its gp is somewhat strange in the sense that it projects surface points with a given radial velocity and distance from the radar onto one projection image point
thus the image is a many to one mapping contrary to usual images which aects its information content
while computational inversion of doppler radar data has been in use since the early as described in ostro et al
the ness of the shape solution of the inverse problem was actually proved in viikinkoski and kaasalainen
the proof was based on using the boundary contours of range doppler images that are even more pronounced in their information content than those of ao images and it was shown that the shape class reconstructable from these is that of tangent covered bodies
other parts of the radar image vide further information and enlarge the reconstructable class
in kaasalainen and lamberg it was shown that mere range radar data from a spherical target uniquely determine not only the tivity corresponding to albedo map on its surface but also the distribution of other radar scattering properties
doppler radar data uniquely determine the reectivity
radar is thus a provably rich source of information and it has the potential for very high resolution
however it should be remembered that due to the inherent ambiguities of the range doppler plots as well as the modelling and data errors the actual resolution level of a radar based model is seldom as high as the nominal apparent resolution of the images
this is well apparent from the ground truth probe images of itokawa and toutatis although the available radar observation geometries were somewhat limited or by the dierence of the features of the kleopatra radar model model with those of the ao one even though the models are qualitatively similar
on the other hand the case of asteroid bennu essentially a convex shape covered by many small boulders and a large one shows that some detailed features including the large boulder on the southern hemisphere can be captured by a tailored radar model nolan et al

there are various software packages for radar modelling radar data can be automatically included in adam input and adam is orders of magnitude faster than traditional radar codes
in any case the addition of special features to the adam or any other basic model usually requires a hand crafted model within a model
radar data are peculiar in that it is possible to have a sequence of high resolution radar images without being able to model and place the corresponding detail anywhere in a model with reasonable certainty
with the ordinary photographic image projection details from even one resolution image can in principle always be added at least manually and tentatively to a low resolution shape model mostly based on other data such as lightcurves
thus assessing the reliability of shape models from radar data especially at limited geometries is considerably more complicated than in the case of ordinary plane of sky projections
