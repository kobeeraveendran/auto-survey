dcs abstract
usage of online textual media is steadily increasing
daily more and more news stories blog posts and scientic articles are added to the online umes
these are all freely accessible and have been employed extensively in tiple research areas e

automatic text summarization information retrieval formation extraction
meanwhile online debate forums have recently become popular but have remained largely unexplored
for this reason there are no cient resources of annotated debate data available for conducting research in this genre
in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic summarization task
similar to extractive gold standard summary generation our data contains sentences worthy to include into a summary
five human annotators performed this task
inter annotator agreement based on semantic similarity is for cohen s kappa and for krippendorff s alpha
moreover we also implement an extractive summarization system for online debates and discuss prominent features for the task of summarizing online debate data automatically
keywords online debate summarization text summarization semantic larity information extraction sentence extraction introduction with the exponential growth of internet usage online users massively publish textual content on online media
for instance a micro blogging website twitter allows users to post their content in characters length
a popular social media like facebook allows users to interact and share content in their communities as known as friends
an electronic commercial website amazon allows users to ask questions on their terested items and give reviews on their purchased products
while these textual data have been broadly studied in various research areas e

automatic text tion information retrieval information extraction
online debate domain which recently becomes popular among internet users has not yet largely explored
for this reason there are no sufcient resources of annotated debate data available for ing research in this genre
this motivates us to explore online debate data
in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic tion task
there are debate topics collected
each topic consists of different number g u a l c
s c v
v i x r a gold standard online debates summaries of debate comments
in total there are debate comments collected accounting for sentences
in order to annotate online debate data we developed a web based system which simply runs on web browsers
we designed the user interface for technical users
when participants logged into the system a debate topic and a comment which is split to a list of consecutive sentences were shown at a time
the annotators were asked to select salient sentences from each comment which summarize it
the number of salient sentences chosen from each comment is controlled by a compression rate of which is automatically calculated by the web based system
for instance table shows a debate comment to be annotated by an annotator
based on the pression rate of the annotator needs to choose sentence that summarizes the comment
this compression rate was also used in and
in total we obtained sets of annotated debate data
each set of data consists of comments with total annotated salient sentences
inter annotator agreement in terms of cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha are
and
respectively
for social media data such low agreements have been also reported by related work
for instance reports kappa scores between
and
for human constructed newswire summaries
reports again kappa scores between
and
for the conversation transcripts
our agreement scores are based on strict conditions where agreement is achieved when annotators have selected exact the same sentences
however such condition does not consider syntactically different sentences bearing the same semantic meaning
thus we also experimented with a more relaxed version that is based on semantic similarity between sentences
we regard two sentences as identical when their semantic similarity is above a threshold
our results revealed that after applying such an approach the averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha increase to
and
respectively
finally we report our results of automatic debate data summarization
we mented an extractive text summarization system that extracts salience sentences from user comments
among the features the most contributing ones are sentence position debate titles and cosine similarity of the debate title words and sentences
the paper is structured as follows
first we describe the nature of our online bate data
in section we discuss the procedures of data annotation and discuss our experiments with semantic similarity applied on inter annotator agreement tion
in section we present our rst results on automatically performing debate data summarization
we conclude in section

task is global warming ctitious i do not think global warming is ctitious
i understand a lot of people do not trust every source and they need solid proof
however if you look around us the proof is everywhere
it began when the seasons started getting harsh and the water levels were rising
i do not need to go and see the ice caps melting to know the water levels are rising and the weather is changing
i believe global warming is true and we should try and preserve as much of the earth as possible

example propositions from the proponents global warming is real
global warming is an undisputed scientic fact
global warming is most denitely not a gment of anyone s imagination because the proof is all around us
i believe that global warming is not ctitious based on the observational and comparative evidence that is currently presented to us
example propositions from the opponents global warming is bull crap
global warming is nt a problem at all
just a way for the government to tax people on more things by saying their trying to save energy
yes global warming is a myth because they have not really proven the science behind it
online debate data and their nature the nature of online debate is different from other domains
it gives opportunities to users to discuss ideological debates in which users can choose a stance of a debate express their opinions to support their stance and oppose other stances
to conduct our experiments we collected debate data from the debate discussion forum
the data are related to an issue of the existence of global warming
in the data there are two main opposing sides of the arguments
a side of proponents believes in the existence of global warming and the other side the opponents says that global warming is not true
when the proponents and the opponents express their sentiments opinions and evidences to support their propositions the arguments between them arise
moreover when the arguments are referred across the conversation in the forum they are

annotation procedures in this paper we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic summarization task
there are debate topics collected
each topic consists of a different number of debate comments as shown in table
the annotation was guided through a web based application
the application was designed for non technical users
when participants logged in to the system a debate topic and a comment which is split to a list of tences were shown at a time
the annotators were given a guideline to read and select salient sentences that summarize the comments
from each comment we allowed the participants to select only of the comment sentences
these of the sentences are treated as the summary of the shown comment
in the annotation task all comments in the debate topics were annotated
we recruited participants males and participants to annotate salient sentences
the participants backgrounds were those who are uent in english and aged above years old
we aimed to have annotations sets for each debate topic
due to a limited number of annotators and a long list of comments to be annotated in each debate topic participants were asked to complete more than one debate topic but were not allowed to annotate the same debate topics in which they had done before
in total annotation sets were derived debate topics and each with annotation sets
each annotation set consists of comments with total annotated salient sentences

inter annotator agreement in order to compute inter annotator agreement between the annotators we calculated the averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha with a distant metric measuring agreement on set valued items metric masi
the scores of averaged cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha are
and
respectively
according to the scale of our alpha did neither accomplish the reliability scale of
nor the marginal scales between
and

likewise our cohen s kappa only achieved the agreement level of fair agreement as dened by
however such low agreement scores are also reported by others who aimed creating gold standard summaries from news texts or conversational data
our analysis shows that the low agreement is caused by different preferences of annotators in the selection of salient sentences
as shown in table the sentences are syntactically different but bear the same semantic meaning
in a summarization task with a compression threshold such situation causes the annotators to select one of the sentences but not all
depending on each annotator s preference the selection leads to different set of salient sentences
to address this we relaxed the agreement computation by treating sentences equal when they are semantically similar
we outline details in the following section

relaxed inter annotator agreement when an annotator selects a sentence other annotators might select other sentences expressing similar meaning
in this experiment we aim to detect sentences that are semantically similar by applying from the gensim package
model simultaneously learns the representation of words in sentences and the labels of the sentences
the labels are numbers or chunks of text which are used to uniquely identify each sentence
we used the debate data and a richer collections of sentences lated to climate change to train the model
in total there are sentences used as the training set
to measure how two sentences are semantically referring to the same content we used a function provided in the package to calculate cosine similarity scores among sentences
a cosine similarity score of means that the two sentences are semantically equal and is when it is opposite the case
in the experiment we manually investigated pairs of sentences at different threshold values and found that the approach is stable at the threshold level above

the example below shows a pair of sentences obtained at
level
humans are emitting carbon from our cars planes and factories which is a heat trapping particle
so there is no doubt that carbon is a heat trapping particle there is no doubt that our actions are emitting carbon into the air and there is no doubt that the amount of carbon is increasing
in the pair the two sentences mention the same topic i
e
carbon emission and express the idea in the same context
we used the threshold
to re compute the gold standard online debates summaries agreement scores
by applying the semantic approach the inter annotator agreement scores of cohen s kappa and krippendorff s alpha increase from
to
and from
to
respectively
the inter annotator agreement results are illustrated in table
note that in the calculation of the agreement we incremented the threshold by

only particular thresholds are shown in the table due to the limited space

automatic salient sentence selection
support vector regression model in this experiment we work on extractive summarization problem and aim to select sentences that are deemed important or that summarize the information mentioned in debate comments
additionally we aim to investigate the keys features which play the important roles in the summarization of the debate data
we view this salient sentence selection as a regression task
a regression score for each sentence is ranged between to
it is derived by the number annotators selected that sentence divided by the ber of all annotators
in this experiment a popular machine learning package which is available in python called scikit learn is used to build a support vector regression model
we dened different features and the support vector regression model bines the features for scoring sentences in each debate comment
from each comment sentences with the highest regression scores are considered the most salient ones

feature denition gold standard online debates summaries
sentence position sp
sentence position correlates with the important tion in text
in general humans are likely to mention the rst topic in the earlier sentence and they express more information about it in the later sentences
we prove this claim by conducting a small experiment to investigate which tence positions frequently contain salient sentences
from our annotated data the majority votes of the sentences are signicantly at the rst three positions imately shaping the assumption that the rst three sentences are considered as containing salient pieces of information
equation shows the calculation of the score obtained by the sentence position feature
sentence position if position otherwise sp
debate titles tt
in writing a writer tends to repeat the title words in a ment
for this reason a sentence containing title words is likely to contain tant information
we collected debate titles as shown in table
in our iment a sentence is considered as important when it contains mutual words as in debate titles
equation shows the calculation of the score by this feature
t t number of title words in sentence number of words in debate titles
sentence length sl
sentence length also indicates the importance of sentence based on the assumption that either very short or very long sentences are unlikely to be included in the summary
equation is used in the process of extracting salient sentences from debate comments
sl number of words in a sentence number of words in the longest sentence
conjunctive adverbs cj
one possible feature that helps identify salient tence is to determine conjunctive adverbs in sentences
conjunctive adverbs were proved that they support cohesive structure of writing
for instance the tive adverb moreover has been used mostly in the essays which lead to a conclusion that it is one of the best accepted linkers in the academic writing process

the nltk pos was used to determine conjunctive adverbs in our data

cosine similarity
cosine similarity has been used extensively in information trieval especially in the vector space model
documents will be ranked according to the similarity of the given query
equation illustrates the equation of cosine similarity where q and d are n dimensional vectors
cosine similarity is one of our features that is used to nd similarity between two textual units
the ing features are computed by applying cosine similarity

nltk
org api nltk
tag
html gold standard online debates summaries n qidi n p i n i s p s p cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences cos tts
for each sentence in debate comments we compute its cosine similarity score with the title words
this is based on the assumption that a sentence containing title words is deemed as important
cosine similarity of climate change terms and sentences cos ccts
the climate change terms were collected from news media about climate change
we calculate cosine similarity between the terms and sentences
in total there are most frequent terms relating to location person organization and chemical compounds
cosine similarity of topic signatures and sentences cos tps
topic natures play an important role in automatic text summarization and information retrieval
it helps identify the presence of complex concepts or the importance in text
in a process of determining topic signatures words appearing ally in the input text but rarely in other text are considered as topic signatures
they are determined by an automatic predened threshold which indicates scriptive information
topic signatures are generated by comparing with classied text on the same topic using a concept of likelihood ratio presented by
it is a statistical approach which calculates a likelihood of a word
for each word in the input the likelihood of word occurrence is culated in pre classied text collection
another likelihood values of the same word is calculated and compared in another out of topic collection
the word on the topic text collection that has higher likelihood value than the out topic collection is regarded as topic signature of a topic
otherwise the word is ignored

semantic similarity of sentence and debate titles cos stt
since the mentioned features do not semantically capture the meaning of context we create this feature for such purpose
we compare each sentence to the list of debate tles based on the assumption that forum users are likely to repeat debate titles in their comments
thus we compare each sentence to the titles and then calculate the semantic similarity score by using

results in order to evaluate the system summaries against the reference summaries we apply rouge n evaluation metrics
we report unigram bi grams and rouge skip bigram with maximum gap length of

our results indicate that there is statistically signicance among the features

conclusion in this paper we worked on an annotation task for a new annotated dataset online debate data
we have manually collected reference summaries for comments given to global warming topics
the data consists of comments with total annotated salient sentences
we have performed ve annotation sets on this data so that in total we have x annotated salient sentences
we also implemented an extractive text tion system on this debate data
our results revealed that the key feature that plays the most important role in the selection salient sentences is sentence position
other useful features are debate title words feature and cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences feature
gold standard online debates summaries in future work we aim to investigate further features for the summarization poses
we also plan to integrate stance information so that summaries with pro contra sides can be generated
