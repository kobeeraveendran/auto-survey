pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization jingqing zhang yao zhao mohammad saleh peter j
liu abstract recent work pre training transformers with self supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when ne tuned on downstream nlp tasks including text rization
however pre training objectives lored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored
furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse in this work we propose pre training mains
large transformer based encoder decoder els on massive text corpora with a new supervised objective
in pegasus important sentences are removed masked from an input ument and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences similar to an extractive summary
we evaluated our best pegasus model on downstream tion tasks spanning news science stories tions emails patents and legislative bills
ments demonstrate it achieves state of the art formance on all downstream datasets measured by rouge scores
our model also shows ing performance on low resource summarization surpassing previous state of the art results on datasets with only examples
finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets

figure the base architecture of pegasus is a standard transformer encoder decoder
both gsg and mlm are applied simultaneously to this example as pre training jectives
originally there are three sentences
one sentence is masked with and used as target generation text gsg
the other two sentences remain in the input but some tokens are randomly masked by mlm
introduction text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise summaries from input
in contrast to extractive summarization which merely copies informative fragments from the input abstractive summarization may generate novel words
a good abstractive summary covers principal information in the input and is linguistically uent
summarization in abstractive sequence to sequence sutskever et al
has become a dominant framework using encoder decoder architectures based on rnns chung et al
hochreiter schmidhuber and more recently transformers vaswani et al

most prior work on neural abstractive summarization relied on large scale high quality datasets of supervised document summary pairs hermann et al
and achieved promising results rush et al
nallapati et al

in recent years there has been increased interest in collecting new summarization datasets that have more abstractive summaries narayan et al

we nd that masking whole sentences from a ment and generating these gap sentences from the rest of the document works well as a pre training objective for stream summarization tasks
in particular choosing tively important sentences outperforms lead or randomly selected ones
we hypothesize this objective is suitable for abstractive summarization as it closely resembles the stream task encouraging whole document understanding and summary like generation
we call this self supervised objective gap sentences generation gsg
using gsg to pre train a transformer encoder decoder on large pora of documents web and news articles results in our method pre training with extracted gap sentences for stractive summarization sequence to sequence models or pegasus
with our best m parameter model trained on the cently introduced raffel et al
we equal or exceed state of the art on the summarization tasks we consider
we further push forward the state of the art using a newly collected text corpus comprised of news like articles we call hugenews including the highly competitive xsum and cnn dailymail summarization datasets
large scale document summary datasets are rare and in practice there is a mismatch between research datasets and real world use cases where collecting summaries is sive the most common setting is that of low resource marization
we simulate this setting and show that our model is able to adapt very quickly when ne tuning with small numbers of supervised pairs obtaining state of the art results in datasets with only examples
qualitatively we observed high quality outputs from our best models and validated this in human evaluation studies
we found that pegasus summaries are at least as good as reference summaries for the datasets we assessed xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu even at low levels of supervision
to summarize our contributions we propose a new self supervised pre training tive for abstractive summarization gap sentences eration and study strategies for selecting those tences
we evaluate the proposed pre training objective on a broad range of downstream summarization tasks with careful ablations to choose the best model settings which we use to train a m parameter pegasus model that surpasses or is on par with the state of art on all downstream datasets considered
we show how good abstractive summarization mance can be achieved across broad domains with very little supervision by ne tuning the pegasus model and surpassing previous state of the art results on many tasks with as little as examples
we conducted human evaluation studies to validate our experimental design and demonstrate human level marization performance on xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu
related work dai le ramachandran et al
used lm and autoencoder pre training on in domain data to improve formance of rnn sequence models
however the tion of pre training with much larger external text corpora such as wikipedia books or web pages and based sequence models has led to a dramatic improvement in performance when ne tuned for both natural language derstanding and text generation tasks radford et al
devlin et al
rothe et al
yang et al

most similar to our approach are transformer encoder decoder models pre trained on some masked input pre training objective
mass song et al
proposed masked sequence sequence generation that reconstructs a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence
a single sentence fragment was randomly selected
unilm dong et al
proposed jointly training on three types of language modeling tasks unidirectional to right and right to left bidirectional word level mask pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization with next sentence prediction and sequence to sequence word level mask prediction
however such a procedure would only train a model to copy sentences thus not suitable for abstractive summarization
raffel et al
generalized the text to text work to a variety of nlp tasks and showed the advantage of scaling up model size to billion parameters and pre training corpus introducing a massive text corpus derived from common crawl which we also use in some of our models
was pre trained with randomly corrupted text spans of varying mask ratios and sizes of spans
bart lewis et al
introduced a denoising coder to pre train sequence to sequence models
bart corrupted text with an arbitrary noising function and learned to reconstruct the original text
for generation tasks the noising function was text inlling which used single mask tokens to mask random sampled spans of text
in contrast to mass unilm bart and the proposed pegasus masks multiple whole sentences rather than smaller continuous text spans
in our nal objective we deterministically choose sentences based on importance rather than randomly
as in pegasus does not struct full input sequences and only generates the masked sentences as a single output sequence
in this work we focus entirely on downstream summarization generative tasks and do not evaluate on nlu classication tasks
there has been some work on the low resource rization setting using the cnn dailymail dataset
radford et al
showed that a large transformer language model pre trained on web text could generate summaries if prompted with achieving a of

khandelwal et al
pre trained a transformer language model on wikipedia and ne tuned using examples achieving

inspired by recent success in masking words and contiguous spans joshi et al
raffel et al
we select and mask whole sentences from documents and concatenate the gap sentences into a pseudo summary
the corresponding position of each selected gap sentence is replaced by a mask token to inform the model
gap sentences ratio or gsr refers to the number of selected gap sentences to the total number of sentences in the document which is similar to mask rate in other works
to even more closely approximate a summary we select sentences that appear to be important principal to the ument
the resulting objective has both the empirically demonstrated benets of masking and anticipates the form of the downstream task
we consider primary strategies for selecting m gap tences without replacement from a document d comprised of n sentences random uniformly select m sentences at random
lead select the rst m sentences
principal select top m scored sentences according to portance
as a proxy for importance we compute lin between the sentence and the rest of the document d xi i
in this formulation sentences are scored independently ind and the top m selected
we also consider selecting them sequentially seq as in nallapati et al
by greedily maximizing the between selected sentences s xi and remaining sentences d s xi as in algorithm
pre training objectives algorithm sequential sentence selection we propose a new pre training objective gsg in this work but for comparison we also evaluate bert s language model objective in isolation and in conjunction with gsg

gap sentences generation gsg we hypothesize that using a pre training objective that more closely resembles the downstream task leads to better and faster ne tuning performance
given our intended use for abstractive summarization our proposed pre training tive involves generating summary like text from an input document
in order to leverage massive text corpora for training we design a sequence to sequence self supervised objective in the absence of abstactive summaries
a naive option would be to pre train as an extractive summarizer s xi d s xi s for j to m do rouge i s
t
s k arg s s xk end for when calculating we also consider n grams as a set uniq instead of double counting identical n grams as in the original implementation orig
this results in four variants of the principal sentence selection strategy choosing ind seq and orig uniq options
an example containing lead random and principal gap tence selection strategies are shown in figure

masked language model mlm following bert we select tokens in the input text and the selected tokens are of time replaced by a mask token or of time replaced by a random token or of time unchanged
we apply mlm to train the transformer encoder as the sole pre training tive or along with gsg
when mlm is the sole pre training objective the transformer decoder shares all parameters with encoder when ne tuning on downstream tasks ing rothe et al

figure simultaneously shows how both gsg and mlm are applied to the same example when used in conjunction
however we found that mlm does not improve stream tasks at large number of pre training steps section

and chose not to include mlm in the nal model pegasuslarge section

following grusky et al
the number of examples and tive fragment coverage density for all downstream datasets is illustrated in appendix a
experiments in a similar strategy to raffel et al
to save time and computation we conducted pre training ablation periments using a reduced size model with m eters pegasusbase smaller batch size and only of datasets before scaling up pre training with the best tings to the nal m parameters pegasuslarge
the datasets xsum cnn dailymail wikihow and reddit tifu were chosen for diversity in abstractiveness writing style and size
pegasusbase had l h f a and pegasuslarge had l h f a where l denotes the number of ers for encoder and decoder i
e
transformer blocks h for the hidden size f for the feed forward layer size and a for the number of self attention heads
we pre trained pegasusbase with a batch size of and pegasuslarge with a batch size of
we refer to pegasusbase without pre training as transformerbase
we used sinusoidal positional encoding following vaswani et al

for optimization both pre training and tuning used adafactor shazeer stern with square root learning rate decay and dropout rate of

we used greedy decoding for studies in section
and used beam search with a length penalty as in wu et al
for the nal large model
all experiments hyper parameters can be found in pendix c and reported numbers are in appendix d and e

ablations on pegasusbase we used pegasusbase to evaluate choices of pre training corpus pre training objective and vocabulary size
for producibility we evaluated the latter two using the publicly available corpus
note that the y axis in figures are normalized by the left most bar using where rl are rouge scores and rlbase are the scores of the conguration corresponding to the rst bar
rl rlbase with more pre training steps the model observed more uments in the pre training corpus
a pegasusbase model trained for highest we tried steps did not observe all training examples on nor hugenews
appendix b shows the number of pre training steps had an unsurprisingly tive impact on downstream dataset performance
we used steps for the ablation studies and the large model


pre training corpus figure effect of pre training corpus
pegasusbase pre trained on m web pages and hugenews
news like documents
figure shows that pre training on hugenews was more effective than on the two news downstream datasets while the non news informal datasets wikihow and reddit tifu prefer the pre training on
this suggests training models transfer more effectively to downstream tasks when their domains are aligned better


effect of pre training objectives gsg we compared six variants of gsg lead random ind orig ind uniq seq orig seq uniq while choosing sentences as gap sentences
as shown in figure orig achieved the best performance followed by seq uniq
ind orig and seq uniq were consistently better or similar than random and lead across the four downstream datasets
lead had decent performance on the two news datasets but was signicantly worse on the two non news datasets which agrees ndings of lead bias in news datasets see et al
zhong et al

the results suggest choosing principal sentences works best for downstream summarization tasks and we chose ind orig for the pegasuslarge
a signicant hyper parameter in gsg is the gap sentences ratio gsr
a low gsr makes the pre training less lenging and computationally efcient
on the other hand choosing gap sentences at a high gsr loses contextual xsumcnn dailymailwikihowreddit

we compared gsrs from to
for a fair comparison the original documents were truncated to have up to words
the maximum input length linput in the encoder and the mum target length ltarget in the decoder were set as tokens
figure shows that different downstream datasets had slightly different optima
the best performance always had gsr lower than
the model with gap sentences achieved the highest rouge scores on cnn dailymail while xsum reddit tifu and wikihow did better with and respectively
when scaling up to pegasuslarge section
we chose an effective gsr of
mlm as mentioned the mlm objective can either be plied solely or together with gsg
we jointly trained mlm with gsg ind orig mlm ind orig which masks sentences and extra tokens in unselected sentences as shown in figure
figure shows that the model trained with mlm alone performed signicantly worse and mlm ind orig had similar performance as random
terestingly when comparing mlm ind orig to ind orig we empirically observed mlm improved ne tuning formance at early pre training checkpoints steps but inhibited further gains with more pre training steps
therefore we chose not to include mlm in pegasuslarge


effect of vocabulary we compared two tokenization byte encoding algorithm bpe wu et al
sennrich et al
and sentencepiece unigram algorithm unigram proposed in kudo
we evaluated unigram with ferent vocabulary sizes ranging from to

this would present a problem for position beddings which would never be updated for longer input lengths but we conrm the postulation that sinusoidal sitional encodings vaswani et al
generalize well when ne tuning pegasuslarge beyond the input lengths observed in training up to linput tokens
since average input length in bigpatent arxiv pubmed and multi news are well beyond tokens further scaling up linput or applying a two stage approach liu et al
may improve performance even more although this is side the scope of this work
tables and show the performance improvements of pegasusbase and pegasuslarge on downstream datasets
while pegasusbase exceeded current state the art on many datasets pegasuslarge achieved better than state of the art results on all downstream datasets using hugenews although performed better on wikihow
the improvement from a transformer model without training transformerbase to pegasuslarge was more signicant on smaller datasets
for example the scores nearly tripled on aeslc and quintupled on dit tifu
the large jumps in performance suggest that small text summarization datasets benet the most from pre training
we further investigate low resource rization in section


zero and low resource summarization in real world practice it is often difcult to collect a large number of supervised examples to train or ne tune a marization model
to simulate the low resource tion setting we picked the rst k training examples from each dataset to ne tune pegasuslarge hugenews
we ne tuned the models up to steps with batch size learning rate
and picked the checkpoint with best validation performance

pegasuslarge could be ne tuned to generate summaries at comparable quality to transformerbase trained on the full supervised datasets ranging from to examples

on cnn dailymail with half the number of ters pegasuslarge demonstrated much better zero shot

using only examples pegasuslarge achieved f of
much higher than the
obtained in khandelwal et al
with examples

qualitative observations and human evaluation overall we observed high linguistic quality in terms of ency and coherence closely emulating the style of truth summaries
while some previous work suggested that maximum likelihood training results in repetitive text in model outputs welleck et al
we found this to be rare in our outputs and did not require additional measures to mitigate
although rouge clearly has its draw backs kryscinski et al
over penalizing abstractive approaches pared to extractive ones and having no sense of tic quality we found that choosing perplexity optimized models using aggregated rouge rather than directly timizing rouge as in paulus et al
resulted in qualitatively good models
randomly sampled by a gram model decodes across all datasets and a broad range of rouge scores can be found in appendix i
we found that even low rouge model summaries often were quality figure g

to assess how close pegasuslarge is to human mance we conducted human evaluation experiments on amazon mechanical turk comparing model summaries with human reference summaries given the input document
the examples were drawn from the xsum cnn dailymail and reddit tifu datasets the rst two were chosen due to their popularity in past work and the third was chosen for its signicant difference in style
workers were asked to rate the summaries on a scale with higher being better full experiment details provided in appendix f and a paired t test was used to assess whether scores were signicantly different from human
in the rst experiment pegasuslarge hugenews pegasuslarge and transformerbase were pared with reference summaries in the second experiment pegasuslarge hugenews ne tuned using and all supervised examples were compared with references the results are shown in table
according to the signicance level of p
both pegasuslarge hugenews and pegasuslarge outputs were at least as good as the reference summaries in all cases
even at low levels of supervision pegasuslarge hugenews was not measurably worse than human summaries on xsum and cnn dailymail
in the reddit tifu case however haps due to its diverse writing styles human performance required full supervision

test set overlap with pre training corpus the pre training corpora are a large collection of documents from the internet and potentially have overlap with the stream test sets
in this section we measured the extent of overlap between the pre training corpus and downstream datasets
we also studied if the pre trained model was able to exploit memorization to achieve higher performance on the downstream datasets
to measure the overlap we calculated similarities between all pairs of downstream test set targets and pre training documents
we use the recall as a similarity measure common grams test set targets grams
it is not necessarily exact match even if the similarity score is

we ltered all test set examples that have similarity to any pre training example above a threshold and recalculated the rouge scores on the remaining test set
in figure we conducted this study on the pre training and test set of xsum cnn dailymail reddit tifu and wikihow with a similarity threshold of
and

results show that only xsum has signicant amount of overlap to and ltering those examples does not change rouge scores more than
we also manually examined those overlapped examples with similarity of
and found that the models produce very different summaries compared to the human written ones suggesting that there was no clear memorization
figure percentage of overlap between and stream test sets and rouge score changes after removing those overlapped examples in test sets

additional pegasuslarge improvements following our experiments on pegasuslarge pre trained on and hugenews we pre trained a pegasuslarge model on both corpora and stochastically sampled important sentences

pegasus pre training with extracted gap sentences for abstractive summarization f human evaluation details in all human evaluation experiments we used the same task template shown in figure f
where workers were asked to rate summaries for a document on a scale of poor summary to great summary
the order in which the summaries are presented for each task was random per example
each task was independently done by different workers and we retained the median score across workers for each summary
we paid usd per task and used the following critieria for workers to ensure high quality location us minimum approval rate minimum hiits with this criteria we observed high reproducibility in the conclusions of the huamn evaluation
multiple runs of the same experiment with different workers meeting this criteria yielded very similar results
the hitt template is provided at
com google research pegasus
in experiment the four summaries corresponded to models pegasuslarge pre trained on hugenews and transformerbase that were ne tuned using all the supervised examples along with the reference human summary
we sampled examples from each dataset xsum cnn dailymail reddit tifu
in experiment we evaluated models pegasuslarge pre trained on hugenews ne tuned using different amounts of supervision and all examples alongside the human summary
to do this with the same template for each example we randomly selected out of the summaries
this resulted in fewer ratings per model but did not increase the work and cost of the task
we used a paired t test to determine statistical signicance when comparing the ratings of two sets of summaries

another ccg told pulse it had considered the full impact of the incentive scheme and was condent that there is no conict of interest

but rotherham were soon back on level terms as kieffer moore who like marriott hit a hat trick in his previous league appearance headed in captain lee frecklington s left wing cross
marriott then steered a marcus maddison cross against a post to be denied by the woodwork for the second time after seeing an early effort hit the underside of the crossbar
rotherham thought they had hit the front moments later only to see their celebrations cut short by a raised ag when jamie proctor nodded in from close range

the early work carried out on mice and pigs reveals the protein infused patch encourages the growth of healthy cells and leads to less scarring
scarring can be common after a heart attack making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail
writing in the journal nature researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment
during an attack muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood ow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long term damage
in this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks
though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack
two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels while showing signs of pumping more effectively
prof pilar ruiz lozano at stanford university which has patented the patch said many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation
the hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage

despite the absence of president obama around world leaders are expected here at un headquarters including french president francois hollande and prime minister trudeau from canada
but their signatures alone will not be enough to make the paris agreement operational
the legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratication
for some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the united states
others though such as india and japan will have to take the document to their parliaments some may need new laws
the european union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out
each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually
some countries including the marshall islands palau fiji and switzerland have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on april

there could be serious implications for gloucestershire police the police and crime commissioner has warned
cotswold district council s proposal to form a unity authority with west oxfordshire has proved controversial
but cdc says the plans dubbed coxit are at an early stage but aim to improve accountability
cdc leader lynden stowe has said gloucestershire s historic borders would remain under the proposals which aim to improve the administration and the delivery of council services
he told bbc radio gloucestershire a few weeks ago we would expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders exactly as now so if there s a crime in cirencester gloucestershire police attend and if there s a burglary in burford thames valley police attend
but gloucestershire s pcc martin surl said he had taken legal advice on the coxit proposal and warned it could signal the end of gloucestershire police as we know it
under the local government and public involvement in health act he said the cotswolds could become part of thames valley police district
if they break away to a new district we ca nt continue policing just half a district he told the bbc
so either we start taking some of thames valley s area in oxfordshire or they start policing parts of gloucestershire
neither want that
a spokesman for cotswold district council said they fully understand the initial concerns but they were best addressed through the detailed studies that will now take place to assess the feasibility of the unitary proposal
mr surl an independent is standing for re election as gloucestershire pcc on may alongside labour s barry kirby and the conservatives will windsor clive
the cotswolds could be policed by the thames valley force if plans to break away from gloucestershire county council go ahead it is claimed

poverty comes in many forms a middle aged man making an hour a single mother with mouths to feed a person with a criminal record and few employers willing to look past it

in massachusetts the state budget for programs that provide these services has been slashed in half in the past decade

president obama just launched an initiative to help workers upgrade skills and last month the white house held a summit with employers nonprots tech innovators and unions committed to expanding and improving educational opportunities for millions of workers
its very very very difcult to move up without accumulating higher level skills said jerry rubin chief executive of jewish vocational service a boston nonprot that provides worker training
without them people will be employed but they will be at or below the poverty line
many who have lifted themselves out of desperate situations say they could not have gotten there on their own or without a lot of effort

being tall undoubtedly has its benets
you can see in a crowd and grab objects off high shelves
but with the good comes the bad
the taller you are the higher your odds of developing cancer and a new paper has added weight to this
key points key points taller people have more cells in their body as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow for every cm over the average height a person s risk for cancer increases per cent new analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this and also nds a few specic cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height leonard nunney an evolutionary biologist at the university of california riverside looked at massive cancer databases to nd out how the number of cells in a person s body using height as a proxy might affect their risk of developing cancer
reporting in the proceedings of the royal society b he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall for every centimetres over the average height the risk of developing any cancer increased by around per cent
this ts with previous studies
if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board professor nunney said
he also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma and women specically had greater odds of developing thyroid cancer
but it does nt mean tall people should panic
now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware








a new study on cancer wo nt make for pleasant reading for tall people
consider this quote from lead researcher leonard nunney of the university of california riverside if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board he tells australia s abc
yes nunney s study in the proceedings of the royal society b suggests that taller people are at greater risk for cancer
the surprisingly simple reason they have more cells and thus more things go can wrong in those cells explains the guardian
specically the study found that cancer risk rises by for every inches people are above average feet for women and feet for men reports cnn
the ndings held true for of cancers studied
now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this and if they have any concerns to get checked says nunney
cancers of the colon and kidney were among those with the strongest correlation to height
a researcher not involved with the study says it backs up previously seen links between height and cancer taller people are more likely to develop cancer than shorter people according to a new study
the study published in the proceedings of the royal society b found that for every centimeters over the average height of a person the risk of developing cancer increases by
if you were comparing a foot guy to a basketball player who s over feet tall then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board leonard nunney an evolutionary biologist at the university of california riverside tells australia s news network
the study also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma thyroid cancer and cervical cancer
now you ca nt do anything about your height but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this and if they have any concerns to get checked nunney says
it just suggests more vigilance i think
one theory is that taller people have more cells in their bodies which encourages them to grow
but nunney also found that cancers in the skin stomach and mouth were more closely linked to height
across other cancers there s no real geographical variation he says

as the weekend drew to a close her friends kissed the text on the video above was edited on june to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving
an earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible read more
this story was updated on january to reect the more specic location of where the photographs were taken
when photographer paul nicklen and lmmakers from conservation group sea legacy arrived on somerset islandnear the larger bafn islandin the canadian arctic in late summer they came across a heartbreaking sight a starving polar bear on its deathbed
nicklen is no stranger to bears
from the time he was a child growing up in canada s far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over bears in the wild
but the emaciated polar bear featured in videos nicklen published to social media on december was one of the most gut wrenching sights he s ever seen
we stood there cryinglming with tears rolling down our cheeks he said
video shows the polar bear clinging to life its white hair limply covering its thin bony frame
one of the bear s back legs drags behind it as it walks likely due to muscle atrophy
looking for food the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by inuit shers
it nds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground
in the days since nicklen posted the footage he s been asked why he did nt intervene
of course that crossed my mind said nicklen
but it s not like i walk around with a tranquilizer gun or pounds of seal meat
and even if he did said nicklen he only would have been prolonging the bear s misery
plus feeding wild polar bears








an estimated
billion people saw the image a starving polar bear struggling across an arctic landscape
the mission was a success but there was a problem we had lost control of the narrative writes cristina mittermeier in national geographic
accompanied by a photographic team she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague paul nicklen shot videoall part of their mission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change she writes
when paul posted the video on instagram he wrote this is what starvation looks like
he also wondered if all polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint
but he did nt say climate change had killed this bear
that nuance vanished when national geographic posted the video with the subtitles this is what climate change looks like and the washington post ran a dramatic headline about gut wrenching images
people also responded dramatically expressing gratitude for validation of climate science anger the crew had nt fed the bear or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming
perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we did nt know what had happened to this particular polar bear we stood there cryinglming with tears rolling down our cheeks
that s paul nicklen s take on a video he posted in december showing a starving polar bear on an island in the canadian arctic national geographic reports
the video was shot by nicklen a biologist and contributor to national geographic during a trip with the conservation group sea legacy
it shows the bear on somerset island near the larger bafn island as it searches a garbage can for food
at one point the bear shows signs of starvation
when scientists say bears are going extinct i want people to realize what it looks like nicklen tells national geographic
bears are going to starve to death
this is what a starving bear looks like
the video has since been viewed more than
million times and nicklen says it struck a nerve

to do this they should offer a variety of ways to collect customer card details and process payments
these are often dened by your own technical expertise
it could mean providing a simple means of redirecting customers from your site to their hosted payment pages
or maybe you require a way for you to authorise payments remotely
whatever your requirement a dedicated psp should have the solutions to meet it
one size does not t all so do nt let anyone persuade you otherwise
a xed monthly fee starts at around but there are some cheaper options available starting as low as
per transaction
as a rule of thumb the higher your transaction volume the lower the unit cost
and remember to compare like with like
ask if its a complete solution with inclusive fees or whether you ll be paying the bank separately on top of that
will the psp with those oh so attractive prices charge huge set up fees for enabling services such as deferred payments a virtual terminal or subscriptions that come as standard with other psps
look beyond the headline gures and consider the overall long term operational cost of partnering with each psp
for example does the psp have limited support for fraud management the cost of imsy security could do much more damage to your bottom line than any fractional differences in rates
as an online merchant you need to make sure you can also manage them as efciently as possible
which is why an effective psp should provide you with the right reporting and administration tools to manage your merchant services


will you have access to real time transaction statements can you export valuable customer data is the reporting sophisticated enough to allow you to answer questions that can better target future sales
for








enquire about their technical solutions technically your psp must be capable of supporting all of your plans
look for genuinely competitive rates costs set up fees and cost per transaction can vary greatly between competing psps so you need to shop around for the best rates
establish if there are any upfront costs the real costs associated with accepting online card payments do not start and end at the rate quote
manage reporting and administration facilities accepting online payments is only one part of the e commerce equation
enquire about their technical support a service is not a service unless its fully backed up
find out if you would be protected against fraud when accepting card payments online fraud is potentially the biggest threat to your prots
make sure you can trust their services online the difference between a prospect and a customer is trust
look out for a full service history okay its not a car but the principle is the same
establish what your psp needs to do to meet the needs of your online merchant business
look at the pricing offered by the psp
consider the level of support you ll get from the psp
look at the tools you ll be using to manage your merchant services
consider the need for fraud management systems pms
there s no doubt that the quality of a psps fraud solution will depend upon its support for merchant services solutions in other words its ability to meet the needs of your online merchant business
check the reliability of the psps customer service

while such snacks are not necessarily healthy they do tend to be lower calorie than other candy options
if you want to buy snacks in the theater these are generally your best choice of candy
in addition to being lower calorie than other varieties they are chewier
this means they re more difcult to eat
if you take longer to nish your candy you re less likely to return to the concession stand for a second helping
twizzlers have the lowest calorie count containing only about calories
milk duds contain calories while starbursts contain calories
keep in mind if you re on a specic diet plan that restricts sugar this is not the best route for you
while these snacks are lower calorie the bulk of the calories come from sugar
many movie theaters now sell protein bars at the counter
you can also sneak one in from a nearby gas station or drug store
lower calorie protein bars may contain some ingredients you re craving like nuts and chocolate while still having some nutrients
remember to read nutritional labels
some protein bars may be misleading
in general it s best to skip bars with a lot of added sugar
swedish fish are much lower in sugar than the average movie snack
they also tend to have a tougher texture making chewing them difcult
if you slow down the pace of your eating you will eat less overall
a serving of swedish fish is about pieces roughly a large handful and contains only calories and grams of sugar
movie theater containers tend to be smaller so you may nd a container that has a single serving
if you ca nt nd a smaller container try splitting one with a friend
as it can be tricky to nd candy that s lower calorie at








go for twizzlers milk duds or starbursts

religion and government are separate and religion and abortion rights are separate
condemning someone s entire religion is cruel and divisive
not all religious people are anti choice for example it is possible for some self identied christians to be pro choice
even if the person in front of you is a aming bigot think of the nice religious people and do nt insult their religion
pro choice people have long pointed out how baby and unborn child are manipulative ways to refer to an unwanted fetus
but calling all fetuses clumps of cells is also an insensitive use of rhetoric because there are some fetuses that are truly loved and wanted and to those parents the fetus is far more special
stick with the factual term fetus
dismissing fetuses as mere clumps of cells can be deeply upsetting to people who miscarried a loved wanted fetus
do nt accidentally minimize the hardship of losing a beloved fetus
transgender men nonbinary people and some intersex people of any gender can also get pregnant
be sure not to step on the toes of transgender people as you ght for the rights of everyone with a uterus

instead of eating a ton of sugar which is tempting to do when you re tired try eating complex carbohydrates and protein
sugar can give you a rush of energy but then your energy will crash
complex carbohydrates on the other hand offer more sustained energy especially when you pair them with protein
for instance try some natural peanut butter on whole wheat bread or a piece of fruit with a slice of cheese
dehydration can lead to fatigue
therefore staying hydrated will help keep your energy up
try sipping on water throughout the day to make sure you get enough
the institute of medicine recommends that men drink cups and women drink cups of water every day
other liquids can contribute to your water intake such as juice and coffee
however drinking too much juice can pack on extra calories and cause a sugar crash so try to limit your intake
also though you can count caffeinated beverages you should nt make them the majority of the liquid you drink in a day
keeping something in your mouth such as a piece of gum can help increase your alertness
the best time for this type of trick is when you re in a meeting that you absolutely need to stay awake for

this area does not need to be perfectly square or rectangular unless you are planning on using sod instead of simply replanting your grass
drive wooden or plastic stakes around the area to be leveled
attach strings to stretch between the stakes a few inches above the ground
attach a string level to the strings to determine the high point
this will usually be your starting point and the rest of the ground will be brought to here but you can also lower some ground if that makes more sense for your project
using a tape measure and your level adjust the strings until you can see how much height needs to be added or taken away across the area you are adjusting
keep in mind that you may want to adjust the grade of your land to help combat drainage problems
your land should be graded for every leading away from your home
if you are leveling a small area and it is mostly level you probably will not need to remove the grass
however if you have a large area and a lot of leveling to do removing the grass will be much easier
a simple shovel is all that s necessary for a reasonable amount of space
depending on how much ground you have to cover and what will be going on the ground afterwards you ll need to level your land with differing mixtures of soil sand and compost manure fertilizer

for the best texture and taste insist on meat that is organic free of articial hormones
specify that you want a raw pork belly that has nt already been cured or sliced
for a fattier bacon ask for meat that came from the hogs belly chest
for a meatier bacon ask for meat that covered the hogs spare ribs
whole pork bellies typically weigh between and pounds but if you are experimenting with cure recipes ask for a smaller cut in case you end up not liking your concoction
if you purchased your pork belly from a commercial vendor other than a farm and plan on curing it as soon as you get home skip this step since the meat has already been chilled
but if you buy direct from a farm ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered because you need to chill your meat within hours of that time
in either case bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour
once home place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross contamination with other items
for a quicker chill set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest
to further reduce the chance of cross contamination set it in the meat compartment away from other products
keep the refrigerators temperature at degrees fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to degrees which will help kill bacteria
if you are chilling multiple bellies set each one in its own container rather than stacking the meat directly on top of each other
either ask your butcher to do it for you when you purchase

my cousin of course was there and he asked if i wanted to play cops and robbers
i accepted of course
now next to the side of my aunts house is a little area with a small fence a covered water tank and super duper sharp stones
my cousin who was the cop was gaining on me
i tried to jump over the fence aaand i failed the jump and went crashing onto the gravel my leg hitting the sharpest bit and then the next thing i knew it had a nasty gash
played cops and robbers with my cousin on xmas day gashed my leg failing a jump i tried to play cops and robbers and ended up with a nasty gash in my leg
this happened about years ago at my best friend s apartment
i had come over to meet our friend s new boyfriend and go out for a fun night of bar hopping and meeting up with more friends
i wanted to do my makeup and hair since i had showered before coming over and did nt have time prior
now my best friend keeps her bathroom extremely hot since she has a pet snake and it was the middle of winter


so i started to kinda sweat and remembered that i forgot deodorant and i was two seconds from smelling like a hot dude in a sauna with very poor hygiene
i start panicking and getting even more sweaty when i notice the spray bottle on a small shelf
the outside of it was black and purple i wrongly assumed it was safe to put on the ol pits and go crazy spraying them nice and good
i felt better panic attack relieved and i come out of the bathroom
fast forward maybe seconds and i start to feel like my under arm skin is slowly and mercilessly being ripped off
i m wincing in pain and the three of them are just like what


the hell i confess and tell what i did and my best friend just starts dying from laughter then goes into a t of concern because i need to get the crap off of my skin asap
i washed it off and had really really horrible chemical burns on my arm pits for about days and could nt put deodorant on for the duration while my skin healed
needless to say i sure everyone loved my natural smell for that period of time

as i was driving the dog went in and out of vision mostly biting the tires as most dogs do playing around
the owner kept asking us the two guys up front if we could see her
we said yes and kept driving
as i was driving at no more than mph along the dirt road i could hear the dog biting at the tires playfully but we just laughed it off bc we thought she was having fun

i currently have summer job working in a local amusement park in a small town within northern ireland
one of the requirements for this job is to operate the ghost train carts as they go in one door and come out the other while allowing customers on
using a operating desk with three buttons on it i am able to control when cars go in when the ones in the middle can be moved up and when the ones that have just come out the bottom with people in them can be moved up once the customer has left the cart
so


when the customer comes out the bottom door of the ghost train they are about a ft gap away from due to the space for the other carts to take up
because of this i try to make them leave their cart asap to prevent another coming out and crashing into them and some times i ll press the button to control that cart just a tad to move it so they get the idea to move out quickly
one day a woman comes out the bottom of the ghost train



and just sits there
it s a busy day i m trying to deal with a lot of customers and i have other people breathing down my neck trying to get on
i tell them i need to get this woman off before they can go on
so i hit the bottom and shunt her car while she s only starting to try and sit up she looks shocked at me
i do it again she looks even more shocked
i start staring at her implying please hurry up
you re taking your time and she slowly moves her way out of the car grabbing the bars around her and slowly

yesterday i tried to cook in a bit of a rush so i could get to work on time
i set the heat to high to heat up my noodles quickly and in my haste i did nt notice that some grease had spilled on the eye earlier in the day
i left the noodles to cook and went to the bathroom
i come back and the pot is engulfed in ames
i panicked moved the pot off of the stove and put out the re
after that i opened up the doors in the house to let it air out so the re alarm would nt go off
now i had two of my familys dogs locked up so they would nt run out
but i could nt nd the third
i had assumed that he was in my sisters room and resumed trying to save the food
well my sister came downstairs after a few minutes and was looking for her dog
turns out the dog had escaped
so i of course had to stop cooking so i could look for the dog
it took about twenty minutes to nd him and i ended up being late for work and getting chewed out by my manager
tried to cook in a rush almost burned my house down had a dog escape and ended up being late to work
tried to cook noodles ended up setting the house on re and lost my sisters dog in the process
so a little background rst i m on my school s student council and today was our junior prom assembly
we had a lot going on much of it relying on a fast internet connection to work live cameras streamed over appletv
we realized that as everyone settled into the auditorium we d have a large portion of the student body connecting to the school wi and we were worried about slowdown
our live camera was basically useless without a good internet connection so i had the bright idea to hook up the appletv to my personal hotspot
it connected automatically i ran the feed for a few seconds worked like a charm so we moved on
assembly starts about minutes in and everything is going great
i m backstage when i see our principal run up to microphone and tell everyone to exit the school immediately as there is a potential terror threat in the area i live in an area where things like this never happen we ve had one lockdown in my years of schooling here obviously everyone s more than a little worried
everyone les out myself included
as i m standing outside a friend walks up and tells us what he found out from a teacher
one of the students while trying to connect to the wi had discovered a network


my network taliban secure communications
needless to say the student went to a teacher things escalated and the school ordered a full evacuation
i talked to the principal a very very awkward conversation and got everything sorted out
everyone s parents are panicking checking their kids out of school now
my personal hotspot is now called i love school
turned on personal hotspot with the name taliban secure communications for an assembly school got evacuated because of a supposed terror threat
i connected my school s live camera to my personal hotspot one of the students found out and evacuated the school
unlike the majority of these this occurred about minutes ago i am a pc gamer which means i have a desk with tons of junk on it
sometimes i will walk in and grab a snack to eat before i start anything which this time turned out to be a nice bag of chipsticks
i sit down and was so excited to eat them that i teared open the bag
apparently these have a very low tolerance to force so as i rip them open the i watch each individual yellow stick of glory y everywhere
these not only landed in all the small keyboard gaps but in every little gap imaginable
obviously before i moved i ate each individual stick to try and minimise the situation
so i m now sitting here typing this up with a tiny dog vacuum trying clean up this mess
back of the packet does nt state the clock inside i ripped open a bag of chipsticks and they ew everywhere this started two days ago and it followed up today
so we had a new sales guy start at the ofce
i handle most of the i
t
helpdesk network admin stuff as well as work in sales its a private company
i was training him on our systems on his rst day and it got to around noon and a little bit past so we went out to lunch
chipotle we re talking about stuff getting to know each other
people always tend to ask questions about college family blah blah blah
he asks me if i had any siblings now this question is always tricky
well my sister died years ago and i m a pretty chill guy so i do nt like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie
if i have no connection whatsoever back to my real life i say if not i say
so i said i have i was the middle child growing up have nt lied yet
hbu he goes on saying he has an older sister

nice dodged a bullet
so i make sure it went off on his topic so i did nt have to lie through my teeth
i hate people feeling sorry for me compassion is nt really a trait that i have before or after
so fast forward to today when he asks me to go to lunch again today
i try to keep my distance with people who i just meet just so i do nt seem like a stage clinger
so i tell him the good place around the area and we go
this is when it gets bad

he brings back up so what do your sisters do well i say my little sister is going to school

went to work in a very corporate setting
thought that my dress shirt buttoned all the way up would be enough to conceal it but nope
boss inquires about the bruise i say yeah i do nt know where i got that they keep popping up all over my body
i then proceeded to show him bruises on my arms i was trying to climb trees whilst drunk over the weekend as a cover up
boss became concerned and said i need to see a doctor right away as it could be something more serious like leukemia
he has given me next monday off to see the doctor

a few days ago me and my younger cousin male were playing with nerf guns shooting eachother around the house
being older and more experienced with weapons i got him good quite a few times and we were having a great time
his family had bought some knock off nerf darts that seemed like a great deal until they arrived and had solid tips
so instead of feeling like a mild ick these feel like a very strong ick
now so far these darts had caused no real injuries just a bit more pain than your average nerf dart
then i foolishly decided to bring out the big guns namely a pipe i used as a blowgun that was the perfect diameter for nerf darts
i have used blowguns for a good few years and am pretty good with them in both accuracy and power so i knew to regulate my power when shooting at people
it was still more powerful so in an attempt to draw my re and catch me ammoless my cousin held a cowboy hat out from behind a doorway for me to shoot exactly like in a western
so seeing as i m shooting an innanimate object i took a deep breath and lined up my shot
i could see my other even younger cousin female in the background watching me but due to my blowgun experience i assumed she d be ne
so i let this breath go and instead of the thump of it hitting the hat my cousin crumples and runs outside crying
i follow her and she is crying and saying i shot her and her eye is blurry and its not getting better
she was being very brave given the context and i tried to console and reassure her it d be ne so

we discuss a universal version of the problem involving arbitrary preference intensities as well as incomplete and multiple comparisons
the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an impossibility theorem consistency requiring that if an object is ranked at least as high as another in two independent problems then it is ranked as high as the other in the unied problem too and self consistency a less known but intuitive property introduced in xcite which prohibits to assign a lower rank for an object with a better or equivalent performance than another can not be met simultaneously by any ranking method on the set of all problems
domain restrictions and weakening of the properties are also investigated in order to get some positive results
since self consistency is an axiom difcult to debate we can not demand consistency from a ranking method
at the rst glance it is a somewhat surprising and controversial result making the aggregation of incomplete preferences impossible
one may argue that the whole concept of paired comparisons based ranking is awed
however loss of consistency may be regarded as a necessary sacrice for dimension reduction since the outcome should be an inherently transitive ranking even from intransitive data
this interpretation is reinforced by the connection between consistency and independence of irrelevant matches which requires the relative ranking of two objects to be independent of the outcome of








assume a set of objects is given with information about their bilateral relationships allowing for incomplete and multiple comparisons as well as different preference intensities
an axiomatic approach is applied for the problem of ranking the objects
consistency requires the preservation of relative ranking if two sets of such preferences are aggregated
self consistency assigns the same rank for objects with the same performance furthermore an object should be ranked strictly higher if it shows an obviously better performance than another
it is revealed that these two properties can not be satised simultaneously
the impossibility holds under various restrictions on the domain
however a positive result emerges if only the aggregation of ranking problems with the same comparison structure is allowed for example we have two round robin tournaments

machine learning methods are used widely within high energy physics hep
one promising approach used extensively outside of hep for applications such as handwriting recognition is that of support vector machines svms a supervised learning model used with associated learning algorithms for multivariate analysis mva
developed originally in the with the current standard version proposed in xcite svms aim to classify data points using a maximal margin hyperplane mapped from a linear classication problem to a possibly innite dimensional hyperspace
however this means svms like other mva classiers have a number of free parameters which need to be tuned on a case by case basis
this motivates a number methods for ensuring the classier is sufciently generalised such that when used on an unseen dataset the performance can be accurately predicted
in this paper a brief overview of svms is given in section sec svm with an example using svms shown in section sec checker
generalisation is discussed in section sec gen with an illustrative example of how this can improve performance given in section sec
consider the problem of linear classication with the svm where the training set is linearly separable
we dene a separating hyperplane given by where the weight vector is perpendicular to the hyperplane and the bias determines the distance of the hyperplane from the origin g

a decision function dened by is used to positively and negatively classify the points in the training set
without further constraint the








we review the concept of support vector machines svms and discuss examples of their use
one of the benets of svm algorithms compared with neural networks and decision trees is that they can be less susceptible to over tting than those other algorithms are to over training
this issue is related to the generalisation of a multivariate algorithm mva a problem that has often been overlooked in particle physics
we discuss cross validation and how this can be used to improve the generalisation of a mva in the context of high energy physics analyses
the examples presented use the toolkit for multivariate analysis tmva based on root and describe our improvements to the svm functionality and new tools introduced for cross validation within this framework
support vector machines svms are one of the most promising methods for machine learning in high energy physics
svms aim to classify data points using a maximal margin hyperplane mapped from a linear classication problem to a possibly innite dimensional hyperspace

this motivates a number methods for ensuring the classier is sufciently generalised such that when used on an unseen dataset the performance can be accurately predicted
in this paper a brief overview of svms is given with an example using svms shown in section sec checker
generalisation is discussed with an illustrative example of how this can improve performance given in section sec gen

document id arxiv the pure quantum states are traditionally associated with the wave function xcite or a vector in the hilbert space xcite
the mixed quantum states are described by the density matrix xcite or the density operator xcite
there exist several representations of quantum states in terms of the tribution functions like the wigner function xcite and the husimi kano function xcite
the diagonal representation of quantum states was suggested in xcite see also xcite
it was studied and applied in xcite
in this representation a quantum state is represented in terms of weighted sum of coherent state projectors
the properties of all the quantum state representations considered are associated with the properties of the density operator which is hermitian trace class nonnegative operator
this means in particular that all the eigenvalues of the density operators must be nonnegative
in the quantum domain the multipartite systems have a specic property connected with strong correlations of the quantum subsystems
this property provides the entanglement phenomenon xcite
in the diagonal representation of the density states the weight function is an analog of the probability distribution function in the phase space
for some class of states this function is identical to the probability distribution function like in classical statistical mechanics
in xcite the tomographic probability representation of quantum states where the quantum state is associated with the so called symplectic tomogram was introduced
the tomogram is a fair probability distribution containing the same information on quantum state that the density operator does or such its characteristics as the wigner or husimi kano functions
the aim of this work








the quasidistributions corresponding to the diagonal representation of quantum states are discussed within the framework of operator symbol construction
the tomographic probability distribution describing the quantum state in the probability representation of quantum mechanics is reviewed
the connection of the diagonal and probability representations is discussed
the superposition rule is considered in terms of the density operator symbols
the separability and entanglement properties of multipartite quantum systems are formulated as the properties of the density operator symbols of the system states
the diagonal and tomographic representations of quantum states are considered
the quantum states are represented in terms of the weighted sum of coherent state projectors
in the tomographic probability representation the quantum state is associated with the so called symplectic tomogram
the tomographic probability distribution is a fair probability distribution containing the same information on quantum state that the density operator does or such its characteristics as the wigner or husimi kano functions
the aim of this work is to nd the explicit formulae realizing the connection of the diagonal and tomographic probability representations
the functions like the wigner function husimi kano function and tomographic probability distribution function are considered as symbols of the density operators of a corresponding star product scheme
the superposition rule given in terms of tomograms and in terms of weight functions of the diagonal representation where explicit kernels of the corresponding star products are employed to obtain the addition rules for the tomograms and weight functions are considered
we discuss also the formulation of the separability and entanglement properties of composed system in the tomographic probability and diagonal representations
deep neural networks dnns have been receiving ubiquitous success in wide applications ranging from computer vision xcite to speech recognition xcite natural language processing xcite and domain adaptation xcite
as the sizes of data mount up people usually have to increase the number of parameters in dnns so as to absorb the vast volume of supervision
high performance computing techniques are investigated to speed up dnn training concerning optimization algorithms parallel synchronisations on clusters w o gpus and stochastic binarization ternarization xcite
on the other hand the memory and energy consumption is usually if not always constrained in industrial applications xcite
for instance for commercial search engines e

google and baidu and recommendation systems e

netix and youtube the ratio between the increased model size and the improved performance should be considered given limited online resources
compressing the model size becomes more important for applications on mobile and embedded devices xcite
having dnns running on mobile apps owns many great features such as better privacy less network bandwidth and real time processing
however the energy consumption of battery constrained mobile devices is usually dominated by memory access which would be greatly saved if a dnn model can t in on chip storage rather than dram storage c

xcite for details
a recent trend of studies are thus motivated to focus on compressing the size of dnns while mostly keeping their predictive performance xcite
with different intuitions there are mainly two types of dnn compression methods which could be used in conjunction for better parameter savings
the








as the complexity of deep neural networks dnns trend to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data memory and energy consumption has been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications especially on mobile devices
this paper presents a novel structure based on functional hashing to compress dnns namely funhashnn
for each entry in a deep net funhashnn uses multiple low cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry
the reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly
funhashnn includes the recently proposed hashednets xcite as a degenerated case and benets from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss
we further discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi hops
on several benchmark datasets funhashnn demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy
deep neural networks dnns have been receiving ubiquitous success in wide applications ranging from computer vision to speech recognition
as the sizes of data mount up people usually have to increase the number of parameters in dnns so as to absorb the vast volume of supervision
compressing the model size becomes more important for applications on mobile and embedded devices
with different intuitions there are mainly two types of dnn compression methods which could be used in conjunction for better parameter savings
the rst type tries to revise the training target into more informative supervision using dark knowledge
the second type observes the redundancy existence in network weights and exploits techniques to constrain or reduce the number of free parameters in dnns during learning
in applications we observe hashednets compresses model sizes greatly at marginal loss of accuracy for some situations whereas also signicantly loses accuracy for others
after revisiting its mechanism we conjecture this instability comes from at least three factors
rst hashing and training are disjoint in a two phase manner i
e
once inappropriate collisions exist there may be no much optimization room left for training

rst degree relatives of affected men have a fold increased risk of pca
when or more rst degree relatives are affected or at least rst degree relatives before the age of years the family is considered a hereditary prostate cancer hpc family according to the so called johns hopkins or carter criteria

in recent years genome wide association studies have added approximately low penetrance genetic polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of pca
several polymorphisms have also been identied that are associated with serum prostate specic antigen psa the most commonly used marker for early detection of pca
an ongoing matter of debate is whether psa testing should be used for population wide screening
in a population based setting the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer erspc showed a decrease in pca mortality of in the screening arm after correction for non attendance and contamination
by contrast the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial plco found no effect of psa screening on mortality but suffered from methodological problems which severely hamper interpretation of the results

the rst four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique with one physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt
the next procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse with the physician using the bronchoscope only to conrm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simplied method described below
the remaining procedures were performed using the simplied technique after repositioning the endotracheal tube at the predetermined depth cm for males and cm for females at the incisor
all pdts were performed by a single physician and one nurse both of whom fully understood the entire procedure

document id pubmed stainless steel alloys have remained the material of choice despite the emergence of the more recent titanium composite and polycarbonate tic brackets
stainless steel alloy contains nickel chromium and other elements such as copper iron molybdenum manganese silicon and in the oral environment orthodontic brackets are subjected to mechanical and chemical damaging which results in tibility to corrosion
corrosion leads to loss of substance from the material change in its structural characteristics or loss of structural integrity
due to the electrolytic capabilities of saliva various types of brackets are commercially available and each demonstrates a unique pattern of corrosion
in soldered brackets this corrosion is due to the presence of dissimilar metals i
e
the silver solder and the stainless steel a phenomenon termed galvanic corrosion
metal injection molding mim brackets are manufactured as a single unit and therefore do not demonstrate galvanic corrosion
corrosion can have detrimental effects on the surface of stainless steel brackets due to the continuous loss of metal ions
corrosion can increase the surface roughness of the bracket which leads to elevated friction forces between the bracket and the archwire
this increase in friction results in unfavorable distribution of forces and reduces the effectiveness of archwire guided orthodontic tooth movement
moreover by means of increased stress the friction would further accelerate the corrosion process
the release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this eld
among these metal ions furthermore direct and prolonged contact of orthodontic appliances and the resulting corrosion products have been shown to cause local pain and








statement of the problem stainless steel brackets release metallic ions following the process of corrosion in the oral environment

this represents a profound impact on individuals and their families alongside the sizeable burden on employers health care systems and society in general
when chronic pain occurs it has the potential to become disease itself and subsequently chronic pain has emerged as a distinct phenomenon
management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even within nations
literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care although various health care systems may not always support this concept consistently
the current standard of care for chronic noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions pharmacology and psychological and physical therapies
opioid analgesics are often prescribed despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting their long term use in the management of chronic pain
however for many patients this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable and debilitating
only at this late stage the eld of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost years ago
the original term of dorsal column stimulation has evolved to become known as spinal cord stimulation scs
scs has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic nociceptive and neuropathic radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome fbss and complex regional pain syndrome crps
neuromodulation therapies offer a treatment option that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and








spinal cord stimulation scs applications and technologies are fast advancing
new scs technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical environment but often there is a lag period between the clinical application and the publishing of high quality evidence on safety and efcacy
recent developments will undoubtedly expand the applicability of scs allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients and may have the potential to salvage patients who have previously failed neuromodulation
already high level evidence exists for the safety efcacy and cost effectiveness level i ii of traditional scs therapies in the treatment of chronic refractory low back with predominant limb pain regardless of surgical history
more than half of all patients with chronic painful conditions experience sustained and signicant levels of pain reduction following scs treatment
although only limited evidence exists for burst stimulation there is now level i evidence for both dorsal root ganglion scs and high frequency scs that demonstrates compelling results compared with traditional therapies
the body of evidence built on traditional scs research may be redundant with newer iterations of scs therapies such as dorsal root ganglion scs high frequency scs and burst scs

as discussed during our recent demonstration of our new portfolio tracking system portrac we have completed a security system that will provide a rewall controlling access to each business unit s data
our intent is to open up the system to designated members of each business unit or others as approved by the coo or managing director of that group
in order to complete the initial setup we need to receive a listing of approved users for your business unit and their login i d
if you prefer to delegate security approval authority to someone else on your staff please let us know and we will establish procedures with them
if additional demonstrations of portrac are necessary for your group please let us know

mike here s a revised version of the option agreement
i changed the shipping dates quantity outside exercise date and the amount of the option payment
i did not change the prices since i had not discussed this with ben and could nt get the numbers to work
have there been some changes to the data sheets it appears to me that there might be a version which reects the inclusion of the low sound option
in the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed so the prices did not reect the option

kay susan i m not sure that what i told you to do in the csa annex with respect to custodians and their qualications work so for now let s keep it out and go back to our old language
sara and mark shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our csa annex language where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can hold collateral all of our triggers are based on something happening to our counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a custodian holds the colateral and fails to be creditworthy
do you have any thoughts on this at rst i thought that we should require the custodian to be a qualied institution but i m not sure that that is the right approach
let me know what you think
