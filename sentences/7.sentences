natural language processing language parsing introduction
montylingua web
media
mit
is a natural language processing engine primarily developed by hugo liu in mit media labs using the python programming language which is entitled as an end to end natural language processor with common sense liu
it is an entire suite of individual tools catering to all aspects of english text processing ranging from raw text to the extraction of semantic meanings and summary generation thus end to end
commonsense is incorporated into montylingua part of speech pos tagger montytagger as contextual rules
montytagger was previously released by hugo liu as a standalone brill styled brill pos tagger in but is now packaged with other components forming montylingua
a java version of montylingua built using jython had also been released
montylingua is also an integral part of conceptnet liu and singh presently the largest commonsense knowledge base hsu and chen as a text processor and understander as well as forming an application programming interface api to conceptnet
at the same time it had also been incorporated into minorthird a collection of java classes for storing text annotating text and learning to extract entities and categorize text written by william w
cohen in carnegie mellon university cohen
to date there were only modules specifically written to process english text using python montylingua and nltk loper and bird
nltk natural language toolkit was developed by edward loper university of pennsylvania and steven bird the university of melbourne with the main purpose of teaching computational linguistics to computer science students loper and bird
thus nltk is more of a text processing library from which text processing engines such as montylingua could be developed from rather than a suite of usable tools
this implied that montylingua could be re implemented using nltk but had not been done
another popular text processor is gate cunningham which was developed in java
the main difference between gate and montylingua is that gate is a template processing engine rather than natural language processing
conceptnet and montylingua as well as applications of conceptnet had been previously been described liu and singh
however there has not been any review since october updating the state of the art use of either conceptnet or montylingua
at the same time there has not been any review examining the roles played by montylingua and its components in recent research work especially post october
this paper aims to review the use of and roles played by montylingua and its components in research work published between october and august
the rest of this paper is organized as follows section describes the distinctive feature and main components of montylingua
in section we review research publications that were published between october and august for the role played by montylingua and its component in these research
section discusses some trends observed in these research
however it is not the aim of this paper to describe montylingua itself or the works using it at the source code level
distinctive feature of montylingua
the distinctive feature of montylingua is the coverage for all aspects of english text processing from raw input text to semantic meanings and summary generation yet each component in montylingua is loosely coupled to each other at the architectural and code level
this had enabled montylingua to be used in different contexts as a suite of tools for processing text to semantic meaning and summary generation decouple each component of montylingua for individual use using montylingua as a baseline system and substituting components to cater to specific applications
the end result of and may be the same but the approaches are philosophically different
the rest of this section will focus on the individual components making up montylingua and how and can be fulfilled
montylingua consists of six components montytokenizer montytagger montylemmatiser montyrechunker montyextractor and montynlgenerator
montytokenizer which is sensitive to common abbreviations separates the input english text into constituent words and punctuations
common contractions are resolved into their un contracted form
for example you is resolved to you are
montytagger is a penn treebank tag set marcus et al
part of speech pos tagger based on brill tagger brill and enriched with commonsense in the form of contextual rules
montylemmatiser strips any inflectional morphology from each word
that is verbs are reduced to infinite form and nouns to singular form
montyrechunker reads the pos sequence and identifies semantic phrases adjective noun verb prepositional using a series of regular expressions
montyextractor extracts phrases and subject verb object triplets from the chunked text
lastly montynlgenerator uses the output of montyextractor to generate text summaries
at code level each component resides in a file and is standalone
this feature enables each of the six components to be used individually
in some of the research articles reviewed in section below montytagger was used on its own
on the other hand it also means that each of the six components can be easily substituted to cater to specific applications
the simplest way to do this is to modify the jist method in the class montylingua file montylingua
py as follows the jist method illustrates the end to end process of montylingua
def text sentences self
tokenized
tokenize sentences tagged
tokenized chunked
tagged print chunked string
extracted
chunked return extracted the input text is tokenized tagged chunked by montytokenizer montytagger and montyrechunker respectively before phrase and subject verb object triplets are extracted by montyextractor
substituting each of these component is little more than re directing the execution to the substituted component and back
anthology of applications utilizing montylingua
six research articles were retrieved from acm digital library using montylingua as the search term
a search using google search term montylingua
pdf added another to the list consisting of doctoral dissertation masters dissertation technical reports and articles
this section will briefly describe the role of montylingua in each of these publications published between october and august in chronological order
chandrasekaran adaptive multimodal language acquisition

chandrasekaran attempted to develop a language acquisition system through multimodal input
the system tries to initiate a dialog with the users to learn nouns verbs or adjectives
text input were pos tagged by montytagger to identify nouns verbs or adjectives
athens

athens system skillicorn and vats developed in queen university canada is a mining tool for information discovery
a case study on extracting knowledge on terrorism was presented
the authors extracted clusters of information which summarized the events as of september using the search terms al qaeda and bin laden
after retrieving a list of web pages through google webapi montytagger was used to generate a list of nouns which was then filtered for a list of discriminatory nouns by comparison to the relative frequency in british national corpus www
natcorp
ox
ac

a page page jaccard similarity matrix bradeen and havey was computed using the frequencies of discriminatory nouns on each page which considered multiple search terms search terms in this case
finally a pass clustering was performed first on the entire set of retrieved web pages followed by clustering within each of the top level clusters
a list of descriptive nouns were generated for each cluster
iterative search can be done using the list of descriptors for each cluster


hyperpipes eisenstein and davis attempted to develop a human gesture classifier hyperpipes into categories deictic action other unknown using only linguistics information
a set of manually classified gestures with the corresponding transcribed speech were extracted from persons not physics or mechanically trained describing objects a latchbox a piston and a pinball machine
montylingua was used for pos tagging and stemming of the transcribed speech
a number of features were extracted from montylingua processed text including unigrams bigrams and trigrams
comparing a baseline classification where all gestures are deictic
accurate hyperpipes achieved an accuracy of
this was compared to nave bayes
and svm
this was also compared to manual classification with only audio information that is humans listening to the speech without watching the video footage which only achieved accuracy
udani et
al
noun sense induction

word sense induction refers to inferring contextual senses of an ambiguous word words with multiple meanings which is a crucial aspect of text understanding
udani et
al
attempted to advance this field by bootstrapping on the the large body of contextual information available online for sense induction of nouns
montylingua was used to tag and stem the first research result titles and snippets from google for clustering
the system was evaluated on terms and demonstrated
accuracy in noun sense induction as compared to the random chance of
accuracy


montytagger as a teaching tool light et
al
observed increasing numbers of non computer science student interested in learning about natural language processing
however these students had difficulty in understanding programming and unix to use computational linguistics tools effectively
light
al
constructed a web based interface to nine computational linguistic tools including montytagger


text processing of economics literature nee jan van eck masters dissertation at the econometric institute of erasmus university rotterdam focused on text processing of economics literature for the purpose of extracting economics relevant terms and presenting it as a concept map linking these terms van eck van eck and van den berg
montylingua was used to tokenize pos tag and stem economics literature prior to linguistics and statistical filtering for relevant terms


metafor metafor was developed as a structure generation tool to convert everyday english language into python codes liu and lieberman which is a common task for programmers who need to implement requirements into systems
montylingua was used to process input text into verb triplets which were anaphorically dereferenced using conceptnet liu and singh
programmatic entities forming the core generated codes were performed in three parts
firstly a set of semantic recognizers were used over the subject verb triplets to identify code structures such as lists quotes and if else structures
secondly actions or changes to the extracted code structures were identified which would be used to form the class functions
lastly the context of the actions were identified
that is which actions affect which objects
these programmatic entities were then used to generate python codes
although it is not likely that the generated python code is executable metafor is likely to be adopted as a brainstorming tool according to a case study done by the authors liu and lieberman
richardson and fox concept map based cross language resource learning

concept map was described by joseph novak as graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them novak and gowin which had been shown to facilitate a student learning process mcnaught and kennedy
richardson and fox examined the role of concept maps as a cross language learning resource by giving a set of articles written in spanish and their english translations to a control group of student whereas the experimental group received the same materials as the control group supplemented with concept maps produced by domain experts
the experimental group performed significantly better than the control suggesting the advantage of having a concept map
montytagger was used to extract nouns which were subsequently used to form the nodes on the concept automatically in further experiments but the authors did not evaluate the differences in the nodes of the concept maps produced by domain experts and that of montytagger


qable qable question answering behavior learner used prior learning and problem solving strategies tadepalli and natarajan in text understanding for question and answer grois and wilkins grois and wilkins
montytagger was used for both processing of text which was to be understood and the questions
a prior system deep read hirschman et al
was evaluated using remedia corpus a collection of children stories provided by remedia publications
using the same corpus qable achieved accuracy compared to by deep read grois and wilkins grois and wilkins


arizona state university bioai group in trec the text retrieval conference trec genomic track is an ad document retrieval task in different areas of instances each
the arizona state university bioai group yu et al
chose to use apache lucene lucene
apache
org to retrieve abstracts from pubmed which were pos tagged using montytagger and anaphorically resolved
facts from the processed abstracts were extracted by template matching
evaluations by trec were based on the top and retrieved abstracts respectively
yu et
al
yu et al
achieved precision and precision on the top and abstracts respectively


skillsum reiter and dale said that the goal of many nlg natural language generation systems is to produce documents which are as similar as possible to documents produced by human experts reiter and dale
one of the difficulties is to decide what goes into the generated document the context selection rules and it is also known that corpora of expert written text may not form the gold standards as expert may disagree or vary in opinions reiter and sripada
from a set of skills test results and authored evaluations skillsum attempted to derive context rules williams and reiter
montylingua was used to parse authored evaluations to identify message types geldof followed by rhetorical structure theory analysis
a trial by the authors suggested that users preferred skillsum report over basic numerical test scores reiter and dale


kennedy natsev and chang query class induction for multimodal video search one of the more sophisticated forms of search techniques is multimodal search which assumes the set of items to be searched takes on different roles and specific search techniques when applied could improve overall retrieval performance
for example a video clip in a collection could be searched by title and subject classification metadata qualities of image or contents of image visual cues dialogue or speech audio cues and subtitles text
in multimodal search an important aspect is to be able to classify the search queries and studies in multimodal video retrieval had used pre defined classes chua et al
yan et al

kennedy natsev and chang proposed a framework for multimodal search without prior need to define query classes by semantic analysis of the input query kennedy et al

montylingua was used for pos tagging and stemming of the input query before constructing it into an okapi query robertson et al

an improvement of was realized over using pre defined query classes chua et al
yan et al
by evaluating using trecvid robertson et al



memsworldonline memsworldonline zhang et al
was developed for information retrieval in domain specific digital libraries on microelectromechanical systems by using a combination of formal concept analysis priss and information anchors
information anchors are common concepts in the field which allowed for examination into community dynamics troy et al
or emerging trends kontostathis et al

for example this paper is an information anchor for montylingua topic area
other possible anchors are authors related areas of expertise and institutions research directions
information anchors essentially consists of keywords key phrases metadata and document relationships
montylingua was used in memsworldonline to extract nouns noun phrases and sub phrases in documents as one of the means to derive information anchors
these information anchors formed an ontology to classify documents


pepurs with increasing use of digital libraries comes the problem of author ambiguity torvik et al
as author names could be written in various forms of initials and more than one published authors may share the same initial
pepurs attempted to advance the field of author name clarification by analyzing author websites for publication records and segmenting these records into appropriate data fields zhang et al

each publication record is tagged twice once by a purpose built tagger and by montytagger
these were then used as input for b classifier and p classifier running in parallel to segment the publication records before merging the results from the classifiers using a decision tree mitchell
the three classifiers ran as a stacked generalization procedure wolpert


automatic construction of domain specific concept structures libo chen doctoral dissertation at technischen universitat darmstadt focused on automatic construction of domain specific concept structures chen in response to the problem of vocabulary mismatch in web search blair furnas et al
by constructing specific concepts and linking these terms
montytagger was used to pos tag web pages prior to concept extraction


red opal feature selection of online product reviews is an important aspect of online shopping liu et al

red opal scaffidi used a probability based algorithm in feature selection and comparing that to a support based algorithm liu et al

montylingua was used for pos tagging and stemming of online product reviews before processing by each of the two algorithms for feature selection
the speed of montylingua pos tagging and stemming averaged at milliseconds per review with the fastest being milliseconds on a single pentium processor with gb of ram running windows xp professional sp and sun

with mb heap size


hsu and chen commonsense query expansion for image retrieval hsu and chen investigated the usefulness of commonsense knowledge in image retrieval which had been used previously in query expansion liu and lieberman
montylingua was used for pos tagging and stemming of the initial query before commonsense query expansion by conceptnet liu and singh
from the evaluation results using the imageclef test collection clough et al
the authors concluded that introducing commonsense knowledge into the retrieval task is suitable for precision oriented tasks hsu and chen
discussion
montylingua was released in liu and was described in october with conceptnet liu and singh
in the same paper applications of conceptnet were featured
since then the state of the art use of either conceptnet or montylingua and roles played by montylingua and its components in recent research work had not been reviewed
this paper aims to review the use of and roles played by montylingua and its components in research work published between october to august
of the research reports reviewed all had used montytagger for pos tagging of them had used montylemmatiser for stemming and only metafor and memsworldonline had used montyrechunker and montyextractor
none of the reviewed work seems to have used montynlgenerator for text summarization
an interesting observation is the use of montytagger in a wide context such as web pages skillicorn and vats udani et al
transcribed human speech eisenstein and davis economics papers van eck van eck and van den berg and biomedical papers yu et al
despite the fact that montytagger was generically trained using wall street journal corpus
this might suggest that montytagger could be used in various context which is reflected in daily life where a non legally trained person might still be able to read legal text intelligently despite some inability to grasp the total meaning as appear to a legally trained person
however it had been shown that a generically trained pos tagger will perform inadequately on domain specialized text such as biomedical literature tateisi and tsuji
in spite of this montytagger had been used in specialized sitting van eck van eck and van den berg yu et al
which might suggest that the numerical measurement of pos tagging accuracy may not correlate with the functional pos tagging accuracy
for example the word book can be tagged as noun base form nn or noun singular form nns but may be treated as an error when calculating pos tagging accuracy as the quotient between the number of correctly tagged tokens and the total number of tokens
only of the systems had used montyrechunker and montyextractor
metafor had used them to gain semantic understanding of daily written language while memsworldonline used them to process domain specific text
despite a small sample size of a supportive case could be made for the use of montyrechunker and montyextractor in both generic text liu and lieberman and domain specific text zhang et al

in this review we did not observe any applications of montynlgenerator
however it is likely that text summary may have a role in future in managing the current trend of information overload
it is plausible that future research will place greater emphasis on summary generation of specific libraries as a whole or in a time striated fashion as an extension of memsworldonline
web search could use natural language generation techniques to summarize the results on the fly
natural language generation could extend metafor liu and lieberman to include automated generation source code documentation
this could then be used to identify code architectures and algorithms which is one of the problems in program optimization by algorithm replacement metzger and wen
in summary we had reviewed articles published between october and august for the roles played by montylingua or its components in these studies thereby updating the state of art utility of montylingua
we had observed a diversified use of montylingua in many different areas both generic and domain specific
although the use of the text summarizing component had not been observed we are optimistic that it will have a crucial role in managing the current trend of information overload in future research
