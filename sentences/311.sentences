sterbini abstract in this chapter we briey recall and summarize the main linear optics concepts of the accelerators beam dynamics theory
in doing so we put our emphasis on the related computational aspects the reader will be provided with the basic elements to write a linear optics code
to this aim we complement the text with few practical examples and code listings
introduction the linear optics theory was developed more than years ago and its rst success was to demonstrate the overall focusing effect of a sequence of alternating focusing and defocusing rupoles the so called alternating gradient principle
despite based on simple linear algebraic concepts the alternating gradient principle was a through in the history of accelerators
since then the linear optics design of an accelerator is the very rst step for understanding the particle motion and the foundation to study the non linear haviour of a lattice
hence the importance to acquire a solid knowledge and familiarity with its concepts and the associated numerical methods
presently the main challenges of the accelerator beam dynamics resides elsewhere e

in the description of long term behaviour of non linear tem this chapter has to be intended as an introduction to the problems and to the phenomena that will be presented in the following chapters
there is a rich bibliography covering the subject and hereby we indicated only a short and partial list of references
the reader is assumed to be already familiar with the basic concept of linear optics
the goal of the linear optics and more in general of the beam dynamics is to describe the motion of the particles traveling in the accelerator
the linear attribute refers to the assumptions or the approximation that the variation of the particle coordinates depends linearly on the coordinates themselves
to introduce the linear optics theory three equivalent directions can be followed
integrating the equations of the motion
this is the historical approach and presents several limits when trying to generalize it to non linear systems

using the hamiltonian formalism to describe the particle motion
this approach is the ural one to generalize the solutions to non linear dynamics problems

using a computational approach deriving the linear optics theory using linear algebra cepts
this is the approach behind standard linear optics codes and it is the one we will follow in this chapter

the reference system as presented in the previous paragraph the aim of the beam dynamics is to describe the particle motion along the accelerator
for doing so we need to associate to each particle a set of coordinates with respect to a specic reference system and describe their evolution in time
the number of coordinates will depend on the degrees of freedom we are considering
several reference systems can in principle be chosen e

a laboratory reference system in which we describe the phase space x px y py z pz of the particle where x y z are the three spatial coordinates of the particle and the px py and pz its momentum components
this reference system is not convenient to describe in an efcient way the particle motion in fact we can simplify the formalism by expressing the motion as relative to a given particle the reference particle
in other words we choose as reference system the one co moving with the reference particle
the coordinates y py z pz have to be intended therefore as variations with respect to the reference particle
the reference particle denes the reference orbit of the circular machine the orbit used to align the machine elements i
e
the orbit dening the geometry of the machine
in single passage machines like in a linac we will call it reference trajectory
all other dipolar contributions present in machine but not contributing in dening the circular machine geometry dene the beam closed orbit fig

it is convenient to replace as independent variable the time t with the longitudinal position s along the reference orbit trajectory
under the conditions pz where is the module of the particle momentum the phase space can be replaced with the trace space y dy ds dz ds
dx ds if not explicitly stated we will implicitly refer to the phase space and not to the trace space
in fact the phase space differently from the trace space features a conservation property that we will present in the following sections and will be central in linear optics computations

linear transformations our optics system is linear if and only if the evolution from the coordinates particle trajectory closed orbit reference orbit y z x figure reference systems
in the gure two reference systems are shown the laboratory ence system x y z in blue and the co moving reference system in black
it is worth noting that the latter depends on s the longitudinal abscissa on the reference orbit black line
the reference orbit is described by denition by the xed point with respect to the frame
the closed orbit in red see later and the single turn oscillation in orange see later are described with respect to the frame
to can be expressed as m where m is a square matrix and does not depend on or
it is important to note that we are interested only in a special set of linear transformations the so called symplectic linear transformations that is the ones associated to a symplectic matrix
in the following we will present the concept of symplectic matrix and its physical meaning
to do so we need to introduce the concept of bi linear product

the bi linear product the bi linear product between the two vectors v and u associated to the square matrix f is dened as the scalar v t f u
as an example the dot product is a bi linear product with f equal to the identity matrix
as we will see in the following it is interesting to study the properties of a linear transformations m that preserves the bi linear product associated with f
observing that v t f u m v t f m u f m t f m
we conclude that m preserves the bi linear product associated to f if and only if f m t f m
to be noted then that if m and n are preserving the bi linear product associated to f then also m n and n m preserve it therefore we can associate to a bi linear product a group of linear transformations
in the following we will present two examples the group of orthogonal and symplectic matrices


example
the orthogonal matrix let us consider for simplicity the case that is u and v va
assuming the bi linear transformation i is the dot product between v va and u f i v t i f u vaua vbub
a matrix m preserves the bi linear transformation i then the projections if and only if i m u v t i u m t i m i v t m t m v t then m is called orthogonal matrix
the physical meaning of the orthogonal matrix lies in the fact that it preserves the projection between vectors e

any rotation can be expressed as an orthogonal matrix


example
the symplectic matrix assuming f v t f u vaub vbua the bi linear transformation is proportional to the amplitude of the cross product between v va and u that is proportional to the area dened by the vectors
a matrix m preserves the bi linear formation related to the cross product if and only if v t m t m u v t u m t m then m is called symplectic matrix
the physical meaning of the symplectic matrix lies on the fact that it preserves the area between two vectors
in fig
we can see a graphical representation of an orthogonal and a symplectic linear formation
comparing two generic vectors between the identity transformation upper plot and the orthogonal transformation middle plot one can note that their dot product is conserved
in the symplectic transformation lower plot given a set on n vectors dening a polygon the face of the polygon is preserved
for that reason a symplectic linear transformation preserves the phase space areas
behind this concept lies a much more general theorem of classical mechanics and the phase space the liouville theorem
all the concepts we introduced so far can be generalized from the to nd
in particular becomes a matrix




an example of symplectic matrix in not block symplectic is the following it is worth recalling some important properties of the symplectic group as already mentioned if and are symplectic then m is symplectic too
identity transformation a coordinate arb
units orthogonal transformation a coordinate arb
units s t i n u b r a
t a n i r o o c b s t i n u
b r a e t a n i r o o c b s t i n u b r a
t a n i r o o c b symplectic transformation a coordinate arb
units figure examples of identity orthogonal and symplectic transformations
if m is symplectic then m t is symplectic
every symplectic matrix is invertible m m t and m is symplectic
therefore an inversion of a symplectic matrix can be very efcient in term of computational cost
a necessary but not sufcient condition for m to be symplectic is that
for the case this condition is necessary and sufcient
an example of not symplectic matrix m with is the following

there are symplectic matrices that are defective that is they can not be diagonalized e


symplectic matrix and accelerators from the concept of symplectic transformation we can dene the basic building blocks that stitute all the linear transformation in an accelerator
in particular we can consider the following three matrices g l g drift thin quad thin telescope
among the above matrices one can recognise the l long drift and the thin quadrupole with focal length
in addition there is also the thin telescope matrix
this matrix reduces to the identical transformation for g but for g introduces a discontinuity in the position coordinate while the other thin matrix the thin quadrupole introduces a discontinuity on the momentum coordinate thin kick
conveniently combining drifts and thin quadrupole one nd back also the well known matrices for the thick elements


example
a thick quadrupole one can derive the transfer matrix of a thick quadrupole of length l and normalized gradient by decomposing it in n identical optics cells
each cell is constituted by a drift and a l n thin quadrupole with focal length quadrupole matrix by solving the following limit n l
from this decomposition one can obtain the thick lens lim n l n cos l n n sin sin cos to compute the above limit and in general for symbolic computations one can prot of the available symbolic computation tools e

mathematica or the python package sympy
an example of symbolic calculation of the above limit is given in listing
we established a correspondence between elements along our machine drift bending rupoles solenoids


and symplectic matrices
for a rich list of matrix transformations in an accelerator refer to the appendix in

tracking in a linear system given a sequence of elements


mk the lattice the evolution of the coordinate xn along the lattice for a given particle can be obtained as xn mn


for n
the transport of the particles along the lattice is called tracking
the tracking on a linear tem is trivial and as we will show in the following unnecessary
in fact we will decompose the trajectory of the single particle in term of invariant of the motion and properties of the lattice
via those properties we will describe not only the trajectory of the single particle but also the statistical evolution of an ensemble of particles the beam
so instead of tracking an ensemble of particles we will concentrate to dene and compute the properties of the lattice on one hand and of the beam on the other hand
linear lattices
periodic lattice and stability we study now the motion of the particles in a periodic lattice that is lattice constituted by a denite repetition of the same basic c long period
we represent with mot m the so called turn map that is the linear matrix of a single turn
due to periodicity we have mot m mot m c
from eq
we get xm m m ot m where we used the subscript m to refer to the turn number
in the following we study the property of mot m to have stable motion in the lattice that is there is always a x such that for all and m
in other words to verify if the lattice is stable we need to verify that all the elements of the matrix ot m stay bounded for all m
to solve this problem we use in the following three equivalent m m factorization forms diagonal factorization r factorization and twiss factorization


diagonal factorization if mot m can be expressed as a diagonal factorization e

in diagonal form mot m p d p after m turns we have that m m ot m p dp p dp p dp p dmp
therefore the stability depends only on the eigenvalues of mot m
note that if v is an eigenvector also kv is an eigenvector
therefore p is not uniquely dened we chose p such that i
there is not an physical meaning behind this tion but as it will appear clearly later it is convenient since is compatible with standard denitions of the accelerator dynamics
it is worth recalling the following properties for a real matrix the eigenvalues if complex appear in complex conjugate pairs
for a symplectic matrix mot m where i are the eigenvalues of mot m
i i therefore for symplectic matrix the eigenvalues can be written as eiot m and eiot m without loss of generality we consider ot m
this implies that dm m
therefore a power of a matrix is reduced to a simple scalar multiplication
if is real then the motion is stable and we can dene the fractional tune of the periodic
we will describe in section

how to compute the total phase advance of the ot m lattice as machine and therefore the integer tune


r factorization the diagonal factorization we introduced is convenient to check the stability but not to visualize the turn by turn phase space evolution of the particle
to do that it is worth considering the factorization mot m p cos ot m sin ot m sin ot m cos ot m m is orthogonal p
if mot m can be diagonalized then can be expressed also in a r factorization
in fact to go from diagonal factorization to r factorization we note that cos ot m sin ot m sin ot m cos ot m m i i m eiot m m i i s where we introduced the matrix s
therefore one can easily express p as function of p and s observing that rm m
mot m p s d s r p p i
e
p p s
we note that by choosing det p i we got det p that is we expressed m as the product of orthogonal and symplectic matrices
this result is very relevant since it implies that the mot m is similar to a pure rotationv
that is with a convenient change of base expressed by the matrix p we can move from the physical phase space to the normalized phase space where the periodic motion is just a clockwise rotation of the angle ot m


twiss factorization of mot m we note that m cos ot m sin ot m yielding the so called twiss factorization mot m p i p i cos ot m p p j sin ot m
it is worth observing that j has three properties



the last two expressions can be proved using the symbolic computation as show in listing
the following parametric expression of j has been proposed dening the twiss parameters of the lattice at the start of the sequence mot m
it is very important to not that they are not depending on the turn number m since m m ot m i m j m
in other words the twiss parameters in a stable periodic lattice are periodic
from the ition of j j p p we can express p p and p as function of the twiss parameters p j p c c c figure similarity of two one turn map matrices referred to two different points and
and p p i i
to summarise if the matrix mot m is diagonalizable and if the lattice is stable and
from the eigenvector matrix p conveniently normalized with its fractional tune is det p i and from eq
one can nd the twiss parameters of the lattice at the mot m starting point
in listing an example for computing the optical functions at the mot m starting point is shown

twiss parameters along the machine given a c long periodic lattice and two longitudinal positions and as depicted in fig
the transformation from to c can be expressed as where m is the transport matrix from to
this implies mot m m m mot m mot m m mot m m that is the matrices mot m and mot m are similar and therefore they have the same genvalues
from this observation it yields that the mot m is s dependent but the tune is not


and transport we observe that and are s dependent functions
in fact we have mot m m mot m m m i cos ot m sin ot m m therefore m m
from eq
inverse of a symplectic matrix we have m m t that is m m t
equation allows us to propagate the initial condition of the optical functions and along the lattice
it is worth noting that from eq
and remembering the denition of the p matrix the one to transform the physical phase space in the normalized phase space we get p p hence in the normalized phase space and are and respectively


example
the function in a drift to compute the twiss parameters in a drift starting from and we can simply apply the previous equation s s yielding and


the differential relation between and up to now we discussed how to compute the and at the start of the lattice and and how to propagate them along the lattice
we would like now to investigate if there is a differential relation between these two functions of the s position
we consider the general m matrix for the innitesimal quadrupole of length s m s
note that m is just the product of a drift of length s and a thin focusing quadrupole of gradient where we neglected the second order terms of s
m is then symplectic only for s
from eq
we have that s s m m t
s s observing that lim s s where we used standard notation and replacing eq
in eq differentialj one obtains df ds

replacing and in the latter equation with functions of it yields the non linear differential equation it is important to note that even if we are discussing linear optics the differential equation between and k is strongly non linear
therefore in order to avoid the linear tracking and to decompose the problem in properties of lattice and properties of the beam we introduced new functions of the s positions that are related by a non linear differential equation to the lattice gradients


example
from matrices to hill s equation following the notation already introduced s m with t therefore x one can nd back the hill s equation lim s s starting from a pure matrix approach where we did not mentioned lorentz force at all
this shows the full equivalence of the two formalisms

courant snyder invariant up to now we showed how to compute the optics functions of the lattice that is functions ent on the particle initial conditions
in this section we are going to investigate given a particle with initial coordinate x if and how we can dene a x dependent quantity that is conserved ing the motion of the particle in the machine
this invariant exists and is called courant snyder invariant or action of the particle
it is dened as jcs x t j x
we can show in fact from eq
that x t j jcs x t m t m m t m x t j jcs that is
to be noted that in the invariant of motion is dened as jcs
in the normalized phase space remembering that x p x we have x t j x x t p t j p i x x t x that is the jcs is half of the square of the radius dened by the particle initial position in the normalized phase space
the angle of the particle is dened as the the particle initial angle in the normalized phase space and polar coordinates
hence the normalized phase space is also called action angle space
from listing going from the matrix form to the polynomial form one nds back the denition of the invariant jcs as function of the optics functions it is worth noting that under the assumptions of trace space and phase space equivalence see section
the invariant of motion can also be expressed in the trace space variables as jcs xpx
j tracespace cs
to be noted that eq
is not equivalent from a dimensional point of view to eq

despite it for the sake of simplicity and consistency with the existing conventions we will use the same symbol jcs for both invariants


the betatron phase in normalized space we just observed that the transport from s to s s does not change jcs but the angle varies by s
what is the introduced by a linear matrix m to compute it we consider the normalized phase space p and s p s s and from it yields s m s p s m p
cos sin sin cos from the previous equation one gets tan sin cos it does depend only on and in s that is the phase advance from s to s s that is the end of the m transformation
the integer tune of the circular machine of length c is dened as therefore it represents the number of betatronic oscillations between s and s c
it is worth noting that between the ot m e

eq
and the following relation holds ot m where n represents the integer number of betatronic periods in the machine


example
the differential equation of from the previous equation if m one gets s lim tan s lim s that is the well known expression d
s trace space trace space m m x


mm x
m m x


mm x
s p p s trace space trace space







figure betatron oscillations from to in the physical and normalized trace spaces referred as x and x respectively
in this example we assumed a tune of ot m and a phase advance between and of
to be noted that all the transformations between these trace spaces are symplectic therefore the positions represented in the gure have the same jcs
the number of the markers indicates the turn number


example
the betatron oscillations we can describe a betatron oscillation from to in terms of the twiss parameters and the particle initial conditions
this can be easily done by transforming the vector x in the normalized phase space in moving it from to in the normalized space pure rotation of the phase and back transform it in the original phase space as shown in fig

this is a very important result since it implies that the motion of the particle is a pure rotation in the normalized phase space also along the machine this generalizes the result obtained from the r factorization of the mot m
as show in the listing one can express the m matrix as function of the optics function at and yielding m p p cos sin cos sin sin cos sin


example
solution of hill s equation remembering the important result that motion of the particle is a pure rotation in the normalized phase space also along the machine we can express the motion of the particle from its initial condition in the normalized phase space i
e
action and initial phase that is jcs and
from the denition of jcs it follows that the radial position of the particle in the normalized phase space and is angular position has a phase in addition to the initial phase
remembering is that for positive the rotation is clockwise one gets jcs jcs p jcs
this is indeed the solution of the hill s equation given the particle initial conditions jcs and

example
from the co matrix to the co formula
up to now we implicitly assumed that the closed orbit co corresponded to the reference orbit
this is not always true
in fact during the machine operation one can switch on dipole correctors additional to the ones dening the alignement of the magnetic elements
assuming a mot m and a single thin kick at independent from xm we can write mot m
in the case can represent a kick of a dipole correction or misalignment of a quadrupole
the closed orbit solution can be retrieved imposing xm xed point after turn yielding i mot m
from the eq
we can nd the xed point in
please note that the co is discontinuous in so the previous formula refers to the co after the kick
solving the eq
and transporting the xed point from to s using eq
as shown in listing we found back the known equation of the closed orbit q where is the phase advance from to s
we can relax the last condition by replacing with
in presence of multiple one can sum the single contributions along s

computing dispersion and chromaticity up to now we considered all the optics parameters for the on momentum particle
to evaluate the off momentum effect of the closed orbit and the tune we introduce the dispersion dx and chromaticity x y functions respectively as p dx y s dx c p p and qx y x y p p
in order to compute numerically the dx y and x y we can compute the cox y and the qx as function of
to do that we have to compute mot m s that is evaluating the property of p the element of the lattice as function of p
in a thin quadrupole the focal length linearly scales with the particle momentum p p p

the beam distribution the beam can be considered as a set of n particles fig

to track n particles we can use the same approach of the single particle tracking were x becomes xb a n matrix xb


xn we will restrict ourselves to the case n
we are looking for one or more statistical quantities that represents this ensemble and its evolution in the lattice
a natural one is the average jcs over the ensemble from the denition it follows that the quantity is preserved during the beam evolution along the linear lattice


the beam emittance we will see that converges under specic assumptions see later to the rms emittance of the beam n n jcs i det n xbx t b matrix
one can see that the is preserved for the symplectic linear transformation m from to where xbx t b represents the beam matrix
n see cauchy binet theorem det n xbx t b n xbx t b where xb denotes
therefore we have that m t det m det n xbx t b det m t m m t and this transport equation is very similar to the one in eq

trace space n n n n xixi ixi n n n n i i rms rms and therefore we can write
to summarize from the transport equation of the matrix eq
and from the its statistical meaning eq
we showed how to numerically transport the second order moments of the beam distribution

matched beam distribution a beam distribution is matched in to the specic optics functions and if the responding normalized distribution xb p is statistically invariant by rotation
in other words xb has an azimuthal symmetry therefore and
an example of matched and mismatched beams are presented in fig
and respectively
it is worth noting that m x


x m
figure a mismatched beam in the normalized phase space
since p is a symplectic matrix and for a matched beam we have xb x t b p p n rms rms
we can conclude that the normalized matrix is diagonal
for a beam distribution matched to the specic optics functions and we have p p where we found back the rms beam size and divergence formulas ively
from eqs
and one can conclude that if the beam is matched in the position then is matched in all s
this implies that the second order statistical moments of a matched beam in a periodic stable lattice and at given position s are a turn by turn invariant
and before concluding this chapter we demonstrate that for matched beam we have
this is straightforward in the normalized phase space in fact from eq
and since the beam is matched then yielding jcs

conclusion in this chapter we recalled and summarized the main linear optics concepts of the accelerators beam dynamics theory with emphasis on the related computational aspects
using a pure linear algebra approach and via symplectic matrices transformations we introduced the concepts of lattice stability optics functions normalized phase space and invariant of motions
in addition to the dynamics of the single particle we studied the ensembles of particles presenting the statistical invariant of the ensemble and the concept of beam matching
