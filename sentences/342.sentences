v i x r a abstract given a document and a target aspect e

a topic of interest aspect based abstractive summarization attempts to generate a mary with respect to the aspect
previous ies usually assume a small pre dened set of aspects and fall short of summarizing on other diverse topics
in this work we study rizing on arbitrary aspects relevant to the ument which signicantly expands the cation of the task in practice
due to the lack of supervision data we develop a new weak supervision construction method and an aspect modeling scheme both of which integrate rich external knowledge sources such as net and wikipedia
experiments show our proach achieves performance boosts on marizing both real and synthetic documents given pre dened or arbitrary aspects
introduction remarkable progresses have been made in ating generic summaries of documents nallapati et al
see et al
narayan et al
partially due to the large amount of supervision data available
in practice a document such as a news article or a medical report can span multiple topics or aspects
to meet more specic mation need in applications such as personalized intelligent assistants it is often useful to rize a document with regard to a given aspect i

aspect based summarization
recent research has explored the problem of aspect based abstractive summarization krishna and srinivasan frermann and klementiev
a key challenge of the task is the lack of rect supervision data containing documents paired with multiple aspect based summaries
previous studies have created synthetic data from generic and data available at
tanyuqian aspect based summarization news summarization corpora which have a small set of aspects e

sports health and other aspects in frermann and klementiev
as a result models trained on these data tend to be restricted to the pre dened set and fall short of summarizing on other diverse aspects
this paper aims to go beyond pre dened aspects and enable summarization on arbitrary aspects evant to the document
the arbitrary aspect may not be explicitly mentioned but only implicitly lated to portions of the document and it can be a new aspect not seen during training
to this end we develop a new approach that integrates rich external knowledge in both aspect modeling and weak supervision construction
specically we derive weak supervisions from a generic rization corpus where the conceptnet knowledge graph speer et al
is used to substantially pand the aspect scope and enrich the supervisions
to assist summarization model to better understand an aspect especially a previously unseen one we augment the model inputs with rich aspect related information extracted from wikipedia
our approach is compatible with any neural encoder decoder architectures
in this work we use the large pre trained bart model lewis et al
and ne tune with the proposed method
periments on real news articles show our approach achieves performance boosts over existing methods
when adapting to the previous synthetic domain the bart model after ne tuning with our weak supervisions becomes substantially more data cient and outperforms previous best performing systems greatly using only
training examples

summaries of interest
early work has studied aware summarization in the multi document ting with typically small datasets containing tiple documents tagged with a relevant topic dang conroy et al

for single document aspect based summarization extractive methods were used to extract related key sentences words from the document lin and hovy
our work studies abstractive aspect based tion that generates summaries
deutsch and roth studied a sub task of learning to select formation in documents that should be included in the summary
recent work frermann and tiev krishna and srinivasan on the problem synthesized training data that use news categories as the aspects and thus have a small pre dened set of aspects available
we aim to able summarization on any aspects and develop new weak supervisions by integrating rich external knowledge
aspect based summarization has also been plored in the customer reviews domain hu and liu where product aspects customer timent and sometimes textual summaries are tracted popescu and etzioni wang and ling angelidis and lapata
query based summarization produces a summary in response to a natural language query question daum iii and marcu liu et al
xie et al
which differs from abstract aspects
incorporating knowledge through weak sion has primarily been studied in classication or extraction problems hu et al
peng et al
ratner et al

for example hu et al
creates soft labels from a logical rule hanced teacher model to train neural classiers
this work explores weak supervisions in the ation setting
automatic creation of data sions also links our work to text data augmentation in either heuristic based wei and zou or automated manner sennrich et al
hu et al

this work embeds rich structured edge in the data synthesis process
approach given a document and an aspect which can be a word or a phrase the task aims to generate a mary that concisely describes information in the document that is relevant to the aspect
we present our approach that enables a neural summarization model to summarize on any aspects
the aspect can be any words relevant to but not necessarily ring in the document
our approach incorporates rich external knowledge sources including ceptnet for enriching weak supervisions in training sec
and wikipedia for advising the aspect relation to improve comprehension sec

figure shows an overview of our approach
an advantage of our approach is that it is ible with any neural summarization architectures such as the popular encoder decoders
this enables us to make use of the large pre trained network bart lewis et al
on which we apply our approach for ne tuning and improved inference

knowledge enriched weak supervisions usually no direct supervision data is available
we start with a generic summarization corpus
ically in this work we use the cnn dailymail hermann et al
which consists of a set of document summary pairs
our approach structs weakly supervised examples by cally extracting potential aspects and synthesizing aspect based summaries from the generic summary

words each resulting aspect and its aspect based summary are then paired with the document for training
extracting aspects given a generic summary we want to extract as many aspects as possible so that the summarization model can see sufcient examples during training
on the other hand the aspects must be relevant to the generic summary to facilitate synthesizing appropriate summary in the next step
to this end we rst apply a named entity recognition ner to extract a set of entities mentioned in the generic summary
these entities serve as a seed set of aspects
we then augment the seed set by collecting each entity s neighbor concepts on the conceptnet knowledge graph as these concepts are semantically closely related to the entity and thus the generic summary
for example in figure insect is a new pect from conceptnet given the seed entity bees
synthesizing aspect based summaries for each aspect we synthesize a specic summary by extracting and concatenating all relevant sentences from the generic summary
we make use of ceptnet in a similar way as above
specically a sentence is considered relevant if it mentions the aspect or any of its neighbors on conceptnet
the use of conceptnet greatly augments the supervisions in terms of both the richness of aspects and the informativeness of respective summaries

knowledge aided aspect comprehension the summarization model is required to precisely locate information in the document that matches the desired aspect
such comprehension and ing can be challenging especially with only noisy weak supervisions during training
our approach facilitates the inference by informing the model with pre computed document aspect relations
concretely we extract words from the document which are most related to the aspect more details below and feed those words into the model gether with the aspect and document
in this way the model is advised which parts of the document are likely to be aspect related
for the bart tecture we use an input format as where s is a special token for separation
to determine the related words the intuition is that the words should be describing or be associated with the aspect
we use the wikipedia page of the aspect for ltering the words
besides we want
io models xx to select only salient words in the document for a concise summary
thus we rst rank all words in the document by tf idf scores and select top words that occur in the aspect s wikipedia
experiments setup we construct weak supervisions from k out of k summary pairs in the training set of the cnn dailymail dataset mann et al

we use the cnn pretrained bart lewis et al
provided by fairseq ott et al
as our base tion model and ne tune with our approach plemented using texar hu et al

we use adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of and beam search decoding with a width of

studies on synthetic domain we rst study on the synthetic data ma news introduced in frermann and klementiev
although its aspects are restricted to only grained topics the synthetic domain facilitates tomatic evaluation providing a testbed for parison with the previous models and studying the generalization ability of our weak supervision approach when adapting to the new domain
specically ma news is synthesized from cnn dailymail by interleaving paragraphs of inal documents belonging to different aspects
the assembled document is paired with each nent s aspect and generic summary to form an aspect based summary instance
the dataset has k examples in train dev test sets spectively and contains pre dened aspects cluding sport health travel news ence technology tv showbiz
comparisons with previous methods we rst compare our approach with the previous rization models as shown in table
in the rst block sf is the best model in frermann and klementiev with a customized neural chitecture and is trained with the full ma news in the second block we also training set
train the large bart model with the ma news training set either using the full k instances or only k instances
bart trained with the full set unsurprisingly shows much better results than sf yet the one with the k subset falls hind sf

news sup sup sup ma news k ours document in an exclusive interview with breitbart news republican presidential nominee donald trump blasted bill clinton s suggestion that the united states use syrian refugees to rebuild detroit
the populist billionaire denounced clinton s suggested proposal as crazy and unfair to american workers who are already living there and are in need of jobs
it s very unfair to the people that are living there
i think it s crazy trump told breitbart on thursday
i mean these people





there are plenty of people in detroit who you could almost look at as refugees carson said
i mean we need to take care of our own people
we need to create jobs for them
clinton s suggestion that the u
s
ought to give detroit jobs to foreign refugees came during a february discussion at the clinton global initiative with chobani billionaire and mass migration enthusiast hamdi ulukaya
the truth is that the big loser in this over the long run is





a pretty good deal
during the discussion clinton praised ulukaya for his efforts to ll his yogurt plants with imported foreign refugees
ulukaya suggested that the u
s
ought to be taking in more refugees and said that he was proud of turkey s decision to accept million syrian refugees
ulukaya told clinton that syrian refugees bring avors to the community just like in


twin falls idaho where ulukaya s yogurt factory is based
clinton s controversial suggestion that





millions of more illegal immigrants thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness
according to pew polling data hillary clinton s plan to expand immigration is opposed by at least percent of the american electorate voters whom clinton has suggested are racist for opposing immigration
according to a september rasmussen survey percent black voters oppose clinton s refugee agenda to admit more than middle eastern refugees with less than one percent of black voters
percent in favor of her refugee plan

table generated summaries of a document on different aspects
document content relevant to specic aspects is highlighted in respective colors
related words identied through wikipedia sec
are highlighted in bold
as in previous work kryscinski et al
ermann and klementiev the criteria include accuracy coherence between the aspect and the summary informativeness factual correctness and relevance of the summary with regard to the document and uency language quality of vidual sentences and the whole summary
the pearson correlation coefcient of human scores is
showing moderate inter rater agreement
table shows the averaged scores and figure shows the proportions of model outputs receiving high scores in terms of the three criteria
we can see our weakly supervised method performs best
the model trained on the k ma news ples though performs well on the ma news test set table fails to generalize to the broader set of diverse aspects showing the importance of troducing rich knowledge in supervisions and ference process for generalization
interestingly ne tuning our model with k ma news instances results in inferior performance showing the vious synthetic data with limited aspects could strict generalization to other aspects
table shows example summaries by our weak sup model
given an arbitrary aspect e

an entity or a word the model correctly identies the related portions in the document and generates a relevant short summary
it is also noticeable that our approach identies meaningful related words using wikipedia as described in sec
which help with precise summarization
conclusions this paper studies the new problem of summarizing a document on arbitrary relevant aspects
to tackle the challenge of lacking supervised data we have developed a new knowledge informed weakly pervised method that leverages external knowledge bases
the promising empirical results motivate us to explore further the integration of more nal knowledge and other rich forms of supervisions e

we do nt know who these people are
we have no idea
this could be the all time great trojan horse
we have no idea who they are
the whole thing is ridiculous
number one we should build safe zones over in syria that s what we should have and we should have the gulf states fund them
it s just crazy
we ought to be building safe zones in syria and not taking these people in whether it s detroit or anywhere else
and former gop presidential contender ben carson echoed trump s sentiment in a friday interview on breitbart news daily on siriusxm patriot channel
carson explained that we need to take care of our own people and noted that the policies of democrat politicians have turned many americans living in detroit into refugees in their own country
there are plenty of people in detroit who you could almost look at as refugees carson said
i mean we need to take care of our own people

the syrian migrant crisis is an enormous opportunity for americans clinton said in february
detroit has empty structurally sound houses
and lot of jobs are to be had repairing those houses
detroit just came out of bankruptcy and the mayor s trying to do an innovative sort of urban homesteading program there
but it just gives you an example of what could be done
and i think any of us who have ever had any personal experience with either syrian americans or syrian refugees think it s a pretty good deal
during the discussion clinton praised ulukaya for his efforts to ll his yogurt plants with imported foreign refugees
ulukaya suggested that the u

ulukaya told clinton that syrian refugees bring avors to the community just like in


twin falls idaho where ulukaya s yogurt factory is based
clinton s controversial suggestion that u
s
give detroit jobs to imported foreign refugees has received virtually no media coverage outside of breitbart news
during his wednesday immigration policy address trump challenged the media to begin asking hillary clinton to explain her radical immigration platform
the media needs to begin demanding to hear hillary clinton s answer on how her policies will affect americans and their security


these are matters of for our country and its people and we deserve answers from hillary clinton


what we do know despite the total lack of media curiosity is that hillary clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement
the result will be millions of more illegal immigrants thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness

document the palestinian authority ofcially became the member of the international criminal court on wednesday a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories
the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague in the netherlands where the court is based
the palestinians signed the icc s founding rome statute in january when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem since june
later that month the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis
as members of the court palestinians may be subject to counter charges as well
israel and the united states neither of which is an icc member opposed the palestinians efforts to join the body
but palestinian foreign minister riad al malki speaking at wednesday s ceremony said it was a move toward greater justice
as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice he said according to an icc news release
indeed today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace
judge kuniko ozaki a vice president of the icc said acceding to the treaty was just the rst step for the palestinians
as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute
these are substantive commitments which can not be taken lightly she said
rights group human rights watch welcomed the development
governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure and countries that support universal acceptance of the court s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership said balkees jarrah international justice counsel for the group
what s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice not palestine s decision to join a treaty to which over countries around the world are members
in january when the preliminary icc examination was opened israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage saying the court was overstepping its boundaries
the united states also said it strongly disagreed with the court s decision
as we have said repeatedly we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc the state department said in a statement
it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations
we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said
but the icc begs to differ with the denition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as palestine
while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides
prosecutor fatou bensouda said her ofce would conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality
the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than people dead

nadella believes in making microsoft more driven by a sense of purpose in he said was to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more
and he has encouraged the company
under nadella microsoft has taken the focus off windows and the pc and pinned its hopes to the rise of its azure and ofce products as the company s older businesses stagnate
while this approach has nt translated to huge revenue growth it has revitalized the company s image

document ofcials have discovered that islamic state jihadis have been using a chemistry laboratory at mosul university to make bombs used by isis jihadists throughout the region
the university of mosul is the best daesh research center in the world gen

trainees go to raqqa then to mosul university to use the existing facilities
isis hijacked university chemistry lab in mosul for making bombs https
by pic
twitter
wsj think tank april they have found chemical bombs and suicide bomb vests like the ones used in the brussels attacks and by at least some of the paris attackers
the lab also contained explosives and chemical weapons
however ofcials told the outlet they do not know how much of the facility remains intact currently
the united coalition bombed the university in march
alumni said the university boasted a strong reputation around iraq for its science departments
a year ago the islamic state established a research hub in the chemistry lab
the terrorist group kept the staff at the university many who specialized in organic industrial and analytical chemistry
a raid in syria in march killed islamic state s abd mustafa also known as haji imam
he taught physics in iraq before he joined in
ofcials put him in prison but released him in
then he traveled to syria where he eventually joined the islamic state
gen
magsosi said the group places imam as the top expert at the mosul bomb lab
the sources told the journal that the islamic state used one part of the university for explosives and another for suicide bombs
the wall street journal reports during the same time frame there has been a surge in islamic state s use of bombs that mix chemical precursors into an explosive powdery substance known as triacetone triperoxide or tatp both in iraq and europe
it is nt clear how many of these weapons if any can be traced to research or training conducted in mosul
gen
magsosi says that his units called explosives the satan recipe because they are very hard to detect and they are usually so lethal
the islamic state captured mosul iraq s second largest city in june
since then they have destroyed libraries and buildings at the university
kurdish outlet rudaw reported last october that the group destroyed the university s faculty of agriculture buildings
in december isis raided the central library of mosul to destroy all books
these books promote indelity and call for disobeying allah announced a militant to the residents
so they will be burned
the library was the biggest repository of learning the northern iraqi town
the terrorists destroyed iraq newspapers dating to the early century maps and books from the ottoman empire and book collections contributed by about of mosul s establishment families
after that raid the isis militants targeted the library at the university of mosul
they burned science and culture textbooks in front of the students
according to the boston globe a university of mosul history professor who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the islamic state said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries last month
he reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a sunni muslim library the library of the latin church and monastery of the dominican fathers and the mosul museum library with works dating back to bc
citing reports by the locals who live near these libraries the professor added that the militants used to come during the night and carry the materials in refrigerated trucks with license plates
