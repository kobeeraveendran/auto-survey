the mobius disjointness conjecture let x t x be a ow namely x is a compact topological space and t x x a continuous map
the sequence is observed in x if there is an and an x such that t nx
let be the mobius function that is is if n is not square free and is if n is a product of t distinct primes
we say that is linearly disjoint from x if n xnn as n
for every observable of x
the mobius disjointness conjecture of the second author states the following
conjecture
the mobius disjointness conjecture
the mobius function is linearly disjoint from every x whose entropy is
this conjecture has been established for many ows x see however all of these ows are quasi regular or rigid in the sense that the birkho averages n xnn
exist for every observed in x
in we establish some new cases of the disjointness conjecture and in particular for irregular ows x that is ones for which
fails
these ows are complicated in terms of the behavior of their individual orbits but they are distal and of zero entropy so that the disjointness is still expected to hold

the mobius function distal ow ane linear map skew product nilmanifold

results in this section we summarize the results we have established in
the rst result in is concerned with certain regular ows namely ane linear maps of a compact abelian group x
such a ow t x is given by t ax
where a is an automorphism of x and x see
theorem

let x t x be an ane linear ow on a compact abelian group which is of zero entropy
then is linearly disjoint from x
theorem
actually holds with a rate of convergence
we rst reduce to the torus case and then handle the torus case by fourier analysis and classical results of davenport and hua on exponential sums concerning the mobius function
the ows in theorem
are distal and our main result in is concerned with nonlinear distal ows on such spaces
we restrict to x the two dimensional torus and consider nonlinear smooth or even analytic skew products as discussed in furstenberg
t is given by t y ax cx
where a c z ad r and h is a smooth periodic function of period
the ane linear part is in the form a c ensuring that t has zero entropy and it can always be brought into this form
the ow t is distal and this skew product is a basic building block with continuous in furstenberg s classication theory of minimal distal ows
if is diophantine that is a q for some c b and all a q rational then t can be conjugated by a smooth map of to its ane linear part qb y ax cx
where z see
hence the disjointness of from x t for a t with a diophantine follows from theorem

however if is not diophantine the dynamics of the ow t can be very dierent from an ane linear ow
for example as furstenberg shows it may be irregular i
e
the limits in
fail to exist for certain observables
our main result is that these nonlinear skew products are linearly disjoint from at least if h satises some further technical hypothesis
firstly we assume that h is analytic namely that if then for some
secondly we assume that there is such that xmz e



this is not a very natural condition being an artifact of our proof
however it is not too restrictive and the following applies rather generally and most importantly there is no condition on
theorem

let x t be of the form
with h satisfying
and

then is linearly disjoint from x
the assertion of thereom
holds for all and so we have to consider all diophantine possibilities of
the tool is the bourgain sarnak ziegler nite version of the gradov method incorporated with various analytic methods such as poisson s summation and stationary phase
furstenberg gives examples of skew product transformations of the form
which are not regular in the sense of

many of the ows x in rem
have this property and we show in that furstenberg s examples are smoothly conjugate to such x s
in particular his examples are linearly disjoint from
theorem
deals with the ane linear distal ows on the n torus
a dierent source of homogeneous distal ows are the ane linear ows on nilmanifold x g where g is a nilpotent lie group and a lattice in g
for x t g where t x with g i
e
translation on g the linear disjointness of and x is proven in and
using the classication of zero entropy equivalently distal ane linear ows on nilmanifolds and green and tao s results we establish in the following
theorem

let x t g where t is an ane linear map of the nilmanifold g of zero entropy
then is linearly disjoint from x
the above results for can be proved in the same way for similar multiplicative functions such as n where n is the number of prime factors of n

disjointness of from furstenberg s systems as a consequence of theorem
it is proved in that is linearly disjoint from furstenberg s systems
but no rate of convergence is obtained there since theorem
in general oers no rate
in this section we show that for furstenberg s systems rate of convergence is actually available if we work on these systems directly rather than appeal to theorem



the continued fraction expansion of
we assume that is irrational and our argument will depend on the continued fraction expansion of
every real number has its continued fraction representation where is the integral part of and


are positive integers
the expression
is innite since q
we write


for the expression on the right hand side of
which is the limit of the nite continued expressions as k
writing


ak lk qk


we have and for lk qk
since is irrational we have qk for all k
an induction argument gives the stronger assertion that qk for all and thus qk increases at least like an exponential function of k
the irrationality of also implies that for all

furstenberg s examples
furstenberg gave examples of smooth transformation t such that the ergodic averages do not all exist
let be as above such that for all positive k
dene qk and set
lk eqk





it follows from
and
that is a smooth function
we also have where so that and in particular denes and measurable function
but can not correspond to a continuous function as shown in furstenberg


disjointness of from furstenberg s systems
in the following we consider slightly more general h s with where satises
and for all positive k the coecients ck satisfy ck c for some positive constant c which we may assume to be greater than
we note that if ck is not bounded then will not be
now what we want to estimate is essentially



xnn and our result is the following
proposition

let be as in

then n loga n
where the implied constant depends on a but is independent of
proof
by
we have
we should cut the last sum at some point
let k be such that log n
then for k k we have eqk
so that c neqk cneqk cn where we the implied constant does not depend on c
it follows that o xnn c
n the o term as well as ck above are harmless and so from now on we concentrate on e xnn xnn on writing k kqkk
note that by
we have k eqk
we have a sequence


and therefore qk exp with k repeated exp s
taking k k and noting that give exp exp log n
where on the left hand side there are k exp s
now let
then is a smooth periodic function and hence can expanded into fourier series xlz where

z


we must compute the dependence of on
by partial integration for we have z l z z
c c
for all
the above is absolute
of course the above can be improved to la for arbitrary a but we are not going to use this
the sum in
is of the form e f n xnn xnn xlz n xlz f n xnn since we have and consequently e where f n stands for the remaining terms in the e in

it follows from this and
that e f n xlz c xlz c sup xnn f n xnn f n

xnn sup


xnn repeating this procedure in
we get c


e the inner sum involving can be estimated by classical results of davenport and hua as n loga n where a is arbitrary and the implied constant depends at most on a i
e
it does not depend on the coecients


or



by
we have c log n
the proposition is proved
