in automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey santosh kumar korra sathya and sanjay kumar abstract in recent times data is growing rapidly in every domain such as news social media banking education
due to the excessiveness of data there is a need of automatic summarizer which will be capable to summarize the data especially textual data in original document without losing any critical purposes
text summarization is emerged as an important research area in recent past
in this regard review of existing work on text summarization process is useful for carrying out further research
in this paper recent literature on automatic keyword extraction and text summarization are presented since text summarization process is highly depend on keyword extraction
this literature includes the discussion about different methodology used for keyword extraction and text summarization
it also discusses about different databases used for text summarization in several domains along with evaluation matrices
finally it discusses briefly about issues and research challenges faced by researchers along with future direction
keywords abstractive summary extractive summary keyword extraction natural language processing text summarization

introduction in the era of internet plethora of online information are freely available for readers in the form of e newspapers journal articles technical reports transcription dialogues
there are huge number of documents available in above digital media and extracting only relevant information from all these media is a tedious job for the individuals in stipulated time
there is a need for an automated system that can extract only relevant information from these data sources
to achieve this one need to mine the text from the documents
text mining is the process of extracting large quantities of text to derive high quality information
text mining deploys some of the techniques of natural language processing nlp such as parts of speech parsing n grams tokenization
to perform the text analysis
it includes tasks text summarization
automatic keyword extraction tagging pos like and automatic keyword extraction is the process of selecting words and phrases from the text document that can at best project the core sentiment of the document without any human intervention depending on the model
the target of automatic keyword extraction is the application of the power and speed of current computation abilities to the problem of access and recovery stressing upon information organization without the added costs of human annotators
summarization is a process where the most salient features of a text are extracted and compiled into a short abstract of the original document
according to mani and maybury text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a text to produce an abridged version for a particular task and user
summaries are usually around of the original text and yet contain everything that could have been learned from reading the original article
in the wake of big data analysis summarization is an efficient and powerful technique to give a glimpse of the whole data
the text summarization can be achieved in two ways namely abstractive summary and extractive summary
the abstractive summary is a topic under tremendous research however no standard algorithm has been achieved yet
these summaries are derived from learning what was expressed in the article and then converting it into a form expressed by the computer
it resembles how a human would summarize an article after reading it
whereas extractive summary extract details from the original article itself and present it to the reader
automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey text figure classification of automatic keyword extraction on the basis of approaches used in existing literature is techniques includes all the primary phase of in this paper reviewed the recent literature on automatic keyword extraction and text summarization
the valuable keywords extraction summarization
therefore in this literature we focused on both the techniques
in keyword extraction the literature discussed about different methodologies used for keyword extraction process and what algorithms used under each methodology as shown in figure
it also discussed about different domains in which keyword extraction algorithms applied
similarly in the process of text summarization literature covers all the possible process of text summarization such as document types single or multi summary types supervised or generic or query based unsupervised characteristics of summary abstractive or extractive
further the possible it methodologies for text summarization as shown in figure
this literature also discusses about different databases used for text summarization such as duc tac medline
along with differnt evaluation matrices such as precision recall and rouge series
finally it discusses briefly about issues and research challenges faced by researchers followed by future direction of text summarization
the rest of this paper is organized as follows
section presents a review on automatic keyword extraction section presents a review on text summarization process
a review on automatic text summarization methologies are given in section
the details about different databases are described in section
section explains about evaluation matrices for text summarization
finally the conclusion with future direction is drawn in section
automatic keyword extraction a review on the premise of past work done towards automatic keyword extraction from the text for its summarization extraction systems can be classified into four classes namely simple statistical approach linguistics approach machine learning approach and hybrid approaches as soon in figure

simple statistical approach these strategies are rough simplistic and have a tendency to have no training sets
they concentrate on statistics got from non linguistic features of the document for example the position of a word inside the document the term frequency and inverse document frequency
these insights are later used to build up a list of keywords
cohen utilized n gram statistical data to discover the keyword inside the document automatically
other techniques side this class incorporate word frequency term frequency tf or term inverse document frequency tf idf word occurrences and pat tree
the most essential of them is term frequency
in these strategies the frequency of occurrence is the main criteria that choose whether a word is a keyword or not
it is extremely unrefined and tends to give very unseemly results
an improvement of this strategy is the tf idf which also takes the frequency of occurrence of a word as the model to choose a keyword or not
similarly word co occurrence methods manage statistical information about the number of times a word has happened and the number of times it has happened with another word
this statistical information is then used to compute support and confidence of the words
apriori technique is then used to infer the keywords

linguistics approach this approach utilizes the linguistic features of the words for keyword detection and extraction in text documents
it incorporates the lexical analysis syntactic analysis discourse analysis
the resources used for lexical analysis are an electronic dictionary tree tagger wordnet grams pos pattern
similarly noun phrase np chunks parsing are used as resources for syntactic analysis

machine learning approach keyword extraction can also be seen as a learning problem
this approach requires manually annotated training data and automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey table previous studies on automatic keyword extraction study types of approach domain types dennis et al

table types of approach and domains used in keyword extraction types of approach simple statistics ss linguistics l machine learning ml hybrid h types of domain radio news rn journal articles ja newspaper articles na technical reports tr transcription dialogues td encyclopedia article ea web pages wp training models
hidden markov model support vector machine svm naive bayes nb bagging
are commonly used training models in these approaches
in the second phase the document whose keywords are to be extracted is given as inputs to the model which then extracts the keywords that best fit the model s training
one of the most famous algorithms in this approach is the keyword extraction algorithm kea
in this approach the article is first converted into a graph where each word is treated as a node and whenever two words appear in the same sentence the nodes are connected with an edge for each time they appear together
then the number of edges connecting the vertices are converted into scores and are clustered accordingly
the cluster heads are treated as keywords
bayesian algorithms use the bayes classifier to classify the word into two categories keyword or not a keyword depending on how it is trained
genex is another tool in this approach

hybrid approach these approaches combine the above two methods or use heuristics such as position length layout feature of the automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey words html tags around the words

these algorithms are designed to take the best features from above mentioned approaches
based on the classification shown in figure we bring a consolidated summary of previous studies on automatic keyword extraction and is shown in table
it discusses the approaches that are used for keyword extraction and various domains of dataset in which experiments are performed as shown in table

text summarization process a review based on the literature text summarization process can be characterized into five types namely based on the number of the document based on summary usage based on techniques based on characteristics of summary as text and based on levels of linguistics process as shown in figure

single document text summarization in single document text summarization it takes a single document as an input to perform summarization and produce a single output document
thomas et al
designed a system for automatic keyword extraction for text in single document e newspaper article
summarization marcu al
developed a discourse based summarizer that determines adequacy for summarizing texts for based methods in the domain of single news articles

multiple document text summarization in multiple documents text summarization it takes numerous documents as an input to perform summarization and deliver a single output document
mirroshandel al
presents two different algorithms towards temporal relation based keyword extraction and text summarization in multi document
the first algorithm was a weakly for classification of temporal relations between events and the supervised machine approach learning learning approach second algorithm was expectation maximization em based unsupervised relation extraction
min al
used the information which is common to document sets belonging to a common category to improve the quality of automatically extracted content in multi document summaries
temporal for the
query based text summarization in this summarization technique a particular portion is utilized to extract the essential keyword from input document summary of corresponding document to make
fisher et al
developed a based summarization system that uses a log linear model to classify each word in a sentence
it exploits the property of sentence ranking methods in which they consider neural query ranking and query focused ranking
dong al
developed a query based summarization that uses document ranking time sensitive queries and ranks recency sensitive queries as the features for text summarization

extractive text summarization in this procedure summarizer discovers more critical information either words or sentences from input document to make the summary of the corresponding document
in this process it uses statistical and linguistic features of the sentences to decide the most relevant sentences in the given input document
thomas al
designed a hybrid model based extractive summarizer using machine learning and simple statistical method for keyword extraction from e newspaper article
min al
used freely available open source to extractive summarize the text in multi document
they used information which is common to document sets belonging to a common category as a feature and encapsulated the concept of category specific importance csi
they showed that csi is a valuable metric to aid sentence selection in extractive called swing summarization system figure characterization of the text summarization process automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey summarization tasks
marcu et al
developed a based extractive summarizer that uses the rhetorical parsing algorithm to determine discourse structure of the text of given input determine partial ordering on the elementary and parenthetical units of the text
erkan et al
developed an extractive summarization environment
it consists of three steps feature extractor the feature vector and reranker
features are centroid position length cutoff simwithfirst lexpagerank and queryphrasematch
alguliev al
learning based extractive developed an unsupervised summarizer relevance redundancy and length
it split documents into sentences and select salient sentences from the document
aramaki al
destined a supervised learning based extractive text summarizer that identifies the negative event and it also investigates what kind of information is helpful for negative event identification
an svm classifier is used to distinguish negative events from other events
three properties that optimizes sentences

abstractive text summarization in this procedure a machine needs to comprehend the idea of all the input documents and then deliver summary with its it uses particular linguistic methods to examine and interpret the text and then to find the new concepts and expressions to best describe it by generating a new shorter text that conveys the most important information from the original text document
brandow al
developed an abstractive summarization system that analyses the statistical corpus and extracts the signature words from the
then it assigns the weight for all the signature words
based on the extracted signature words they assign the weight to the sentences and select few top weighted sentences as the summary
daume al
developed an abstractive summarization system that maps all the documents into database like representation
further it classifies into four categories a single person single event multiple event and natural disaster
it generates a short headline using a set of predefined templates
it generates summaries by extracting sentences from the database

supervised learning based text summarization this type of learning techniques used labeled dataset for training
thomas al
designed a system for automatic keyword extraction for text summarization using hidden markov model
the learning process was supervised it used human annotated keyword set to train the model
mirroshandel al
used a set of labeled dataset to train the system for the classification of temporal relations between events
aramaki al
learning based extractive destined a supervised text summarizer that identifies the negative event and also investigates what kind of information is helpful for negative event identification
an svm classifier is used to distinguish negative events from other events

unsupervised learning based text summarization in this technique there are no predefined guidelines available at the time of training
mirroshandel et al
proposed a method for temporal relation extraction based on the expectation maximization em algorithm
within em they used different techniques such as a greedy best first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal
the em based approach was a fully unsupervised temporal relation based extraction for text an summarization
alguliev unsupervised that optimizes three properties relevance redundancy and length
it split documents into sentences and select salient sentences from the document
developed learning based extractive summarizer et al

text summarization approach a review based on the literature text summarization approaches can be classified into five types namely statistical based machine learning based coherent based graph based algebraic based as shown in figure
the documents
there
statistical based approach this approach is very simple and crude often used for keyword extraction from is no predefined dataset required for this approach
to extract the keywords from documents it uses several statistical features of the document such as term or word frequency tf term frequency inverse document frequency tf idf position of keyword pok
as mentioned in figures and
these statistical summarization
features are used text for
machine learning based approach machine learning is a feature dependent approach we one need annotated dataset to trained the models
there are several popular machine learning approaches namely nave bayes nb decision trees dts hidden markov model hmm maximum entropy me neural network nn svm
used for text summarization
support vector machine automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey table list of abbreviations used in classification of text summarization approaches list of abbreviations tf term frequency if idf term frequency inverse document frequency figure classification of text summarization approaches pok hmm position of a keyword hidden markov model dt me nn nb decision trees maximum entropy neural networks nave bayes dlcss direct lexical chain span score dlcs lcss direct lexical chain score lexical chain span score lcs lexical chain score rhetorical structure theory lexical chain gpr google s pagerank rst lc hits mlsa snmf slss lsa nmf svd sdd hyperlinked induced topic search meta latent semantic analysis symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization sentence level semantic analysis latent semantic analysis non negative matrix factorization singular value decomposition semi discrete decomposition
coherent based approach a coherent based approach basically deals with the cohesion the words
cohesion relations among relations among elements substitution text in a conjunction and lexical cohesion
lexical chain lc reference ellipsis wordnet wn lexical chain score of a word lcs direct lexical chain score of a word dlcs lexical chain span score of a word lcss direct lexical chain span score of a word dlcss rhetorical structure theory rst

graph based approach there are two popular graph based approaches used for text summarization namely hyperlinked induced topic search gpr hits
and google s pagerank such as latent semantic analysis
algebraic approach in this approach one use algebraic theories namely matrix transpose of matrix eigen vectors
there are many algorithms used for text summarization using algebraic approach lsa meta latent semantic analysis mlsa symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization snmf sentence level semantic analysis slss non negative matrix factorization nmf singular value decomposition svd semi discrete decomposition sdd

databases a review in the literature we observed that there are seven types of databases used for text summarization process namely document understanding workshop duc medline text analysis conference tac computational linguistics scientific document summarization shared task corpus cl scisumm tipster text summarization evaluation conference summac topic detection and tracking tdt
the duc international conference for performance evaluation in the area of text summarization
this dataset is composed of topics and documents the is automatic keyword extraction for text summarization a survey identifiers and to with

article relevant to each topic from the aquaint corpus for relevant multi document summarization
pubmed dataset is a baseline repository that links million identifiers and articles
with it journal contains abstracts from more than journals
medline also provides keyword searches and returns abstracts that contain the keywords
the tac is the international conference for performance evaluation in the area of subparts of natural language processing such as text summarization
usually and conference dataset used for text summarization in past
the cl scisumm shared task is run off the cl scisumm corpus and comprises three sub tasks in automatic research paper summarization on a new corpus of research papers
a training of twenty topics and a test of ten topics were released
the topics comprised of acl computational linguistics research papers and their citing papers and three output summaries each
the three output summaries comprise the traditional self summary of the paper the abstract the community summary the collection of citation sentences citances and a human summary written by a trained annotator
tipster is a corpus of documents from the computation and language cmp lg collection has been marked up in xml and made available as a general resource to the information retrieval extraction and summarization communities


performance evaluation measure a review in the field of text summarization performance evaluation measure can be classified into two categories namely intrinsic and extrinsic
the intrinsic evaluation judges the quality of the summary directly based on analysis in terms of some set of norms whereas extrinsic evaluation judges the quality of the summary based on the how it affects the completion of some other task
the complete structure of classification about evaluation measure for text summarization is given in figure
to compare the performances one used the rouge evaluation software package which compares various summary results from several summarization methods with summaries generated by humans
rouge has been applied by the document understanding conference duc for performance evaluation
rouge includes five automatic evaluation methods rougen rouge l rouge w rouge s and rouge su
each method estimates recall precision and measure between experts reference summaries and candidate summaries of the proposed system
rouge n uses the n gram recall between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries

it discusses the approaches that are used for text summarization experiment performed using single or multiple documents types of summary usage characteristics of the summary and metrics used
the details of the parameters are given in table

issues and challenges occurs in text summarization in the area of text summarization there are following research issues and challenges occurs during implementation

research issues in the case of multi document text summarization several issues occurs frequently while evaluation of summary such as redundancy temporal dimension co reference or sentence ordering
which makes very difficult to achieve quality summary
some other issues occurs such as grammaticality cohesion coherence which is harmful for summary
the quality of summaries are varying from system to system or person to person
some person feels some set of sentences are important for summary at the same time other person feel the other set of sentences are important for required summary

implementation challenges to get the quality summary quality keywords are required for text summarization
there is no standard to identify quality keywords within or multiple documents
the extracted for applying different keywords are varying approaches of keyword extraction
multi lingual text summarisation is another challenging task

conclusion and future direction in time
information text summarization is very helpful for users to extract only this area in stipulated needed considerable amount of work has been done in the recent past
due to lack of information and standardization lot of research overlap is a common phenomenon
since exhaustive is not published on automatic keyword review paper extraction and in indian text summarization especially context
therefore we thought that the survey paper covering recent work in keyword extraction and text summarization may ignite the research community for filling some important research gaps
this paper contains the literature review of recent work in text summarization from the point of views of automatic keyword extraction text databases summarization process summarization methodologies and evaluation matrices
some important research issues in the area of text summarization are also highlighted in the paper
in future one can target following direction in the field of summarization text summarization languages especially in indian language context such as telugu hindi tamil bengali
low resourced in this work can also be extended to multi lingual text summarization
multimedia summarization
