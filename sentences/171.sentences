traditionally summarization algorithms have been evaluated only based on how well they match human written summaries e

as sured by rouge scores
in this work we propose to evaluate summarization algorithms from a completely new perspective that is important when the user generated data to be summarized comes from dierent cially salient user groups e

men or women caucasians or african americans or dierent political groups republicans or democrats
in such cases we check whether the generated summaries fairly represent these dierent social groups
specically considering that an extractive summarization algorithm selects a set of the textual units e

microblogs in the original data for inclusion in the summary we investigate whether this selection is fair or not
our experiments over real world microblog datasets show that existing summarization algorithms often represent the socially salient user groups very dierently compared to their distributions in the original data
more importantly some groups are frequently under represented in the erated summaries and hence get far less exposure than what they would have obtained in the original data
to reduce such adverse impacts we propose novel fairness preserving summarization algorithms which duce high quality summaries while ensuring fairness among various groups
to our knowledge this is the rst attempt to produce fair text summarization and is likely to open up an interesting research direction

com present relevant points and topics from a piece of text
multiple phone apps e

inshorts have also been launched to provide short summaries of news stories
a large number of text summarization algorithms have been devised including algorithms to summarize a single large document as well as for summarizing a set of documents e

a set of microblogs or tweets interested readers can check for a survey on summarization algorithms
most of these summarization algorithms are extractive in nature i
e
they form the summary by extracting some of the textual units in the input e

individual sentences in a document or individual tweets in a set of tweets
additionally some abstractive algorithms have also been devised that attempt to generate natural language summaries
in this paper we restrict our focus to the more prevalent extractive summarization
extractive summarization algorithms essentially perform a selection of a small subset of the textual units in the input for inclusion in the summary based on some measure of the relative quality or importance of the textual units
traditionally these algorithms are judged based on how closely the algorithmic summary matches gold standard summaries that are usually written by human annotators
to this end measures such as rouge scores are used to evaluate the ness of algorithmic summaries
the underlying assumption behind this traditional evaluation criteria is that the data to be summarized is homogeneous and the sole focus of summarization rithms should be to identify summary worthy information
however user generated content constitutes a large chunk of information generated on the web today and such content is often heterogeneous coming from users belonging to dierent social groups
for example on social media dierent user groups e

men and women republicans and democrats discuss socio political issues and it has been observed that dierent social groups often express very dierent opinions on the same topic or event
hence while summarizing such heterogeneous user generated data one needs to check whether the summaries are properly representing the opinions of these dierent social groups
since the textual units e

tweets that are included in the summary get much more exposure than the rest of the information similar to how top ranked search results get much more exposure than other documents if a particular group is under represented in the summary their opinion will get much less exposure than the opinion of other groups
therefore in this paper we propose to look at summarization algorithms from a completely new perspective and investigate whether the selection of the textual units in the summary is fair i
e
whether the generated summary fairly represents every social group in the input data
we experiment with three datasets of tweets generated by dierent user groups men and women pro republican and pro democratic users
we nd that most existing summarization algorithms do not fairly represent dierent groups in the generated summaries even though the tweets ten by these groups are of comparable textual quality
more worryingly some groups are found to be systemically under represented in the process
note that we by no means claim such representation to be intentionally caused by the existing algorithms
rather it is most likely an inadvertent perpetuation of the metrics that the algorithms are trying to optimize
since the plications of summarization algorithms may extend from product reviews to citizen journalism the question of whether existing algorithms are fair and how we can potentially improve them become even more important
having observed that existing summarization algorithms do not give fair summaries in most cases we next attempt to develop algorithms for fair summarization
recently there have been tiple research works attempting to incorporate fairness in machine learning algorithms
primarily there are three ways in which these research works make fairness interventions in an existing system pre processing in processing and post processing depending on whether the terventions are applied at the input algorithm or the output stage
following this line of work in this paper we develop three novel fairness preserving summarization algorithms which select highly relevant textual units in the summary while maintaining fairness in the process
our proposed in processing algorithm is based on constrained sub modular optimization where the fairness criteria are applied as constraints
the post processing algorithm is based on fair ing of textual units based on some goodness measure and the pre processing approach groups the tweets on the basis of their association to dierent classes and then summarizes each group separately to generate fair summaries
extensive evaluations show that our proposed algorithms are able to generate summaries having quality comparable to state of the art summarization rithms which often do not generate fair summaries while being fair to dierent user groups
in summary we make the following contributions in this paper ours is one of the rst tempts to consider the notion of fairness in summarization and the rst work on fair tion of textual information we show that while summarizing content generated by dierent user groups existing summarization algorithms often do not represent the user groups fairly and we propose summarization algorithms that produce summaries that are of good quality as well as fair according to dierent fairness notions including equal representation proportional sentation and so on
we have made the implementation of our fair summarization algorithms and our datasets publicly available at
com fairsumm
we believe that this work will be an important addition to the growing literature on ing fairness in algorithmic systems
generation of fair summaries would not only benet the end users of the summaries but also many downstream applications that use the summaries of sourced information e

summary based opinion classication and rating inference systems
the rest of the paper is structured as follows
section gives a background on summarization and discusses related works
section describes the datasets we use throughout the paper
after we motivate the need for fair summarization in section
section introduces some possible notions of fairness in summarization and section shows how existing text summarization rithms do not adhere to these fairness notions
in section we discuss a principled framework for achieving fairness in summarization followed by details of three fair summarization algorithms in sections and
we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms in section
finally we conclude the paper discussing some limitations of the proposed algorithms and possible future directions
background and related work in this section we discuss two strands of prior works that are relevant to our paper
first we focus on text summarization
then we relate this paper to prior works on bias and fairness in information systems

text summarization text summarization is a well studied problem in natural language processing where the task is to produce a uent and informative summary given a piece of text or a collection of text ments
a large number of text summarization algorithms have been proposed in literature the reader can refer to for surveys
as discussed in the introduction there are two variants of summarization algorithms extractive and abstractive summarization algorithms
while most classical summarization algorithms were unsupervised the recent years have seen the ation of many supervised neural network based models for summarization the reader can refer to for a survey on neural summarization models
to contextualise our work next we discuss dierent types of extractive text summarization algorithms in the literature
single document summarization traditional single document extractive summarization deals with extraction of useful information from a single document
a series of single document rization algorithms have been proposed
we will describe some of these algorithms in section
one of the most commonly used class of summarization algorithms is tered around the popular tf idf model
dierent works have used tf idf based similarities for summarization
additionally there has been a series of works where summarization has been treated as a sub modular optimization problem
one of the fair summarization rithms proposed in this work is also based on a sub modular constrained optimization framework and uses the notion of tf idf similarity
multi document summarization multi document extractive summarization deals with tion of information from multiple documents pieces of text written about the same topic
for instance neats is a multi document summarization system that given a collection of paper articles as input generates a summary in three stages content selection ltering and presentation
hub authority is another multi document summarization system which uses the markov model to order the sub topics that the nal summary should contain and then puts the summary according to the sentence ranking score of all sentences within one sub topic
generic relation extraction gre is another multi document text summarization approach which aims to build systems for relation identication and characterization that can be ferred across domains and tasks without modication of model parameters
celikyilmaz et al
described multi document summarization as a prediction problem based on a two phase hybrid model and proposed a hierarchical topic model to discover the topic structures of all sentences
wong et al
proposed a semi supervised method for extractive summarization by co training two classiers iteratively
in each iteration the unlabeled training sentences with top scores are included in the labeled training set and the classiers are trained on the new training data
summarization of user generated text on social media with the proliferation of user erated textual content on social media e

twitter facebook a number of summarization rithms have been developed specically for such content
for instance carenini et al
posed a novel summarization algorithm that summarizes e mail conversations using fragment quotation graph and clue words
nichols et al
described an algorithm that generates a nalistic summary of an event using only status updates from twitter as information source
they used temporal cues to nd important moments within an event and a sentence ranking method to extract the most relevant sentences describing the event
rudra et al
proposed a rization algorithm for tweets posted during disaster events
kim et al
used narrative theory as a framework for identifying the links between social media content and designed ing tasks to generate summaries of events based on commonly used narrative templates
zhang et al
proposed a recursive summarization workow where they design a summary tree that enables readers to digest the entire abundance of posts
zhang et al
developed tilda which allows participants of a discussion to collectively tag group link and summarize chat messages in a variety of ways such as by adding emoji reactions to messages or leaving written notes

bias and fairness in information filtering algorithms bias in applications on user generated content powerful computational resources along with the enormous amount of data from social media sites has driven a growing school of works that uses a combination of machine learning natural language processing statistics and network ence for decision making
in baeza yates has discussed how human perceptions and societal biases creep into social media and how dierent algorithms fortify them
these observations raise questions of bias in the decisions derived from such analyses
friedman et al
broadly rized these biases into dierent classes and essentially were the rst to propose a framework for comprehensive understanding of the biases
several recent works have investigated dierent types of biases demographic ranking position biases
and their eects on online social dia
our observations in this work show that summaries generated by existing rithms which do not consider fairness can lead to biases towards against socially salient graphic groups
rooney rule the notion of implicit bias has been an important component in understanding crimination in activities such as hiring promotion and school admissions
research on implicit bias hypothesizes that when people evaluate others e

while hiring for a job their scious biases about membership in particular groups can have an eect on their decision making even when they have no deliberate intention to discriminate against members of these groups
to this end the rooney rule was proposed hoping to reduce the adverse eects of such implicit biases
the rooney rule is a national football league policy in the usa that requires league teams to interview ethnic minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operation jobs
roughly speaking it requires that while recruiting for a job opening one of the candidates interviewed must come from an underrepresented group
as per there are two variants of the rooney rule
the soft armative action programs encompass outreach attempts like ity recruitment and counseling
while the hard armative action programs usually include explicit preferences or quotas that reserve a specic number of openings exclusively for members of the preferred group
in the context of summarization any summarization algorithm will adhere to the soft variant of rooney rule since all the textual units be it from majority or minority groups have candidature to enter the summary
however existing summarization algorithms are not guaranteed to adhere to the hard variant of the rooney rule
the algorithms proposed in this paper detailed in sections and are guaranteed to also cohere to the hard variant of the rooney rule since they maintain a specic level of representation of various social groups in the nal summary
fairness in information ltering algorithms given that information ltering algorithms search recommendation summarization algorithms have far reaching social and economic consequences in today s world fairness and anti discrimination have been recent inclusions in the algorithm sign perspective
there have been several recent works on dening and achieving dierent notions of fairness as well as on removing the existing unfairness from dierent methodologies
dierent fairness aware algorithms have been proposed to achieve group individual fairness for tasks such as clustering classication ing matching recommendation and sampling
to our knowledge only two prior works have looked into fairness in summarization
celis et al
proposed a methodology to obtain fair and diverse summaries
they applied their tal point process based algorithm on an image dataset and a categorical dataset having several attributes and not on textual data
the problem of fair text summarization was rst introduced in our prior work which showed that many existing text summarization algorithms do not generate fair summaries however no algorithm for fair summarization was proposed in
to our knowledge ours is the rst work to propose algorithms for fair summarization of textual data
datasets used since our focus in this paper is to understand the need for fairness while summarizing generated content we consider datasets containing tweets posted by dierent groups of users e

dierent gender groups or groups of users with dierent political leanings
specically we use the following three datasets throughout this paper
claritin dataset patients undergoing medication often post the consequences of using ferent drugs on social media especially highlighting the side eects they endure
claritin loratadine is an anti allergic drug that reduces the eects of natural chemical histamine in the body which can produce symptoms of sneezing itching watery eyes and runny nose
however this drug may also have some adverse eects on the patients
to understand the sentiments of people towards claritin and dierent side eects caused by it tweets posted by users about claritin were collected analyzed and later publicly released by figure eight erstwhile crowdflower
this dataset contains tweets in english about the eects of the drug
each tweet is annotated with the gender of the user male female unknown posting it
initial analyses on these tweets reveal that women mentioned some serious side eects of the drug e

heart palpitations shortness of breathe headaches while men did not
from this dataset we ignored those tweets for which the gender of the user is unknown
we also removed exact duplicate tweets since they do not have any meaningful role in summarization
finally we have tweets in total of which
are written by men and
by women
us election dataset this dataset consists of tweets related to the us presidential tion collected by the website tweetelect
com work tweetelect during the period from september to november the election day
tweetelect used an initial set of keywords related to the election including all candidate names and common hashtags about the participating parties for ltering relevant tweets
subsequently state of the art adaptive tering methods were used to expand the set of keywords with additional terms that emerged over time and their related tweets were added to the collection
in this dataset released by darwish et al
each tweet is annotated as supporting or attacking one of the presidential candidates donald trump and hillary clinton or neutral or attacking both
for simplicity we grouped the tweets into three classes pro republican tweets which support trump and or attack clinton pro democratic tweets which support clinton and or attack trump and neutral tweets which are neutral or attack both candidates
after removing duplicates we have tweets out of which
are pro republican
tweets are pro democratic and remaining
are neutral tweets
metoo dataset we collected a set of tweets related to the metoo movement in october
we initially collected english tweets containing the hashtag metoo using the twitter search api
after removing duplicates we were left with distinct tweets
we asked three human annotators to examine the name and bio of the twitter accounts who posted the tweets
the annotators observed three classes of tweets based on who posted the tweets tweets posted by male users tweets posted by female users and tweets posted by organizations mainly news media agencies
also there were many tweets for which the annotators could not understand the type gender of the user posting the tweet
for purpose of this study we decided to focus only on those tweets for which all the annotators were certain that they were written by men or women
in total we had such tweets out of which are written by men and are written by women
in summary two of our datasets contain tweets posted by two social groups men and women which the other dataset contains three categories of tweets pro democratic pro republican and neutral tweets presumably written by users having the corresponding political leanings
human generated summaries for evaluation the traditional way of evaluating the ness of a summary is to match it with one or more human generated summaries gold standard and then compute rouge scores
rouge scores are between where a higher rouge score means a better algorithmic summary that has higher levels of similarity with the gold dard summaries
specically the similarity is computed in terms of common unigrams in case of or common bigrams in case of between the algorithmic summary and the human generated summaries
for creating the gold standard summaries we asked three human annotators to summarize the datasets
each annotator is well versed with the use of social media like twitter is uent in english and none is an author of this paper
the annotators were asked to generate extractive summaries independently i
e
without consulting one another
we use these three human generated summaries for the evaluation of algorithmically generated summaries by computing the average and recall and scores
why do we need fair summaries traditionally summarization algorithms have only considered including in the summary those textual units tweets in our case whose contents are most summary worthy
in contrast in this paper we argue for giving a fair chance to textual units written by dierent social groups to appear in the summary
before making this argument two questions need to be investigated are the tweets written by dierent social groups of comparable textual quality if not someone may argue for discarding lower quality tweets generated by a specic user group
do the tweets written by dierent social groups actually reect dierent opinions this tion is important since if the opinions of the dierent groups are not dierent then it can be argued that selecting tweets of any group for inclusion in the summary is sucient
we attempt to answer these two questions in this section

are tweets written by dierent social groups of comparable quality we use three measures for estimating the textual quality of individual tweets
first the nava words nouns adjectives verbs adverbs are known to be the most informative words in an english text
hence we consider the count of nava words in a tweet as a measure of its textual quality
we consider two other measures of textual quality that are specic to the application of text summarization ii precision and iii precision scores
put simply the precision score of a tweet measures what fraction of the unigrams bigrams in the tweet appears in the gold standard summaries for the corresponding dataset as described in section
thus these scores specically measure the utility of selecting a particular tweet for inclusion in the summary
for a particular dataset we compare the distributions of the three scores precision score precision score and count of nava words for the subsets of tweets written by dierent user groups
for all cases we found that precision scores and sion scores show similar trends hence we report only the precision scores
figure and figure respectively compare the distributions of precision scores and nava word counts among the tweets written by male and female users in the metoo dataset
we nd that the distributions are very close to each other thus implying that the tweets written by both groups are of comparable textual quality
similarly figure shows that in the us election dataset the pro democratic pro republican and neutral tweets are of comparable textual quality
the tual quality of the tweets written by male and female users in the claritin dataset are also very similar the mean number of nava words are
and
respectively for tweets written by male and female users while the mean precision scores are

timesup metoo a long term solution would be the exact opposite of the two suggested here gender sensitisation not segregation so that exchange between dierent genders is normalised instead of being stigmatised further
metoo table
example tweets containing the hashtags that are most frequently posted by male and male users in the metoo dataset
even though all tweets have high textual quality the opinions expressed by the two groups of users are quite diverse
female detailed results omitted for brevity
all these values show that the textual quality is very similar for the dierent groups of tweets across all the three datasets

do tweets written by dierent user groups reflect dierent opinion to answer this question we asked our human annotators those who prepared the gold standard summaries to observe the tweets written by dierent user groups in the datasets
for all three datasets the annotators observed that the tweets posted by dierent social groups mostly contain very dierent information opinion
for instance table shows some sample tweets written by male and female users in the metoo dataset along with some of the hashtags that are frequently posted by male and female users highlighted
we observe that most tweets written by women support the metoo movement and give examples of relevant experiences of themselves or of other women
on the other hand many of the tweets written by male users point out undesirable side eects of the movement and call for gender equality
similarly in the us election dataset the pro republican tweets criticize hillary clinton support the policies of donald trump e

we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval oce
draintheswamp while the pro democratic tweets have the site opinion e

yes america
this is the election where hillary s cough gets more furious coverage than trump asking people to shoot her interrogatetrump
the neutral tweets either give only formation and no opinion or criticize both clinton and trump
for the claritin dataset as well there is large dierence in opinion among the tweets written by male and female users the male users criticize the drug much more than the male users details omitted for brevity
thus it is clear that tweets posted by dierent social groups often reect very dierent opinions

need for fairness in summarization the fact that tweets written by dierent social groups are of very similar quality merit implies that all groups should have equality of opportunity for their opinions to be reected in the summary
this fact coupled with the diversity in opinion of the dierent groups calls for a fair representation of the opinions of dierent groups in the summary
this is similar in spirit to the need for fairness in top crowdsourced recommendations or top search results
since the tweets that get included in the summary are likely to get much more exposure than the rest of the information just like how top search and recommendation results get much more exposure under representation of any of the social groups in the summary can severely suppress their opinion
these factors advocate the need for fair summaries when data generated by various social groups is being summarized
notions of fair summarization having established the need for fair summarization we now dene two fairness notions that are applicable in the context of summarization
essentially when the input data e

tweets are erated by users belonging to dierent social groups we require the summaries to fairly represent these groups
next we consider two notions for fairness in representation

equal representation the notion of equality nds its roots in the eld of morality and justice which advocates for the redress of undeserved inequalities e

inequalities of birth or due to natural endowment
formal equality suggests that when two people or two groups of people have equal status in at least one normatively relevant aspect they must be treated equally
in terms of selection equal representation requires that the number of representatives from dierent classes in the society having comparable relevance has to be equal
in the context of user generated content we observed that dierent sections of the society have dierent opinion on the same topic either because of their gender or ideological leaning
ever if we consider the textual quality i
e
their candidature for inclusion in the summary then tweets from both the groups are comparable as discussed in section
thus the notion of equal representation requires that a summarization algorithm will be fair if dierent groups generating the input data are represented equally in the output summary
given the usefulness of summaries in many downstream applications this notion of fairness ensures equal exposure to the opinions of dierent socially salient groups

proportional representation often it may not be possible to equally represent dierent user groups in the summary especially if the input data contains very dierent proportions from dierent groups
hence we consider another notion of fairness proportional representation also known as statistical parity
portional representation requires that the representation of dierent groups in the selected set should be proportional to their distribution in the input data
in certain scenarios such as hiring for jobs relaxations of this notion are often used
for instance the u
s
equal employment opportunity commission uses a variant of proportional tion to determine whether a company s hiring policy is biased against has any adverse impact on a demographic group
according to this policy a particular class c is under represented in the selected set or adversely impacted if the fraction of selected people belonging to class c is less than of the fraction of selected people from the class having the highest selection rate
in the context of summarization proportional representation requires that the proportion of content from dierent user groups in the summary should be same as in the original input
a laxed notion of proportional fairness is one which would ensure no adverse impact in the generated summary
in other words no adverse impact requires that the fraction of textual units from any class that is selected for inclusion in the summary should not be less than of the fraction of selected units from the class having the highest selection rate in the summary
these notions of fairness ensure that the probability of selecting an item is independent of which user group generated it
it should be noted that we are not advocating for any particular notion of fairness to be better in the context of summarization
we also note that dierent applications may require dierent types of fairness
hence in this work we propose mechanisms that can accommodate dierent notions of fairness including the ones stated above and produce fair summaries accordingly
do existing algorithms produce fair summaries having discussed the need for fair summarization we now check whether existing algorithms generate fair summaries

summarization algorithms we consider a set of well known extractive summarization algorithms that select a subset of the textual units for inclusion in the summary
some of the methods are unsupervised the traditional methods and some are recent supervised neural models
unsupervised summarization algorithms we consider six well known summarization rithms
these algorithms generally estimate an importance score for each textual unit sentence tweet in the input and the k textual units having the highest importance scores are selected to generate a summary of length
cluster rank which clusters the textual units to form a cluster graph and uses graph algorithms e

pagerank to compute the importance of each unit
dsdr which measures the relationship between the textual units using linear tions and reconstructions and generates the summary by minimizing the reconstruction error
lexrank which creates a graph representation based on similarity of the units where edges are placed depending on the intra unit cosine similarity and then computes the importance of textual units using eigenvector centrality on this graph
lsa which constructs a terms by units matrix and estimates the importance of the tual units based on singular value decomposition on the matrix
luhn which derives a signicance factor for each textual unit based on occurrences and placements of frequent words within the unit
sumbasic which uses frequency based selection of textual units and reweights word probabilities to minimize redundancy
supervised neural summarization algorithms with the recent popularity of neural network based models the state of the art techniques for summarization have shifted to data driven vised algorithms
we have considered two recently proposed extractive neural summarization models proposed in summarunner rnn a recurrent neural network based sequence model that provides a binary label to each textual unit a label of implies that the textual unit can be part of the summary while implies otherwise
each label has an associated condence score
the summary is generated by picking textual units labeled in decreasing order of their condence score
summarunner cnn is a variant of the above model where the sentences are fed to a two layer convolutional neural network cnn architecture before using gru rnn in the third layer
for both the summarunner models the authors have made the pretrained models which are trained on the cnn daily mail news articles
we directly used the pretrained models for the summarization

verifying if the summaries are fair we applied the summarization algorithms stated above on the datasets described in section to obtain summaries of length tweets each
table shows the results of summarizing the claritin dataset while table and table show the results for the us election and metoo datasets tively
in all cases shown are the numbers of tweets of the dierent classes in the whole dataset rst row and in the summaries generated by the dierent summarization algorithms subsequent rows and the average and recall and scores of the summaries
we check whether the generated summaries are fair according to the fairness notions of equal representation proportional representation and the principle of no adverse impact which were explained in section
we nd under representation of particular groups of users in the summaries generated by many of the algorithms these cases are marked in table table and table with the symbols where equal representation is violated where proportional sentation is violated and cases where there is adverse impact
especially the minority groups are under represented in most of the cases
we repeated the experiments for summaries of lengths other than as well such as for


details omitted due to lack of space
we observed several cases where the same algorithm includes very dierent proportions of tweets of various groups while generating summaries of dierent lengths

thus there is no guarantee of fairness in the summaries generated by the existing tion algorithms one or more groups are often under represented in the summaries even though the quality of the tweets written by dierent groups are quite similar as was shown in section
achieving fairness in summarization recently there has been a urry of research activities focusing on fairness issues in algorithmic decision making systems with the main emphasis on classication algorithms
proaches proposed in these works can be broadly categorised into three types pre processing in processing and post processing based on the stage where the fairness intervention is applied
to achieve fairness pre processing approaches attempt to change the input data representation in processing approaches change the underlying algorithm itself and post processing methods change the outputs of the algorithm before they get used in downstream applications
following this line of work in this paper we develop three novel fairness preserving rization algorithms adhering to the principles of and post processing which select highly relevant textual units in the summary while maintaining fairness in the process
next we discuss the key ideas behind the proposed algorithms
each of the algorithms will be explained in detail in subsequent sections
pre processing as mentioned above pre processing approaches attempt to change the input to the algorithms to make the outcome fair
the idea originated from classication algorithms where the biases in the training data may get translated into the learned model and hence by making the training data or the input unbiased the algorithm can be made non discriminatory
in our context to ensure fair representation we propose a pre processing technique classwisesumm described in section
where we rst group tweets on the basis of their association to dierent classes
then we propose to summarize each group separately using any state of the art rithm and generate


length summaries for dierent groups where the lengths


would be determined based on the fairness objective
finally these individual summaries would be combined to generate the nal fair summary
in processing in processing methods work by changing the underlying learning algorithms and making them adhere to the fairness objectives for instance by putting additional fairness straints
our proposed algorithm fairsumm detailed in section is one such algorithm where we summarize using a constrained sub modular optimization with the fairness criteria applied as matroid constraints to an objective function ensuring goodness of the summary
post processing the third approach for bringing fairness into algorithmic systems is by ifying the outputs of an algorithm to achieve the desired results for dierent groups
intervention at the output stage becomes necessary when the summarization algorithm is already decided and there is no option to change its working
for example in our context if some organization intends to stick to its proprietary summarization algorithm then post processing on the generated maries or the ranked list of textual units becomes necessary to produce fair summaries
hence we propose refasumm reranking fairly the summarization outputs where we attempt to fairly re rank the outputs generated by existing summarization algorithms detailed in section

fairsumm in processing algorithm for fair summarization our proposed in processing algorithm named fairsumm treats summarization as a constrained optimization problem of an objective function
the objective function is designed so that ing it is likely to result in a good quality summary while the fairness requirements are applied as constraints which must be obeyed during the optimization process
some notations let v denote the set of textual units e

tweets that is to be summarized
our goal is to nd a subset s v such that k where k an integer is the desired length of the summary specied as an input
formulating summarization as an optimization problem we need an objective function for extractive summarization optimizing which is likely to lead to a good summary
following the formulation by lin et al
we consider two important aspects of an extractive text summarization algorithm viz
coverage and diversity reward described below
coverage coverage refers to amount of information covered in the summary s
clearly the mary can not contain the information in all the textual units
we consider the summary s to cover the information contained in a particular textual unit i v if either s contains i or if s contains another textual unit j v that is very similar to i
here we assume a notion of similarity j between two textual units i v and j v which can be measured in various ways
thus the coverage will be measured by a function say l whose generic form can be j i s j v thus measures the overall similarity of the textual units included in the summary s with all the textual units in the input collection v
diversity reward the purpose of this aspect is to avoid redundancy and reward diverse tion in the summary
usually it is seen that the input set of textual units can be partitioned into groups where each group contains textual units that are very similar to each other
a popular way of ensuring diversity in a summary is to partition the input set into such groups and then select a representative element from each group
specically let us consider that the set v of textual units is partitioned into k groups
let


pk comprise a partition of v
that is i pi v v is formed by the union of all pi and pi pj pi pj have no element in common for all i j
for instance the ing


pk can be achieved by clustering the set v using any clustering algorithm e

k means based on the similarity of items as measured by j
then to reduce redundancy and increase diversity in the summary including textual units from dierent partitions needs to be rewarded
let the associated function for diversity reward be noted as r
a generic formulation of r is k j i s j pi s r j j where r j is a suitable function that estimates the importance of adding the textual unit j v to the summary
the function r j is called a singleton reward function since it estimates the reward of adding the singleton element j v to the summary s
one possible way to dene this function is by measuring the average similarity of j to the other textual units in v
mathematically i v justifying the functional forms of coverage and diversity reward we now explain the nicance of the functional form of in equation and in equation
we give only an intuitive explanation here more mathematical details are given in appendix a
the functions and are designed to be monotonic non decreasing submodular tions or monotone submodular functions since such functions are easier to optimize
a tonic non decreasing function is one that does not decrease usually increases as the set over which the function is employed grows
a submodular function has the property of diminishing returns which intuitively means that as the set over which the function is employed grows the increment of the function decreases
l is monotone submodular
l is monotonic since coverage increases by the addition of a new sentence in the summary
at the same time l is submodular since the increase in l would be more when a sentence is added to a shorter summary than when it is added to a longer summary
also r is a monotone submodular function
the diversity of a summary increases considerably only for the initial growth of the set when new novel elements are added to the summary and stabilizes later on and thus prevents the incorporation of similar elements redundancy in the summary
rewards diversity since there is more benet in selecting a textual unit from a partition cluster that does not yet have any of its elements included in the summary
as soon as any one element from a cluster pi is included in the summary the other elements in pi start having diminishing gains due to the square root function in equation
combining coverage and diversity reward while constructing a summary both coverage and diversity are important
only maximizing coverage may lead to lack of diversity in the ing summary and vice versa
so we dene our objective function for summarization as follows f where are the weights given to coverage and diversity respectively
our proposed fairness preserving summarization algorithm will maximize f in keeping with some fairness constraints
note that f is monotone submodular since it is a non negative linear combination of two monotone submodular functions l and r
we have chosen f such that it is monotone submodular since there exist standard algorithms to eciently optimize such functions as explained later in the section

proposed fair summarization scheme our proposed scheme is based on the concept of matriods that are typically used to generalize the notion of liner independence in matrices
specically we utilize a special type of matroids called partition matroids
we give here a brief intuitive description of our method
more details can be found in appendix a
brief background on matroids and related topics in mathematical terms a matroid is a pair m z i dened over a nite set z called the ground set and a family of sets i called the independent sets that satises the three properties empty set i
if y i and x y then x i
if x i y i and then there exists e y x such that x e i
condition simply means that i can contain the empty set i
e
the empty set is independent
condition means that every subset of an independent set is also independent
condition means that if x is independent and there exists a larger independent set y x can be extended to a larger independent set by adding an element in y but not in x
partition matroids refer to a special type of matroids where the ground set z is partitioned into s disjoint subsets


zs for some s and i s s z and zi ci for all i


s for some given parameters


cs
thus s is a subset of z that contains at least ci items from the partition zi for all i and i is the family of all such subsets
details refer to math
mit
matroid notes
pdf consider that we have a set of control variables e

gender political leaning
each item in z has a particular value for each
also consider that zj takes tj distinct values e

the trol variable gender takes the two distinct values male and female while the control variable political leaning takes the values democrat republican and neutral
for each control variable we can partition z into tj disjoint subsets


zjtj each corresponding to a particular value of this control variable
we now dene a partition matriod mj z ij such that ij s s z and zji cj for all i


tj for some given parameters


ctj
now for a given submodular objective function a submodular optimization under the tion matriod constraints with p control variables can be designed as follows maximizes z s subject to s p i
a prior work by du et al
has established that this submodular optimization problem under the matroid constraints can be solved eciently with provable guarantees see for details
formulating the fair summarization problem in the context of the fair summarization lem the ground set is v z the set of all textual units sentences tweets which we look to summarize
the control variables are analogous to the sensitive attributes with respect to which fairness is to be ensured such as gender or political leaning
in this work we consider only one sensitive attribute for a particular dataset the gender of a user for the claritin and metoo datasets and political leaning for the us election dataset
let the corresponding control variable be z and let z take t distinct values e

t for the claritin and metoo datasets and t for the us election dataset
note that the formulation can be extended to multiple sensitive attributes control variables as well
each textual unit in v is associated with a class i
e
a particular value of the control variable z e

is posted either by a male or a female
let


zt zi v for all i be disjoint subsets of the textual units from the t classes each associated with a distinct value of z
we now dene a partition matroid m v i in which v is partitioned into disjoint subsets


zt and i s s v and zi ci


t for some given parameters


ct
in other words i will contain all the sets s containing at most textual units from zi


t
now we add the fairness constraints
outside the purview of the matroid constraints we ci the desired length of the summary s and t tain the restriction that ci s are chosen such that a desired fairness criterion is maintained in s
for instance if equal representation of all classes in the summary is desired then ci we now express our fairness constrained summarization problem as follows t for all i
maximizes v f s subject to s i
where the objective function f s is as stated in equation
given that f is a submodular tion as explained earlier in this section the algorithm proposed by du et al
is suitable to solve this constrained submodular optimization problem
an example let us illustrate the formulation of the fair summarization problem with an example
assume that we are applying the equal representation fairness notion over the metoo dataset algorithm fairsumm in processing approach for fair summarization t for t


where l armini wi d n and wl
set d maxz v f z
set wt set g for t


l l do for each z v and g z i do if f g z f g wt then set g g z end if end for end for output g as the summary and we want a summary of length k tweets
then the control variable corresponds to the sensitive attribute gender which takes t values male and female for this particular dataset
the set of tweets v will be partitioned into two disjoint subsets and which will comprise the tweets posted by male and female users respectively
to enforce equal representation fairness constraint we will set the parameters and since we want equal number of tweets from and in the summary
thus i contains all the possible sets s that contain at most tweets written by male users and tweets written by female users
each such s is a valid summary that satises the fairness constraints
solving the optimization problem in equation will give us that summary s for which f s will be maximum i
e
for which coverage and diversity reward will be the highest
algorithm for fair summarization algorithm presents the algorithm to solve this constrained submodular optimization problem based on the algorithm developed by du et al

the g put by algorithm is the solution of equation
we now briey describe the steps of algorithm
in step the maximum value of the objective function f that can be achieved for a text unit v is calculated and stored in d
the purpose of this step is to compute the maximum value of f for a single text unit and set a selection threshold to be described shortly with respect to this value
this step will help in the subsequent selection of textual units for the creation of the summary to be stored in g
wt dened in step is such a threshold at the t th time step
wt is updated decreased by division with a factor for t



l is the minimum value of i for which wi d n holds see du et al
for details and wl is set to zero
in step g the set that will contain the summary is initialized as an empty set
note that g is supposed to be an independent set according to the denition of matroid given earlier in this section
by condition in the denition of matroids stated earlier in this section an empty set is independent
step iterates through the dierent values of t
step tests for each z text element v if g remains an independent set by the inclusion of z
only those z s are chosen in this step whose inclusion expands g already an independent set to another independent set
step selects a z permitted by step for inclusion in g if f g z f g wt
this z is added to g in step
that is z is added to g if the increment of f by the addition of z is not less than the threshold wt
for t wt that is the maximum value of f for any z v
this means the z which maximizes f is added to g
note that there can be multiple z for which f is maximized
in that case the tie is broken arbitrarily
the remaining z s may or may not be added to g based on the threshold value
another important point to note is that our chosen f see equation is designed to mize both coverage and diversity
so even if multiple z satisfy step they may not be added to g in step if they contain redundant information
the value of wt is relaxed for the subsequent values of t to allow text elements producing relatively lower increments of f to be considered for possible inclusion in g
indicates that for the nal value of t at least one text unit z which does not decrement f is added to g
this ensures that the coverage of the summary produced is not compromised while preserving diversity
this process steps to is repeated for t


l l resulting in the nal output g
the reason for the eciency of algorithm is the fact that this algorithm does not perform exhaustive evaluation of all the possible submodular functions evolving in the intermediate steps of the algorithm
the reduction in the number of steps in the algorithm is achieved mainly by decreasing wt geometrically by a factor of
in addition multiple elements z can be added to g for a single threshold which also expedites the culmination of the algorithm
pre and post processing mechanisms for fair summarization in this section we discuss our proposed pre processing and post processing summarization rithms to produce fair summaries

classwisesumm pre processing algorithm for fair summarization we now describe a simple pre procesing algorithm for fair summarization
suppose that the tual units in the input belong to t classes


zt and to conform to a desired fairness notion the summary should have ci units from class zi i


t using the same notations as in tion
the simplest way to generate a fair summary is to separately summarize the textual units belonging to each class zi to produce a summary of length ci and nally to combine all the t maries to obtain the nal summary of length
we refer to this method as the classwisesumm method
specically in this work we use our proposed algorithm fairsumm without any fairness constraints to summarize each class separately
however any other summarization algorithm can be used to summarize each class separately

refasumm post processing algorithm for fair summarization in this section we discuss our proposed post processing mechanism for generating fair summaries which can be used along with any existing summarization algorithm
many summarization rithms including the ones stated in section generate an importance score of each textual unit in the input
the textual units are then ranked in decreasing order of this importance score and the top ranked k units are selected to form the summary
hence if the ranked list of the textual units can be made fair according to some desired fairness notion then selecting the top from this fair ranked list can generate a fair summary
we refer to this algorithm as refasumm re ranking fairly the summarization output
fairness in ranking systems is an important problem that has been addressed recently by some works
we adopt the fair ranking methodology developed by zehlike et al
to generate fair summaries
the fair ranking scheme in considers a two class setting with a majority class and a minority class for which fairness has to be ensured adhering to a ranked group ness criterion
their proposed ranking algorithm named ensures that the proportion of the candidates items from the minority class in a ranked list never falls below a certain ed threshold
specically two fairness criteria are ensured selection utility which means every selected item is more qualied than those not selected and ordering utility which means for every pair of selected candidates either the more qualied is ranked above or the dierence in their qualications is small
we propose to use the algorithm in for fair extractive text summarization as follows
note that this scheme is only applicable to cases where there are two groups e

the claritin and metoo datasets
we consider that group to be the majority class which has the higher number of textual units tweets in the input data while the group having lesser textual units in the input is considered the minority class
input and parameter settings the algorithm takes as input a set of textual units to be rized the other input parameters k i and p taken by the algorithm in are set as follows
qualication qi of a candidate in our summarization setting this is the goodness value of a textual unit in the data to be summarized
we set this value to the importance score computed by some standard summarization algorithm e

the ones discussed in section that ranks the text units by their importance scores
expected size k of the ranking the expected number of textual units in the summary k
indicator variable i indicating if the candidate is protected we consider that group to be the minority class which has the lesser number of textual units in the input data
all tweets posted by the minority group are marked as protected
minimum proportion p of protected candidates we will set this value in the open interval and excluded so that a particular notion of fairness is ensured in the summary
for instance if we want equal representation of both classes in the summary we will set p

adjusted signicance level we regulate this parameter in the open interval
working of the algorithm two priority queues for the textual units of the majority class and for the textual units of the minority class each with capacity k are set to empty
and are initialized by the goodness values of the majority and minority textual units respectively
then a ranked group fairness table is created which calculates the minimum number of minority textual units at each rank given the parameter setting
if this table determines that a textual unit from the minority class needs to added to the summary being generated the algorithm adds the best element from to the summary s otherwise it adds the overall best textual unit from to s
thus a fair summary s of desired length k is generated adhering to a particular notion of fairness decided by the parameter setting
note that since the algorithm provides fair ranking for two classes only we look to apply this algorithm for summarization of data containing tweets from exactly two social groups i
e
the claritin and metoo datasets only
it is an interesting future work to design a fair ranking algorithm for more than two classes and then to use the algorithm for summarizing data from more than two social groups
experiments and evaluation we now experiment with dierent methodologies of generating fair summaries over the three datasets described in section
pre processing the datasets we performed standard pre processing on the datasets including stopword removal and stemming using porter stemmer
all summarization algorithms were cuted on these pre processed datasets

parameter settings of algorithms the following parameter settings are used
for all datasets we generate all summaries of k tweets
the proposed algorithm fairsumm uses a similarity function j to measure the similarity between two tweets i and j
we experimented with the following two similarity functions tfidfsim we compute tf idf scores for each word unigram in a dataset and hence obtain a tf idf vector for each textual unit
the similarity j is computed as the cosine similarity between the tf idf vectors of i and j
embedsim we obtain an embedding a vector of dimension for each distinct word in a dataset either by training on the dataset or by considering pre trained glove beddings
we obtain an embedding for a tweet by taking the mean embedding of all words contained in the tweet
j is computed as the cosine similarity between the embeddings of tweets i and j
we found that the performance of the fairsumm algorithm is very similar for both the similarity measures
hence we report results for the tfidfsim similarity measure
for our post processing algorithm the one based on fair ranking the value of the parameter c needs to be decided see section

we try dierent values of c in the interval using grid search and nally use c
since this value obtained the best rouge scores on the claritin and metoo datasets

baselines to our knowledge there is no existing fair text summarization algorithm
hence we consider the standard text summmarization algorithms stated in section as baselines
additionally we have used our proposed fairsumm algorithm described in section without considering any fairness constraints as a separate baseline
we call this summarization algorithm dicosumm a tion algorithm that is optimized for both diversity and coverage but not considering any fairness constraints
next we compare the performance of the dierent fair summarization algorithms with all the baselines

results and insights we now describe the results of applying various fair summarization algorithms over the three datasets
some sample summaries obtained by using various algorithms are given in appendix b
to evaluate the quality of summaries we compute and recall and scores by matching the algorithmically generated summaries with the gold standard summaries scribed in section
table reports the results of summarizing the claritin dataset
we compute summaries without any fairness constraint and considering the two fairness notions of equal sentation and proportional representation explained in section
in each case we state the number of tweets in the summary from the two user groups and the rouge scores of the summary
ilarly table and table report the results for the metoo dataset and the us election dataset respectively
the fairsumm algorithm in processing algorithm and the classwisesumm algorithm processing algorithm are executed over all three datasets
for the two class claritin and metoo datasets we also apply our post processing methodology stated in section
where a fair ing scheme is used for fair summarization results in table and table
specically we use our post processing methodology over the existing summarization algorithms described in section such as clusterrank lexrank summarnn summacnn
the resulting fair summarization algorithms are denoted as fair clusrank fair lexrank fair summarnn fair summacnn and so on
note that for generating a xed length summary the neural models use only the textual units labeled with ranked as per their condence scores
hence in fair summarnn and summacnn methods we have considered the ranked list of only those textual units that are beled with
insights from the results we make the following observations from the results shown in ble table and table

in processing and post processing methods perform better than pre processing across all datasets the in processing fairsumm algorithm achieves higher rouge scores than wisesumm considering the same fairness notion
note that in the classwisesumm approach the same fairsumm algorithm is used on each class separately
hence the pre processing approach of separately summarizing each class leads to relatively poor summaries as compared to the processing fairsumm methodology
this dierence in performance is probably because if similar tweets opinions are posted by dierent social groups classwisesumm can include multiple ilar posts in the summary thereby leading to redundancy in the summary
on the other hand fairsumm optimizes coverage and diversity across all textual units taken together thereby ing redundancy in the summary
the in processing fairsumm algorithm and some of the post processing approaches achieve comparable performances

also we can compare the performances of the existing summarization algorithms e

dsdr lexrank summarnn without any ness constraint and after their outputs are made fair using the methodology in section

we nd that the performances in the two scenarios are comparable to each other
in fact for a few cases the rouge scores marginally improve after the summaries generated by an algorithm are made fair over those of the original summary generated by the same algorithm
thus making summaries fair does not lead to much degradation in summary quality as measured by rouge scores
overall the results signify that the proposed fair summarization algorithms can not only ensure various fairness notions in the summaries but also can generate summaries that achieve ble or better rouge scores than many well known summarization algorithms which often do not generate fair summaries as demonstrated in section

eect of degraded information of gender in metoo dataset number of tweets written by the two user groups in the whole dataset and the summaries of length tweets generated by fairsumm algorithm
also given are the and recall and scores of each summary
each result is averaged over random experiments for each of the error rates

eects of degraded information of demographic details our proposed algorithms assume the availability of class information of the textual units under consideration e

gender information for the tweets in claritin and metoo datasets and ical leaning for tweets in the us election dataset
in cases where such class information is not available we need to resort to inference mechanisms
for instance there are multiple ologies to infer demographic details of people from their writing styles with a high level of racy
moreover in social media additional information can be utilized to infer graphic details of their users such as user names and prole pictures
similarly sentiment analysis can be deployed to infer the opinions
however such inferences may not be absolutely perfect and the accuracy of these inference methodologies will eventually decide how well the predicted labels replicate the true class labels
in this section we check how the inaccuracy in the inference mechanism may impact the performance of the proposed fairsumm algorithm
experimental setup we performed these experiments for all the three datasets and obtained qualitatively similar results
hence for brevity we are reporting the experimental results only on the metoo dataset
we assume the existence of a classier which can infer the gender information of the authors of textual posts required for our fairsumm algorithm with certain level of error for the metoo dataset
to simulate the eect of a classier with error rate we change the class labels i
e
consider the inferred label to be male if the true label was female and vice versa of randomly selected of the tweets in the dataset
now this degraded information of gender labels is given as input to the fairsumm algorithm to create the fair summaries
we experiment with error rates
for every error rate we repeat the experiment times and then report the average results over all experiments
note that for checking the fairness property i
e
the proportion of tweets from various groups in the summaries we use the true labels and not the inferred labels
observations table reports the results obtained over the metoo dataset with increasing amount of noise error in the demographic labels
as expected the error noise in the demographic inference has some eects on the fairness property that the summaries are meant to satisfy
with ing error rate in the prediction of the class labels the summaries deviate further from the desired fairness criterion
however it is interesting to note that even with degraded demographic mation the summaries generated by fairsumm have better fairness property than the summaries generated by many of the baseline algorithms
also it is evident from table that the degradation in the availability of demographic details does not aect the quality of the summaries much as measured by rouge scores
in fact even with the degraded gender information the fairsumm algorithm outperforms many of the existing summarization algorithms in terms of rouge scores
hence we can conclude that though the accuracy of the inference methodology is an important factor when the actual class information is not present especially in order to achieve the fairness goals the quality of summaries produced by fairsumm is generally robust to such noise in the inferred labels
concluding discussion to our knowledge this work is the rst attempt to consider fairness in textual summarization
through experiments on several user generated microblog datasets we show that existing rithms often produce summaries that are not fair even though the text written by dierent social groups are of comparable quality
note that we do not claim the existing algorithms to be tentionally biased towards against any social group
since these algorithms attempt to optimize only one metric e

textual quality of the summary the unfairness comes as a side eect
we further propose algorithms to generate high quality summaries that conform to various standard notions of fairness implementations available at
com fairsumm
git
these gorithms will help in addressing the concern that using a inadvertently biased summarization algorithm can reduce the visibility of the voice opinion of certain social groups in the summary
moreover downstream applications that use the summaries e

for opinion classication and rating inference would benet from a fair summary
limitations and future directions there are potential limitations of the fair summarization gorithms presented in this paper
all three algorithms need as input the class e

socially salient group information to which each textual unit belongs
where such class information is not ily available we need to infer these information which may impact the fairness objectives to some extent as discussed in section

a major limitation of refasumm comes from the fair ranking algorithm being applied in the post processing phase
the framework is designed for scenarios where only two socially salient groups are dened e

male and female
hence our post processing algorithm is presently applicable only in such cases
we plan to extend refasumm to more than two classes in future work
we also note that in certain special cases the fair summarization algorithms developed in this work may lead to degradation in the summary quality
for example let us assume a scenario where we are summarizing tweets posted by two equally sized groups of users

group a and group b and the fairness objective is to achieve equal representation i
e
both groups should have the same number of tweets in the summary
now if the variability of opinions within the groups are dierent e

everyone from group a has the same opinion on an issue while people in group b have many varied opinions on the same issue then the proposed method will not generate a good summary because there will be redundant tweets posted by users of group a while some of the diverse opinions posted by users of group b may not be included in the summary
hence if the distribution of opinions is very dierent from the distribution of people belonging to dierent social groups then the summaries may not be of good quality
this situation leads us to an interesting question of whether to look for fair representation across demographic groups or for fair representation across the dierent opinions a question that we would like to investigate in future work
going beyond summarization deciding the social grouping is often a normative question in many socio technical applications which requires decisions at the policy level
in some tions legal doctrines may suggest what should be the social grouping which often emerges from long deliberations and historical contexts whereas in other cases the corresponding online forms such as social media sites like facebook or twitter may have their own guidelines to decide groups they want to be considerate about
similar to most of the recent algorithms trying to porate group fairness including fair classication algorithms the algorithms proposed in this paper also consider the grouping to be given apriori
however questions on what constitute the right grouping are important and should be more widely discussed in the research community
finally looking at a higher level fairness preserving information ltering algorithms like the ones proposed in this paper are of signicant societal importance
today social media sites are the gateway of information for a large number of people worldwide and the algorithms search recommendation sampling summarization
deployed in these sites act as the gatekeepers
if these algorithms lack the sense of embedded ethics or civic responsibilities they may not be fully suitable to curate information for the heterogeneous society
thus incorporating fairness in algorithms is the need of the hour
as discussed in section recent research works are taking correct steps in that direction
likewise we believe that our work will open up multiple interesting research problems on fair summarization such as extending the concept of fairness to abstractive summaries or estimating user preferences for fair summaries in various applications and will be an important addition to the emerging literature on fairness in algorithmic decision making

appendices a fairsumm mathematical details this section describes fairsumm our proposed in processing algorithm for fair summarization in more detail
this algorithm treats summarization as an optimization problem of a submodular monotone objective function where the fairness requirements are applied as constraints
in this section we rst establish the theoretical premise of our algorithm and then describe our algorithm
the symbols used in this section are given in table
a
submodularity and monotonicity denitions let v


vn be the set of elements to be summarized where each vi represents a textual unit e

a tweet
we dene a function f r the set of real numbers that assigns a real value to a subset say s of v
our goal is to nd s v such that k where r is the desired length of the summary specied as an input and for which f is maximized i
e
s armaxb v f b
so from a set of textual units v we look to nd a summary s that maximizes an objective function f
denition discrete derivative for e v and a function r let s s be the discrete derivative of at s with respect to e
denition submodularity a function is submodular if for every a b v and e v b i
e
e v and e b this property is popularly called the property of diminishing returns
denition monotonicity the function is monotone or monotone nondecreasing if for every a b v f a b symbols meanings set of textual units to be summarized number of textual units to be summarized number of classes to which the textual units in v belong e

t for metoo dataset t for us election the t classes of the textual units summary conforming to fairness notions s v desired length of summary minimum number of textual units from class zi to be included in s to satisfy a given fairness notion v n t f l i g

the main symbols used in appendix a
properties we now discuss some of the important properties of monotone submodular functions which we will exploit in our problem formulation
property the class of submodular functions is closed under non negative linear combinations let


fn dened by fi r i


n be submodular functions and


n be non negative real numbers
then proof this is a well known property of submodular functions e

see hence the proof is omitted
n i i fi is also submodular
property the class of monotone functions is closed under non negative linear combinations let


fn dened by fi r i


n be monotone functions and


n be non negative real numbers
then proof let v
then since each fi is a monotone fi fi
let f case i let i for all i


n
then f and is a constant non decreasing function
case ii let i for all i


n
then we can write n i i fi is also monotone
n i i fi
fi fi i fi fi n n i fi i fi i i n n f f
case iii let only some m m and m n i s
let without any loss of generality such i s be


m
then we have fi fi i fi fi m m i fi i fi i for i


m i fi i fi i for i m m


n m n m n f f this completes the proof
property the class of monotone submodular functions is closed under non negative linear binations let


fn dened by fi r i


n be monotone submodular functions and


n be non negative real numbers
then proof this follows trivially from properties and
property given functions f r and r r the composition f f r i
e
f f s is nondecreasing sub modular if f is non decreasing concave and f is nondecreasing submodular
proof this is also a well known property of submodular functions e

see hence the proof is omitted
i i fi is also monotone submodular
a
formulation of the objective function for summarization we now look for an objective function for the task of extractive summarization
following the formulation by lin et al
we use monotone submodular functions to construct the objective function
we consider the following two aspects of an extractive text summarization algorithm coverage coverage refers to amount of information covered in the summary s measured by a function say l
the generic form of l can be simi j i s j v where simi j denotes the similarity between two textual units tweets sentences
i v and j v
thus measures the overall similarity of the textual units included in the summary s with all the textual units in the input collection v
note that l is monotone submodular
l is monotonic since coverage increases by the addition of a new sentence in the summary
at the same time l is submodular since the increase in l would be more when a sentence is added to a shorter summary than when a sentence is added to a longer summary
there can be several forms of l depending on how simi j is measured which we will discuss later in this paper
diversity reward the purpose of this aspect is to avoid redundancy and reward diverse mation in the summary
let the associated function be denoted as r
a generic formulation of r is k j s j pi s where


pk comprise a partition of v such that i pi v and pi pj for all i j r j is a suitable monotone submodular function that estimates the importance of adding the textual unit j to the summary
the partitioning


pk can be achieved by clustering the set v using any clustering algorithm e

k means based on the similarity of items as measured by j
rewards diversity since there is more benet in selecting a textual unit from a partition cluster that does not yet have any of its elements included in the summary
as soon as any one element from a cluster pi is included in the summary the other elements in pi start having diminishing gains due to the square root function
the function r j is a singleton reward function since it estimates the reward of adding the singleton element j v to the summary s
one possible way to dene this function is r j j i which measures the average similarity of j to the other textual units in v
note that is tone submodular by property since square root is a non decreasing concave function
this formulation will remain monotone submodular if any other non decreasing concave function is used instead of square root
while constructing a summary both coverage and diversity are important
only maximizing coverage may lead to lack of diversity in the resulting summary and vice versa
so we dene our objective function for summarization as follows f where are the weights given to coverage and diversity respectively
note that by property f is monotone submodular
our proposed fairness preserving summarization algorithm will maximize f in keeping with some fairness constraints
we now discuss this step
a
submodular maximization using partition matroids for fairness preserving summarization we essentially need to optimize the submodular function f while ensuring that the summary includes at least a certain number of textual units from each class present in the input data
this problem can be formulated using the concept of partition matroids as described below
denitions we start with some denitions that are necessary to formulate the constrained mization problem
denition matroid a matroid is a pair m z i dened over a nite set z called the ground set and a family of sets i called the independent sets that satises the three properties empty set i
if y i and x y then x i
if x i y i and then there exists e y x such that x e i
denition partition matroids partition matroids refer to a special type of matroids where the ground set z is partitioned into disjoint subsets


zs for some s and i s s z and zi ci for all i


s for some given parameters


cs
thus s is a subset of z that contains at least ci items from the partition zi for all i and i is the family of all such subsets
formulation of the constrained maximization problem consider that we have a set of trol variables e

gender political leaning each of which takes tj distinct values e

male and female democrat and republican
each item in z has a particular value for each
for each control variable we can partition z into tj disjoint subsets


zjtj each corresponding to a particular value of this control variable
we now dene a partition matriod mj z ij such that ij s s z and zji cj for all i


tj for some given parameters


ctj
now for a given submodular objective function a submodular optimization under the tion matriod constraints with p control variables can be designed as follows maximizes z s subject to s p i
a prior work by du et al
has established that this submodular optimization problem under the matroid constraints can be solved eciently with provable guarantees see for details
a
proposed summarization scheme in the context of the summarization problem the ground set is v z the set of all textual units sentences tweets which we look to summarize
the control variables stated in section a
are analogous to the sensitive attributes with respect to which fairness is to be ensured
in this work we consider only one sensitive attribute for a particular dataset the gender of a user for the claritin dataset political leaning of a tweet for the us election dataset and the media source for the dataset
let the corresponding control variable be z and let z take t distinct values e

t for the claritin dataset and t for the us election dataset
note that as described in section a
the formulation can be extended to multiple sensitive attributes control variables as well

let


zt zi v for all i be the disjoint subsets of the textual units from the t classes each associated with a distinct value of z
we now dene a partition matroid m v i in which v is partitioned into disjoint subsets


zt and i s s v and zi ci


t for some given parameters


ct
in other words i will contain all the sets s containing at most ci sentences from zi


t
outside the purview of the matroid constraints we maintain the restriction that ci s are chosen such that i ci the desired length of the summary s and t a desired fairness criterion is maintained in s
for instance if equal representation of all classes in the summary is desired then ci we now express our fairness constrained summarization problem as follows t for all i
maximizes v f s subject to s i
where the objective function f s is as stated in equation
the suitable algorithm to solve this constrained submodular optimization problem proposed by du et al
is presented as algorithm
the g produced by algorithm is the solution of equation
this algorithm is an ecient alternative to the greedy solution which has a time complexity of where n and k
on the other hand it can be shown that the time complexity of du et al
is n where is a factor to be explained shortly
the reason for this eciency is the fact that this algorithm does not perform exhaustive evaluation of all the possible submodular functions evolving in the intermediate steps of the rithm
instead it keeps on decreasing the threshold wt by a dividing factor which skips the evaluation of many submodular functions and sets the threshold to zero when it is small enough
it selects elements z from the ground set in our case v only at each threshold value to evaluate the marginal gain f g z f g without violating any constraints
lo n note that the theoretical guarantee of algorithm depends upon the number of partition troids p i
e
the number of control variables and the curvature of f given by cf maxj v p see for details in our setting the number of partition the approximation ratio is troids p is
algorithm for fair summarization algorithm presents the algorithm to solve this constrained submodular optimization problem based on the algorithm developed by du et al

the g duced by algorithm is the solution of equation
we now briey describe the steps of rithm
in step the maximum value of the objective function f that can be achieved for a text unit v is calculated and stored in d
the purpose of this step is to compute the maximum value of f for a single text unit and set a selection threshold to be described shortly with respect to this value
this step will help in the subsequent selection of textual units for the creation of the summary to be stored in g
wt dened in step is such a threshold at the t th time step
wt is updated decreased by division with a factor for t



l is the minimum value of i for which wi d n holds see du et al
for details and wl is set to zero
in step g the set that will contain the summary is initialized as an empty set
note that g is supposed to be an independent set according to the denition of matroid given earlier in this section
by the condition in the denition of matroids stated earlier in this section an empty set is independent
step iterates through the dierent values of t
step tests for each z text element v if g remains an independent set by the inclusion of z
only those z s are chosen in this step whose inclusion expands g already an independent set to another independent set
step selects a z permitted by step for inclusion in g if f g z f g wt
this z is added to g in step
that is z is added to g if the increment of f by the addition of z is not less than the threshold wt
for t wt that is the maximum value of f for any z v
this means the z which maximizes f is added to g
note that there can be multiple z for which f is maximized
in that case the tie is broken arbitrarily
the remaining z s may or may not be added to g based on the threshold value
another important point to note is that our chosen f see equation is designed to mize both coverage and diversity
so even if multiple z satisfy step they may not be added to g in step if they contain redundant information
the value of wt is relaxed for the subsequent values of t to allow text elements producing relatively lower increments of f to be considered for possible inclusion in g
indicates that for the nal value of t at least one text unit z which does not decrement f is added to g
this ensures that the coverage of the summary produced is not compromised while preserving diversity
this process steps to is repeated for t


l l resulting in the nal output g
the reason for the eciency of algorithm is the fact that this algorithm does not perform exhaustive evaluation of all the possible submodular functions evolving in the intermediate steps of the algorithm
the reduction in the number of steps in the algorithm is achieved mainly by decreasing wt geometrically by a factor of
in addition multiple elements z can be added to g for a single threshold which also expedites the culmination of the algorithm
b sample summaries of the datasets we give some examples of summaries generated by the dierent summarization algorithms cussed in the paper on two datasets i metoo dataset and us election dataset
the datasets are described in detail in the original paper
all summaries showen here are of length k tweets
b
summaries of metoo dataset here are few summaries produced with dierent fairness constraints of the metoo dataset
summary produced by sumbasic algorithm tweets by females tweets by males abusers are nt victims opportunists are nt crusaders

this is what sonam mahajan who i once considered a friend did to me
telling this now seeing her blatant bigotry hypocrisy around metoo
all the rapes and metoo metooindia allegations give raise to one question
when will it stop but the questions must be when did it start and how long has it taken for us to standup against it i need inuencers to help me get the word out
i need if people to follow me rt
i need a dateline long format interview to talk to oprah
i need funding and support
i am alex jones ex wife i am not the underdog
i am you
i am america metoo can change this
apparently i m only scared because of metoo even though the movement did nt exist at the time good to see india s top uni take a no nonsense approach to sexual harassment in academia metoo iisc shows door to top professor on charges of sexual harassment the rst story on talk dammit was mine
the rst person i opened up to about having been molested as a child was faizan
please do nt believe this attention seeking bully of a woman faizan has been there for me and countless others even before there was a metoo movement
also the jokes
the jokes
if i now shake hands with you will you yell metoo it is that funny is it women and so many men nally found the strength to share the stories of sexual misconduct and assault and some men need to joke about it
and it would be because of the actions of a few girls like meghasharma who abuse metoo one day it will probably have its own metoo movement as a mark of protest
metoo ignores evidence and that s not right cause a man is human and he has the rights as woman but they does nt understand that
feministsaremonster allowing a clear serial sexual predator to run one of your labels is a bad look crecords
you need to drop now
metoo believewomen my model friend has taken the initiative to come forward and speak about his metoo experience in the fashion industry
lead the way kawal
proud of you
hope more men come forward to expose their experience with the predators around
tanand metooindia it is becoming more commonplace for schools to oer support groups for boys
here they feel safe to discuss their emotions and learn to navigate their relationship with girls in the metoo movement boy talk breaking masculine stereotypes metoo dies a little more everyday
bryan singer is back at work
woody allen is getting support
james gunn is back at work
harvey weinstein is pretty much on the verge of being cleared of any charges
ceelo green is back on the voice
america really does nt care about rape
for ladies in gambia
i m working on a series of survivor stories within the context of metoo told exactly as the survivors would choose
if you re a survivor or know someone who is comfortable with it and would want to share their story please dm me
ask in the light of metoo movements and harvey weinsteins how do they feel about using money and lawyers to silence victims under ndas instead of letting justice run its course how did they address the problem in their organizations trump is right a vote for republicans on november is a vote for him
its a vote against women a vote against freedom of speech a vote for racism a vote for hate crimes a vote for acceptance of his lies
metoo jamalkhashoggi magabomber pittsburghsynagogueshooting if the fear about metoo is false accusations against men then the gop shouldnt be fering to women to make false allegations against robert mueller arewegreatenoughyet still better than the sports masseur who said i lit him up like a christmas tree stroked the side of my breast put his penis in my upturned palm said he d love to put cameras all over my house so he could watch me all day


i just ca nt even


metoo sexualharassment salmans is an issue of domestic violence
not to be conated with metoo
diluting the def of metoo will dampen its impact
its def should be restricted to people in power sexually exploiting the weak
not domestic violence or failed ships it takes immense courage to this young woman ananya to express and write her story really the time s up this young actress faced lots of mental emotional physical abuse from another woman metoo please read her story in the fb link with this tweet

in the current climate of metoo if someone did that to you at your place of work would you just let it go or should it be considered sexual assault
another thing you are not alone in its been mentally consuming for me it was was one of your tweets shared but that pushed me through my silence and made me share my story we are all in this together and its high time so be proud metoo

can you take back the shame and humiliation this guy faced bcoz of what you have done to him he should seriously le defamation case against you metoocontroversy metoo excellent news should have happened right away but good that it happened now thanks to for doing the right thing meanwhile suhel seth continues to hide in whatever hole he s crawled into metoo
party coming to sm disclosing his proof of innocense he is having access to those ministers who r appointed as gom in metoo campaign but he preferred to come to sm bcoz he knows vote matters even they would have not listened to genderappeasement now think about

it is not just suhel seth s silence
it s also the unacceptable silence of many in media who knew him professionally and socially
i did too like many others
i spoke up but i can count on one hand those of us who have demanded accountability from him metoo where are others too bad you do nt really believe in the power of truth
how can you live with yourself knowingly voting for an alcoholic abuser of women
next time i am sexually assaulted i will rst ask if anyone would like to witness for prosperity s sake metoo screw you

metoo a year ago today i thought my world was falling apart
i woke up to nd out that the hashtag metoo had gone viral and i did nt see any of the work i laid out over the previous decade attached to it
i thought for sure i would be erased from a thing i worked so hard to build
i admire the courage of all the victims who spoke out against sexual rassment abuse
s resignation is a moral victory for everyone
the defamation case ca nt change that
the metoo movement needs support across party lines
that to they lied and now they want to lynch every man on earth
the whole metoo is stupid
its dangerous to believe every woman
no man is safe anymore when someone does nt like you they cry metoo
it can happen to everyone are women that weak that they need a hashtag to speak out i m sure women are strong enough to ght without social media
atleast women around me are
metoo needs to be stopped because it does really promote more fake cases
instead ght the real one bravely and we support u
as i cry and succumb to mental exhaustion because of i remember the ships women forged and solidarity we showered upon each other
each one of you who has helped supported fought the war been there relentlessly i will never forget
thank you

survivorculture metoo i have been asking media houses to debate this but these spineless guys do nt ever discuss such incidents
biased media could only talk metoo at prime time to demean the men of this country
poor guard with no mistake is behind bars
jago jago harashtra if these same signs had pictures of transgender african americans holding metoo signs there would be rioting looting and protests
the right would be called white supremacists and nazis for it
the double standard is real and easy to see
the question was nt about if women are ous or not it was if women are more agreable then men do nt change the topic
the answer is no give more present than women help more others on their works do nt do metoo do nt ask for divorce at if a woman shares a metoo without evidence it s taken to be true coz it s a women s timony a man coming out with hetoo story people would be doubtful question the evidences the intent will never except the man as victim
