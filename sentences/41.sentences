introduction the aim of this text is to discuss in a rather critical way the so called many worlds pretation mwi proposed originally by h
everett in
i am a proponent of the pilot wave interpretation pwi dened by l
de broglie in and d
bohm in and while mwi shares with pwi a strong commitment for determinism there are also mental dierences between the two approaches
the most important one concerns probably how both theories attempt to interpret quantum probability within their own ontological frameworks and this will be the topic of the present chapter
as i will show however mwi is more dicult to accept than pwi in the sense that it has dramatic problems with its ontology which can not be ignored if we want to interpret probabilities
first let us say a few words about ontology
mwi and pwi are realistic approaches to quantum mechanics
this means that they are trying to introduce a clean ontological structure into the formalism of quantum mechanics
what is indeed so extraordinary about quantum mechanics is that the formalism appeared in without a clear ontological framework in complete opposition with classical approaches
instead n
bohr w
berg m
born and others managed to develop a pragmatic and instrumentalist interpretation in which only macroscopic apparatuses and detectors possess a clear denition
this way of thinking very much in harmony with the dominant positivism of this time relies on the need to consider as existing only what is seen by an observer i
e
the so called quantum observable
in classical physics this positivistic approach was already introduced by the philosopher e
mach with his phenomenalistic philosophy of science and by the chemist w
oswald with his strong criticism of atomism i
e
in his debate with l
boltzmann
the logical positivism of m
schlick r
carnap p
franck and h
reichenbach perpetuated this methodology in the xx s century and considered that ontology is pure metaphysics and should be removed of any positive science actually they are strongly mistaken any science is necessarily metaphysical on its theoretical ground as shown already by d
hume
theory is a pure creation of the human mind and needs to be tested with experimental facts
this is the basis of the hypothetico deductive method which was in particular fended by l
boltzmann and later by a
einstein in his debated with w
heisenberg and n
bohr
however bohr s way of thinking is not completely identical to these various itivist approaches
for bohr the problem is mainly experimental and is associated with the existence of the quantum of action
indeed the classical ontologies based on waves and particles are not able to give a clear unambiguous picture of quantum reality as shown for instance by the famous wave particle duality paradox
therefore one should try a dierent minimalist approach in which these classical concepts while necessary for the empirical scription of phenomena do not have the same ontological values as in the classical world
the copenhagen interpretation says something like that take the schrodinger equation with its wave function t and its hamiltonian h
do nt try to see a physical propagation i of a wavy thing use it as a practical tool for dening a probability obtained by a classical observer
the observer sentient or not detector or automaton are part of the tation as well possesses a well dened position in space and time and is therefore foreign to the quantum formalism
quantitative statements are introduced into the theory through born s probability rule which reads t t h t i i t where p the probability of the outcome associated with the observable operator a is related to the quantum state by squaring the norm of the amplitude we have the eigenvalue relation a i i
ontological questions about what happens to t h i where the system between the preparation and the measurement are beyond the scope of bohr s interpretation
this answer is ne for an experimentalist in his lab and can be used with condence for all practical purposes fapp
however this methodology keeps open some unsolved fundamental questions
questions such as the meaning of the wave function for the universe or the schrodinger cat or wigner s friends or the heisenberg shifty split and so on and so forth are very pertinent and they can not simply be escaped by labeling them metaphysical
after all the quantum wave theory was developed by schrodinger before bohr gave his interpretation and there is no reason why the copenhagen method should be the only pertinent one
actually the situation is even a bit ironical since bohr s interpretation came only of late
de broglie proposed his own double solution theory already in before the schrodinger equation was discovered broglie was using the klein gordon equation which he invented for his own purpose
schrodinger proposed his own theory in
in fact de broglie s view contains as a sub product the pwi while schrodinger s if correctly interpreted in the conguration space has as a necessary consequence mwi as is recognized by everett himself in his phd thesis
ii
everett and bohm now i will try to dene briey the ontology of mwi and pwi
i will start with pwi
in pwi the wave function t has an ontological meaning independently of the existence or nonexistence of the observer
t is an actual guiding wave in a real quantum eld i i for particles which are somehow surng on the wave
here i will be rather conservative and consider only the non relativistic case for a single particle of mass m without magnetic potential
the velocity of the point like particle in pwi is given by i m m t t
this guidance formula is enough for solving paradoxes such as wave particle duality by dening a complex trajectory for the particle
the wave carries the particle into regions where the eld is non vanishing and omits regions where the quantum eld cancels therefore oering a contrasting view to the bohr heisenberg dictum that such kind of representation should be prohibited in the same way the famous no go theorem by von neumann vanishes into pure smoke
alternatively we can introduce a quantum potential q acting on the particle and modifying the newtonian force induced by the external potentials v t
in the conguration space for many particles


the theory is highly nonlocal and can be used to solve the einstein podolsky rosen paradox in full agreement with bell s theorem
i point out that i was deliberately quite unprecise and vague concerning the nature of the quantum eld
indeed in pwi guides the particles but there is no reaction of the particle on the wave
it is for this reason better to wait for a better understanding of the ontology of the wave function in the future
probably pwi if it survives will have to be modied or completed by a more satisfying theory in which particles and elds manifested through waves will be dynamically connected
this was the hope of both broglie and bohm with dierent strategies and we should not here comment further
anyway even if such a theory would exist one day this does nt mean that the current pwi will not be correct anymore in the same way that newton s theory of gravitation is not completely invalidated by general relativity
additionally as it was pointed out many times by broglie there is a strong analogy between the status of in the pwi and the action t in the old hamilton jacobi theory
therefore we will here only consider as an eective eld or a nomological entity keeping its understanding for future works
now of course pwi makes sense only if we can introduce probabilistic elements into the theory in order to explain born s formula eq

schrodinger s equation contains enough material to do that unambiguously
indeed from the local current conservation law j t with t t and t t it is obviously natural to interpret t as a density of presence for the particle located at at time t
the local conservation plays the role of liouville theorem s in statistical chanics
therefore if t is eectively interpreted as a density of probability of presence p t at a given time the interpretation will still be valid at any other times in agreement with the conservation law
this was essentially the reasoning of broglie in and of bohm in
however one can try to go further and attempt to justify the probability law with other assumptions
this will be very similar to modern statistical p t t mechanics trying to justify the microcanonical or canonical boltzmann gibbs ensemble with deeper reasonings
several attempts have been done in the recent years focussing on either h theorem coarse graining boltzmann typicality and deterministic chaos for a review see
i will not discuss that further since my aim was only to point that pwi is very similar to classical physics no better no worse
the diculties and questionings about equilibrium and non equilibrium cited by boltzmann are now translated in the pwi framework into the question of how to justify the uniqueness of quantum equilibrium and how to reach such an equilibrium
the solutions are probably very similar for the classical and quantum cases but the role of entanglement and non locality is still not so clear so that solving the problem in classical statistical mechanics would give a strong insight on the quantum pwi version
let us now turn to mwi
as said before mwi is mainly the strict application of schrodinger s original theory in the conguration space
in mwi is an ontological eld tity as in pwi
but here there is not particle at all only a continuous wave for schrodinger describes a local electron in the case of the single electron the wave function e t charge density not a probability
the quantum eld t in such a theory is somehow very similar to the classical electromagnetic eld in the old fashioned maxwell s theory or to the metric tensor in general relativity
in recent years practitioners and proponents of a measure of existence or a degree mwi in particular l
vaidman often called of reality the denition of l
vaidman is more general of course but it agrees with t mine if by existing quantum world we mean a state like
however since there is no i preferred basis in the hilbert space the choice is arbitrary
this is clearly reminiscent of schrodinger s language about charge density
of course if we think of the electron as a delocalized charge distribution we get the obvious objections already given by bohr and heisenberg that a wave packet is spreading through space and time and that this could not explain the experimental facts where electrons are appearing as localized grains or quanta on detectors
in a diraction or interference experiment the electron would go through both holes and could not create a singular event on the screen
this is the well known historical reason why the schrodinger solution was quickly abandoned already in
furthermore observe that already for a single electron wave function the spatial coordinate representation does nt have any particular status in the theory
we could also have chosen a momentum representation instead of this would not have modied the information contained into k i i the quantum state
therefore there is no privileged basis in the mwi of schrodinger and everett in the same way that it is not more or less physical to consider the fourier transform of an electromagnetic eld as more or less real than the eld itself
however we have something new in quantum physics
a superposition such as here i there for a i single electron means that two wave packets localized in the space are superposed
since however experiments show that an electron is only detected here or there it seems to us that mwi should have fundamental diculties in dealing with this reality
however everett resurrected schrodinger s theory by introducing entanglement in the many particles conguration space
his hope was that entanglement added to the schrodinger idea would solve completely the measurement paradox and all other tions
we will see that this is not so easy
to start with entanglement consider an ideal two particle universe
in the coordinate representation and at a given time t the wave function for the system is written t
what is here the meaning of and for a single electron is a spatial coordinate labeling the point in the space
but here we have two points of coordinates and
this means that if we want to interpret t as an ontological eld we should extend a bit the classical framework of eld theory
generally in classical eld theory we consider only local elds dened at a gle position
the eld itself can obey a nonlinear equation in order to create for example solitons or bunched eld
here however the quantum eld require two coordinates for its denition and
this involves a new form of non locality or wholeness while the equation i
e eq
is kept strictly linear
how to call such a eld maybe could be a good alternative name to wave function since it actually represents a correlation between two or many points in space and time
the theory can of course be extended to the relativistic domain using the tomonaga schwinger equation for the functional where is a space like hyper surface in the universe
now how will this solve the paradox of the spreading electron which was a dead end for the old schrodinger interpretation consider again our wave function t
suppose at the initial time the system factorizes i
e
t t
we can take t as a freely expanding wave packet diracted by an external potential like a double slit screen the fact that the screen or more generally an external potential is a classical concept is here irrelevant and it is there only to simplify the discussion
the second wave function t is associated with a localized wave packet conned in for example a coulomb potential let s says in a energy level
when the rst electron collides with the second the system can exchange energy and mentum and this represents some information transfer to be used in a basic measurement protocol
in other worlds the modication of the second electron state will lead to glement and non locality
consider the nal state pi t where the sum is over possible outcomes
if we consider only a two state system for i then we have here a basic electron detector plate with the ground state meaning undetected while the excited states are recorded
of course we could also introduce a third electron localized in state t before the interaction and actually factorized from the rest of the wave function
after the interaction we will obtain a state like t t


where the dots indicate other terms irrelevant for the present purpose for example the states where electrons and are not disturbed by the interaction
clearly we have here an entanglement representing a basic spatial correlator the equivalent in optics would be an hanbury brown and twiss apparatus
if electron is in the excited state then electron is in the ground state and reciprocally this is or information associated with two dierent bits
in the language of bohr s interpretation this would mean that an observer can only detect a particle once since there is only one electron
however here we are not in the copenhagen instrumentalist framework but in the mwi
our universe contains only three electrons and no observer at all
still with everett s web function eq
represents an ontological eld and the dierence between and is completely i i real in an objective sense for example those states are orthogonal in the hilbert space
however now comes the fundamental issue since there is no collapse how should we interpret the superposition given by eq
in mwi a state like equivalently be written there is no observer able to collapse the state this equivalent representation shows that we i could also
since i i i i i do nt have yet our macroscopic world where electrons appear either here or there but not at both places
while entanglement allowed us to describe a measuring device in quantum mechanics i
e
it constitutes an example of the shifty split of the heisenberg cut it did nt apparently remove our problem in the mwi
in other words the fact that we considered more and more electrons did nt solve the problem it only propagated it to a larger system thanks to entanglement
still it was everett s hope that entanglement could somehow solve the measurement issue how could that be everett s strategy was to consider larger and larger systems until we can consider a conscious being or at least machines or robots suciently sophisticated to have memory sequences of recorded events
the hope was that at a certain scale to be dened the collapse i
e
in the language of the mwi the split should occur
this is what we should now analyze
considering the previous example i
e
eq
we see that entanglement will indeed propagate to any other systems in interaction with our detectors
if the detector is emitting a signal going to a larger system able to memorize i
e
to modify in a rather stable way a chemical or molecular arrangement in a mechanical brain we can imagine entangled state such as t t i


i with obvious notations for the states of the brain
i point out that the ket notation for is the the brain is a compact way of speaking about


xn where n h i number of particles in the brain including its environment the detectors and ultimately all the universe
however the representation chosen is here irrelevant
furthermore we have here obviously since the unitarity of the quantum evolution should preserve h i the orthogonality of the pointer states present in eq
i
e

the h i brain states are of course physical states since with everett and von neumann we accept psychophysical parallelism that is the functionalist view whereby the mind supervenes on the brain like software on hardware
everett s strong belief was that the state of awareness or consciousness of the observer or robot is a new essential ingredient in the theory
however do nt forget that everett believed strongly in functionalism and that for him the introduction of minds in quantum mechanics was very dierent from what was later assumed by believers in the so called many minds in which minds dierent of brain states i
e
without obvious supervenience relations with the hardware played a fundamental role as well
i will not discuss such alternative approaches here since the abandonment of the psychophysical parallelism is denitely too much for me
going back to eq we see that these two awareness states exist and evolve as if they were alone
the reason is that they constitute two independent solutions of eq
i will develop that important point below
but as we said before unitarity allows many representations of eq
like for example i i i i


here we have superposed cat states the meaning of which is unclear
what is i i the feeling of a brain in such a cat state is this not a fatal problem for mwi are we not introducing furtively a new axiom favoring a representation i
e
a preferred basis at the detriment of not preserving full unitarity however we point out that for everett the awareness basis is not so much privileged but better considered as special or particular in the sense that we are always free to use a dierent basis if we wish
therefore unitarity is not violated
still to be convincing the mwi should explain why is not an awareness state
may be there are actually such mental states like but that we can not feel how it is to be like them
maybe i i i i the question is a bit like asking how it feels like to be a bee or a cat
maybe not
this is a bit magic or mysterious for many and it is probably why some tried to shift from the mwi to the many minds
of course if the two brain states evolve independently there is no apriori reason to mix them but what is more is that we can apparently use an argumentation based on inter subjectivity and entanglement to see why we never meet people in such cat states
indeed if i met you in the street going out of the lab we could create an entangled state like t me you t me you


i i therefore there has to be an inter subjective agreement between awareness states of me and you
moreover like for eq
and there are also states like me you me you but i now they involve me you and all the part of the universe having interacted with us
there is thus an agreement between the cat states since eq
can be written like t t me you t t me you i i me you me you i


i but you should not bother about this since neither me nor you are feeling such cat states separately
however this argumentation is not completely convincing to everyone see for example penrose since there are apparently other counterintuitive ways to write eq

for instance what about writing eq
like t me t me you i you i i t i you t me i me you i i i


the cat state for you are now involved while i am mixed with the rst electron state
the well known problem with such an expression is that it is not obvious and univocal to torize the me and you like i did this is the reason why i wrote me and you inside the same ket vector in eqs

indeed the two protagonists are strongly interacting with a complex environment
the possibility to separate me from you is therefore in large part arbitrary and in practice physically impossible in the lab
where to put the border tween me and you is a bit a question of taste
this is clearly reminiscent of the wigner s friend paradox if before interacting with my friend i am in the state me me it is hoped that after meeting we should be in a state like me you i me you i and that i i possible state factorization does nt make any sense
also for the same reason a state like you me border separating me from you is fuzzy and shifty
we would like to obtain some kind of i i i i i you can not be easily factorized as me me you since the me superselection rules here in order to prove that such strange cat states are forbidden in nature
for such reasons many proponents in the mwi like d
zeh or d
wallace and s
saunders following also w
zurek often emphasize that decoherence should be taken into account in this argumentation
decoherence is the averaging of an operator over the irrelevant degrees of freedom ciated with the environment
the idea is that a macroscopic quantum object like a brain should be considered as an open system interacting with its environment
by averaging over degrees of freedom associated with this environment we can transform a pure system into a mixture characterized by for example rate equations
overlap terms between dierent possible environments will decay in time very quickly so that we can use a mixture instead of a pure evolution in the hilbert space
this is a nice way for removing quantum ences from a reduced evolution and it is reminiscent of the famous which path experiment in as a the young double slit setup
decoherence supposes already that we can interpret probability in agreement with born s rule eq

this creates problems for both bohr s and everett s interpretations but not for the pwi
indeed for bohr the observer or the apparatus is a key ingredient
but tracing over some degrees of freedom means that the environment is actually needed as an observer in this theory the environment is watching you
this is an amendment to the original copenhagen interpretation but this is not actually so dramatic since the theory is instrumentalist so that improving on it does not really touch the problem of ontology
this problem does nt exist at all for the pwi since probabilities have a classical meaning here
tracing over the environment will only introduce a supplementary emerging ignorance like in thermodynamics
for the mwi however there is no yet probability so that decoherence can not be interpreted in the same way
we have only degrees of reality and measure of existence so that tracing actually means summing over some of these degrees of reality
how can this help the mwi it seems rather to create additional problems
the answer is not so clear because in my opinion proponents of the mwi did nt yet reach a consensus
one point which is often emphasized is that the privileged basis should be very robust in the sense that only in this basis is the system immune to the interaction with the environment
this means in particular that if an experimentalist was able to prepare and the system should decohere isolate during even a short period a superposition like very fastly i
e
in a time probably smaller than
while this result is generally i i interpreted using probability it has also an absolute meaning as a measure theoretical way to dene eective orthogonality between independent observer branches
in this context the ideas of d
wallace on patterns are very interesting for the mwi
what is a pattern referring to d
dennett s work wallace interprets a pattern like a cat or a tiger as an emerging structure inside the quantum evolution
the border of an emerging structure is not always clearly dened at the macroscopical scale since the number of atoms is huge
including some atoms in you or me is a bit arbitrary so that we generally do nt care about this shifty border between observers
we already discussed this problem before and we should develop this a bit more
rigorously we should call a pattern any complete solution of eq
for a given hamiltonian
referring again to the single tron problem if and the sum i i i are separate solutions and therefore patterns then is also representing a viable pattern of the theory
however i the linearity does nt destroy the individual patterns here and there and in that sense it really means that we have two localized electrons here
in the same sense and i are i representing patterns if they are independent solutions of the full evolution including the environment
the linear superposition eq
is also an allowed pattern so that we have ally two me here one happy and one unhappy wallace calls that favoring multiplicity over superposition
moreover while the orthogonality of the states was here a consequence of the orthogonality of the pointer states this is not necessary
two solutions of eq
can be viable patterns without being orthogonal
still in practice decoherence will ensure that is a good approximation after a very short time due to the complexity of the h environment neglecting poincare recurrence over the nite time of human or universe i existence and we could say that decoherence somehow create and select emerging patterns behaving classically i
e
without interference from the full spectrum of possible solutions those solutions that have no good thermodynamical properties are not considered
there is an important point to emphasize here considering a single photon of energy e interacting with a beam splitter we generally say that we end up with two independent possibilities reected and transmitted which are added and represent two independent i i pattern solutions of the free hamiltonian
this is however an approximation since the ary conditions at the beam splitter make these two solutions inseparable
only the sum reected practical purposes we are dealing with nite wave packets well localized in space and time
i i is a solution of the time independent scattering problem
still for transmitted this means that after interacting with the external potential the beam splitter we can approximately and asymptotically consider the two solutions reected i as independent and evolving freely
so when we say that we end up with two independent i transmitted and branches this is already an approximation even with very simple systems and without ing macroscopic decoherence
i mention that because it is also trivially true for eqs
and or and patterns like i are not actually made of two independent sub solutions but only constitute complete and me you me you t t t t i i i inseparable solutions of the full universal evolution
if you think about that then you realize that indeed and can not in general be rigorously independent patterns albeit seen i i as emerging and approximate structures whose condition is very robust due to h i decoherence
of course cat patterns as given in eqs
and are not exact solutions as well and we can not really separate them from the full evolution
this at least shows that the old debates about a preferred basis in the mwi is a bit empty
however if patterns have only an approximative meaning they also let the question about the meaning of cat states unanswered
it is probably better for these reasons to return to our provocative i answer to be a in a state like i i is perhaps a bit like feeling as a bee or a cat
maybe it is here with us during all our life
maybe not
the ontology of the mwi is denitely very strange and debates about its self consistency will certainly continue during many years in many worlds
iii
probability in the many worlds interpretation well if this is enough for the ontology in the mwi interpretation what about ity this is the weaker worst point in the theory and it stirred up so much emotional debates within the years that it could be too long to summarize all points and tations here
additionally since decoherence needs a denition of probability to work it seems that introducing probability could also help the ontological problem in the mwi
now everett introduced probability in his mwi in two ways
the rst way is actually predating gleason s theorem which everett discovered independently in a simplied version
i will not summarize this well known reasoning but just remind that its aim is to nd the most plausible measure in the hilbert space which could represent a bility of occurence
the result using some natural assumptions about linearity is that the most natural measure is the one given by born s law i
e
eq

still this is not yet a probability but just the proof that if we are going to attribute a probability to the state then born s law is the best choice
in the recent years d
deutsch d
wallace and s
saunders on the one side and w
zurek on the other side tried to nd an alternative mathematical demonstration using some other symmetries called envariance by zurek and decision theory by deutsch than those considered by gleason and everett
the reasoning is that due to entanglement we can in a natural and mathematical way give a precise statement for laplace s principle of indierence in the quantum world
the result is of course again born s law
for me the gleason version and the envariance demonstration have the same value
they both show that if one is going to introduce probability in the quantum world and therefore in the mwi then eq
is the most natural choice
but still there is no ned for probability in the mwi outside from experimental considerations foreign to the theory
at that stage it is interesting to make a remark
everett and later many authors such as wallace and brown or zurek often claimed that their bayesian denition of probability is no better nor worst than in classical physics so that the situation is the same as for the pwi
everett for example wrote the situation here is fully analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics where one puts a measure on trajectories of systems in the phase space by placing a measure on the phase space self and then making assertions such as ergodicity quasi ergodicity
which hold for almost all trajectories
by almost everett means here a measure theoretic denition like the one proposed by lebesgue
however having a measure is not enough to dene a ability
for example we could use noether symmetry theorem which shows that maxwell equations involve a conserved current and interpret this result as a probability
still this is not necessary i
e
not required by the theory
we need a clear ontological statement for introducing probability in a theory and this involves dynamical elements like particle randomness
in the pwi for example the conservation law j t is clearly not enough to generate the probability interpretation it only gives an indication
as a proof observe that madelung found simultaneously with broglie the guidance formula and the quantum potential
but he interpreted them instead as continuous hydrodynamic uid equations more in phase with the old schrodinger interpretation
modern practitioners of the mwi often think that by comparing their own approaches with the one developed for instance by gibbs using liouville s theorem could give a legitimacy to the various concepts of probability they propose
however gibbs statistical mechanics is nothing without the physical interpretation proposed by boltzmann and maxwell within the kinetic theory as gibbs himself recognized in the introduction to his book
therefore we should not try to extract too much from gleason s theorem decision theory or envariance
to introduce anyway probability we should love to the second step of everett s reasoning and consider a statistical experiment
suppose for instance a single quantum source ting photons one by one all directed on a balanced beam splitter
each photon is either transmitted or reected with equal probabilities and the detectors i
e
avalanche diodes register singular events in only one of the two path at once
the statistics is of course a simple bernoulli process and the result following the weak law of large numbers is naturally in agreement with born s rule that the number of photons detected in each detectors are equal on the long run
now this is of course a reading which make sense in bohr s instrumentalist interpretation as well as in the pwi
in the the pwi photons follow trajectories determined by eq
or some equivalent and by the initial conditions in the wave packets i
e
for example the particle s position at a given time
the theory is very similar to classical mechanics and therefore the pwi contains enough ingredients to introduce statistics in quantum mechanics
in the mwi this is not the case since the continuous wave or eld is all what we have
the wave packet impinging on the beam splitter behaves like a classical maxwell wave it is separated into two equal parts but there is no probability in this construction
however should we be surprised the mwi is indeed based on the pure unitary schrodinger ics which only accepts the regular solution of eq

there is no singularity no ne graining in this theory for generating randomness
it is therefore surprising that everett in his thesis followed by b
dewitt and his student n graham believed that probability could appear in the long run in the mwi
it is of course true that in a bernoulli process with n repetition of the beam splitter experiment there is w nt nt possible branches in which nt photons are transmitted while n nt photons are reected
using stirling formula n we get w n n this is a crude approximation in the long run limit n for nt n which means that the overwhelming majority of the erett branches will be following born s law
still this has only value in a measure theoretic sense
we added branches to nd a degree of reality equal to w but nowhere there is a reason why we should do that
in the same way that typicality is not probability there is here no possibility for extracting a tend to from a
additionally for practical experiments we do nt use an innite number of registered events
the pwi can deal with that only because the theory is deterministic and because randomness only results from the choice of the initial conditions for the particle positions
there is no need for an innite number of events in the same way that in kinetic theory a gas does nt contain an innite number of molecules the gibbs ensemble is just an idealization after all
i stress that my comments are somehow well known and that we can still nd some proponents of the mwi who are convinced that everett s answer is the good one
in the recent year d
wallace and s
saunders following the ideas of d
deutsch introduced bayesianism into the mwi in order to save the theory this is what they called decision theory following l
j
savage
quoting d
wallace on his discussion on patterns we have at least shown that it is rational for the observer to assign some weighting in other words we have shown that there is room for probabilistic concepts at least the decision theoretic sort to be accommodated in the theory
in other words the observer does nt know where he will go after branching so that it seems legitimate to call that a bayesian choice
or is it not bayesianism following ramsey or de finetti is mainly a subjective interpretation of probability based on inferences and degrees of belief as used by poker players or insurance companies
still a poker player can only use his subjective notion of probability in nection with empirical evidences
such empirical evidence means frequency of occurrences i
e
ideally using an innite sequence following von mises
however our remarks made earlier concerning gibbs s ensembles
therefore we are sent back to our rst criticism concerning the everett dewitt graham reasoning
as we explained before the unitary schrodinger evolution is too regular and simple for implying objective probability and randomness
and it is therefore dicult for me to derstand how some could even hope to obtain physical probability directly from subjective bayesianism my criticism concerns also the new trends about qbism even though qbism is actually the copenhagen counterpart of the decision theoretic view on the mwi
thermore i am feeling that the whole game of decision theory is a bit like meeting a pair of twins or clones see the very suggestive zaxtarian scenario proposed by b
green based on the sleeping beauty analogy by l
vaidman and asking one of them what was the probability to be the other
in that case at least ontogenesis the ne grained structures make some dierence but with the quantum states the symmetry is too high and the ne graining unlike in the pwi absent
why therefore should we introduce ity this is not convincing and the problem is not that the observer does nt know where he will go but rather that he will actually choose both ways since he will soon be sliced into two quantum clones
the mwi is deterministic and there is no hidden variable with unknown initial conditions which could tell you what was the path you really followed in a quantum interferometer
therefore how can we speak of some results being likely and others being unlikely when both take place in one sense the strong symmetry required by zurek s envariance i
e
the quantum version of laplace s indierence principle already ruins the chance of success of the mwi in justifying the use of bayesian probability
over the years l
vaidman often emphasized as a kind of last chance for the mwi that ability should be postulated in the mwi
if this is true then we completely denature the dream of everett and therefore we will at the end obtain something like a new version of the pwi and return to the original broglie s proposal
in the following i will describe some alternatives to the old mwi which indeed are going to explore this analogy with the pwi
iv
saving the many worlds in the recent years several approaches have been proposed to modify or complete the mwi
i already mentioned the various many minds interpretations
such approaches include in the theory some new ingredients which look a bit like hidden variables in the pwi in some versions the minds are indeed ying over the wave function like the electron is surng the guiding wave in the pwi this is a romantic view
i will not analyze here such provocative ideas but the point is indeed that one way of saving the mwi is to go in the direction of the pwi
this is what is interesting to me here since the proposal is actually going far beyond the realm of the many minds
indeed the analogy with the pwi is for example the path proposed by a
valentini in his many bohmian worlds theory
such an approach is also advocated by several authors like f
j
tipler and k
j
bolstrom
the main point is that the pwi allows a description of the wave function of the whole universe by adding a gibbsian ensemble of universes to the theory
indeed if we consider and innite number of copies of such a universe all characterized by the same wave function but in which the trajectories for the large vector associated with the n particles of the universe in the conguration space dier only by the choices concerning the initial conditions then we have a theory where many bohmian worlds exist independently of each others
this reminds us of the old criticism by d
deutsch about pwi as a mwi in a permanent state of chronical denial
here the aim is clearly to satisfy both pwi and mwi proponents by reversing the critics
by introducing many copies of the universe we could maybe understand how the quantum potential can depend on the wave function itself
n
rosen who was one of the rst to study the pwi even before bohm gave up on this theory because it was not acceptable for him that a quantum potential q should depend somehow on the probability density remember that for a single non relativistic particle we have q
de broglie renounced his pwi in m in part for similar reasons if the wave function is a subjective element the word is from de broglie then how could a dynamics depends on statistics de broglie came back to pwi in since this problem was not anymore a serious one for him
still we can motivate the many bohmian worlds view by introducing the quantum potential as a kind of interaction between the dierent worlds
actually this is even the only justication for the many bohmian worlds view
personally i am not so much convinced but the theory is ne to study anyway since we do nt know yet where it will lead us
to conclude this chapter i would like to discuss a dierent provocative proposals for modifying the mwi which i imagined some years ago
since i am not taking it too seriously i will call that model the jumper interpretation ji
in the ji the idea is to nd a stochastic approach based on the mwi
i will consider rst a single electron described by t
my suggestion is that at any time there is a single particle in the wave like in the pwi
the particle is located at at time t
the density of probability that it will be found at x at any other time is simply given by t t
that s more or less all
the evolution is completely stochastic and if the wave is going to be diracted then the electron is jumping from one place to a dierent one simply using born s rule
as inpwi there is an obvious privileged basis here the spatial coordinate representation but we could choose a dierent one
also the dynamics can look crazy
first the electron at time t has a non vanishing probability to appear at any place in the t wave whatever the distance separating the two points and x the velocity can therefore diverge
second consider a particle interacting with a beam splitter
after crossing the apparatus we have now two separated wave packets
still from my ji the particle can jump from one beam to the other completely randomly and this even if there is a huge distance between them and even if there is a thick wall as an obstacle
the theory also requires a privileged lorentz frame like pwi
indeed since there is not limit for velocity the trajectories are allowed to go backward in time in some reference frames
a privileged slicing of space time allows us to dene unambiguously the possible probability of reaching a point using born s rule calculated in this preferred frame
t actually this model is a minimalist version of the pwi
instead of being deterministic it is stochastic
but still it shares with the pwi many common features
in particular in a state like the particle is in one place at a time if we choose to favor i i the representation
if we take as preferred basis the momentum representation then the system will not have position at all but rather a jumping momentum k in the distribution
this ji could also be used to explain the epr paradox by including entanglement and by generalizing it to any possible hilbert space for example to k i h include spin or polarization variables
consider for example a perfectly entangled photon pair state like h i h v v i i i where h v denote horizontal and vertical polarization for photons and
we require a preferred basis for describing the stochastic dynamics let say h i and i v i i but the choice could be dierent from pair to pair
when the pair of photons is produced by the source it jumps randomly from time to time into the states h h or v
now the epr i i v i i pair is directed in the bell experiment with polarizing beam splitters and wave plates for selecting polarization bases
due to the presence at each time of both waves h h and i i v v the outcomes will follow the quantum predictions
the situation will be like for the pwi involving a non locality this time not due to the quantum potential but to the i i mere existence of the two independent branches h i i i i h and v v one full one empty at each time
the ji can be easily extended to measurement situations like the one described by eq
with many electrons
since we have privileged some ket basis in this theory the quantum state has a non ambiguous meaning in such a basis
this is again very similar to the pwi
here however the choice of the privileged basis is arbitrary i could have chosen a momentum space instead of a spatial coordinate this is my free ontological assumption
now of course there is this strange randomness induced by the jump of particles in the wave function
what is this jump going to imply for the brain states and to the observers are they going also to jump or to see these electrons jumping if the electrons are jumping in front of my eyes then the theory is of course invalidated
but this is again a hidden variable model and actually the nice thing is that this jump is really hidden in the same way that bohmian trajectories are hidden in the pwi
indeed we see rst that if we consider an awareness state like



xn written in the preferred basis the question of the basis choice is h i again arbitrary but to x it let s say that i am working mainly with spatial coordinates the spin degrees of freedom then the mind somehow supervenes on the n particles position at a given time this is also true for the pwi
second in a state like eq




xn t t



xn t t h i



xn t


h i there is only one electron at and one brain whatever that means located at



xn
like for the pwi it does nt matter if we use eq
with awareness states or eq
with cat states




xn t in both the probability of presence is given by the same number
now the question about patterns plays an



xn t important role here and discussing it now will also bring some new insights to the pwi
what is important indeed is that in both the present ji and in the pwi the whole system only occupies one position x



xn at any time only restricted by the condition



xn t measurement and that
now you should remember that we are speaking about a quantum t and t are not spatially overlapping at least at some time t
it means that we have either or



xn t t



xn t



xn t t



xn t depending on whether the electron position is located in the support of or
the functionalist theory together with the existence of particles therefore imposes that we can only be in one of the two awareness states this trick is not possible in the old mwi interpretation since there is no preferred basis in eq

additionally it apriori gives a reason to impose the spatial coordinates as preferred basis since using momentum with its delocalized quantum states k could not lead to such a clean resolution of the observer identity crisis
this is i think a very good reason to prefer the pwi over the mwi
now with the present stochastic model the state given by eq
represents an electron and the detectors as jumping together
the three entangled electrons will jump from randomly between two arbitrary times
in the state given by eq
to i i with an observer entangled with electron the whole system should also jump but again only together
that means that the observer can not feel this jump at all if he is jumping all his memory sequence and the environment is jumping with him this why i called the theory crazy
furthermore if other observers are included in the formalism see eq
then the subjective agreement will also be automatic in the appropriate basis and you will jump with me always in agreement with quantum mechanics
i emphasize that this ji is certainly a schematic structure not to be taken too seriously but i think that it contains mainly all the ingredients for a good hidden variable theory
in particular the concept of probability used in the model is clear enough to bypass all the contradictions contained in the mwi
as a further development we could also present a many jumpers interpretation similar in philosophy to the many bohmian worlds approach discussed before
again this could bring some philosophical advantages for explaining how the particles know where to jump
the inter communication between the dierent jumping worlds brings indeed such an information to the whole ensemble of universes and with this we will conclude our many stories theory

wallace often criticized the frequentist view using the well known redundancy with the weak law of large numbers
indeed this weak law is sometime used improperly as a proof of the long run probability formula
however since the weak law already needs probability with its frequentist denition to run there is obviously a kind of circularity and this motivates wallace s bayesian reading of probability
i however think that the naive view that the weak law is a proof of something like the frequentist interpretation is not exact
the frequentist view indeed is not proven by the weak law of large number it only shows that this view is consistent with itself
actually the frequentist view as often taught is too simple for exhausting the full physical complexity of randomness
as i mentioned gibbs ensembles are pure idealization and what we need is actually a physical postulate concerning the initial conditions of the universe
if these conditions impose that over molecules will be in state and n in state then we have already a good basis for probability
however this is not enough in order to have a good random universe since in the long run a maverick result like


with arriving rst and after is not random but would however satisfy the naive frequentist view
in my opinion we must also add a physical postulate similar to boltzmann stosszahlansatz telling that the repartition of and in the nite sequence is somehow random as determined by initial conditions
this postulate would for example mean that the molecules with state and are homogeneously distributed over the box or the universe considered and that the observer should pick up a fair sample when making a statistics
i agree that mathematicians will not like my postulates but in my opinion probability should be a physical science before being a domain for mathematicians
in other words probabilities are only pure idealizations in a deterministic universe and they only approximately convey a language for what we call chance and randomness
unfortunately we do nt have a better one
