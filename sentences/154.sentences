v i x r a abstract a major proportion of a text summary includes important entities found in the original text
these entities build up the topic of the mary
moreover they hold commonsense formation once they are linked to a knowledge base
based on these observations this per investigates the usage of linked entities to guide the decoder of a neural text summarizer to generate concise and better summaries
to this end we leverage on an off the shelf entity linking system els to extract linked entities and propose t a module easily attachable to a sequence to sequence model that transforms a list of entities into a vector representation of the topic of the mary
current available els s are still not ciently effective possibly introducing solved ambiguities and irrelevant entities
we resolve the imperfections of the els by coding entities with selective disambiguation and pooling entity vectors using rm tion
by applying t to a simple to sequence model with attention mechanism as base model we see signicant ments of the performance in the gigaword sentence to title and cnn long document to multi sentence highlights summarization datasets by at least rouge points
introduction text summarization is a task to generate a shorter and concise version of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text
the task can be vided into two subtask based on the approach tractive and abstractive summarization
tive summarization is a task to create summaries by pulling out snippets of text form the nal text and combining them to form a summary
abstractive summarization asks to generate maries from scratch without the restriction to use amplayo and lim are authors with equal tribution
names are arranged alphabetically
figure observations on linked entities in summaries
summaries are mainly composed of entities
entities can be used to represent the topic of the mary
entity commonsense learned from a large corpus can be used
the available words from the original text
due to the limitations of extractive summarization on incoherent texts and unnatural methodology yao et al
the research trend has shifted towards abstractive summarization
sequence to sequence models sutskever et al
with attention mechanism bahdanau et al
have found great success in generating stractive summaries both from a single sentence chopra et al
and from a long document with multiple sentences chen et al

ever when generating summaries it is necessary to determine the main topic and to sift out essary information that can be omitted
to sequence models have the tendency to include all the information relevant or not that are found in the original text
this may result to cise summaries that concentrates wrongly on relevant topics
the problem is especially severe when summarizing longer texts
in this paper we propose to use entities found in the original text to infer the summary topic the los angeles dodgersacquired south koreanright hander jae seofrom the new york metson wednesdayin a four player swap

gating the aforementioned problem
specically we leverage on linked entities extracted by ploying a readily available entity linking system
the importance of using linked entities in rization is intuitive and can be explained by ing at figure as an example
first in the ure aside from auxiliary words to construct a tence a summary is mainly composed of linked entities extracted from the original text
second we can depict the main topic of the mary as a probability distribution of relevant ties from the list of entities
finally we can leverage on entity commonsense learned from a separate large knowledge base such as wikipedia
to this end we present a method to fectively apply linked entities in sequence sequence models called t
t is a module that can be easily attached to any sequence to sequence based summarization model
the module encodes the entities extracted from the original text by an entity linking system els constructs a vector representing the topic of the summary to be generated and informs the decoder about the constructed topic vector
due to the imperfections of current els the extracted linked entities may be too ambiguous and coarse to be considered relevant to the summary
we solve this issue by using entity encoders with lective disambiguation and by constructing topic vectors using rm attention
we experiment on two datasets gigaword and cnn with varying lengths
we show that ing our module to a sequence to sequence model with attention mechanism signicantly increases its performance on both datasets
moreover when compared with the state of the art models for each dataset the model obtains a comparable mance on the gigaword dataset where the texts are short and outperforms all competing models on the cnn dataset where the texts are longer
thermore we provide analysis on how our model effectively uses the extracted linked entities to duce concise and better summaries
usefulness of linked entities in summarization in the next subsections we present detailed guments with empirical and previously examined evidences on the observations and possible issues when using linked entities extracted by an entity linking system els for generating abstractive summaries
for this purpose we use the opment sets of the gigaword dataset provided in rush et al
and of the cnn dataset vided in hermann et al
as the mental data for quantitative evidence and refer the readers to figure as the running example

observations as discussed in section we nd three tions that show the usefulness of linked entities for abstractive summarization
first summaries are mainly composed of linked entities extracted from the original text
in the ample it can be seen that the summary contains four words that refer to different entities
in fact all noun phrases in the summary mention at least one linked entity
in our experimental data we tract linked entities from the original text and pare them to the noun phrases found in the mary
we report that
and
of the noun phrases on the gigaword and cnn datasets spectively contain at least one linked entity which conrms our observation
second linked entities can be used to represent the topic of the summary dened as a multinomial distribution over entities as graphically shown in the example where the probabilities refer to the relevance of the entities
entities have been viously used to represent topics newman et al
as they can be utilized as a controlled cabulary of the main topics in a document hulpus et al

in the example we see that the tity jae seo is the most relevant because it is the subject of the summary while the entity south korean is less relevant because it is less tant when constructing the summary
third we can make use of the entity sense that can be learned as a continuous vector representation from a separate larger corpus ni et al
yamada et al

in the ample if we know that the entities los les dodgers and new york mets are american baseball teams and jae seo is a baseball player associated with the teams then we can use this formation to generate more coherent summaries
we nd that
of the extracted linked ties are covered by the pre trained in our experimental data proving our third observation

com idio
possible issues despite its usefulness linked entities extracted from els s have issues because of low precision rates hasibi et al
and design challenges in training datasets ling et al

these issues can be summarized into two parts ambiguity and coarseness
first the extracted entities may be ambiguous
in the example the entity south korean is biguous because it can refer to both the south korean person and the south korean language among
in our experimental data we tract the top entities based on frequency and the entities extracted from randomly selected texts and check whether they have biguation pages in wikipedia or not
we discover that
of the top entities and
of the entities picked at random have disambiguation pages which shows that most entities are prone to ambiguity problems
second the linked entities may also be too mon to be considered an entity
this may duce errors and irrelevance to the summary
in the example wednesday is erroneous because it is wrongly linked to the entity wednesday night baseball
also swap is irrelevant because though it is linked correctly to the entity trade sports it is too common and irrelevant when generating the summaries
in our experimental data we randomly select data instances and tag the correctness and relevance of extracted tities into one of four labels a correct and evant b correct and somewhat relevant c rect but irrelevant and d incorrect
results show that


and
are tagged with a b c and d respectively which shows that there is a large amount of incorrect and vant entities
our model to solve the issues described above we present t a module that can be easily attached to any sequence to sequence based stractive summarization model
t encodes the linked entities extracted from the text and forms them into a single topic vector
this vector is ultimately concatenated to the decoder hidden state vectors
the module contains two ules specically for the issues presented by the tity linking systems the entity encoding ule with selective disambiguation and the pooling submodule with rm attention
overall our full architecture can be illustrated as in figure which consists of an entity ing system els a sequence to sequence with tention mechanism model and the t module
we note that our proposed module can be ily attached to more sophisticated abstractive marization models zhou et al
tan et al
that are based on the traditional decoder framework and consequently can produce better results
the code of the base model and the t are available

base model as our base model we employ a basic decoder rnn used in most neural machine lation bahdanau et al
and text tion nallapati et al
tasks
we employ a two layer bidirectional gru bigru as the current unit of the encoder
the bigru consists of a forward and backward gru which results to sequences of forward and backward hidden states h n h h tively h n and h


h


h gru xi h gru xi h h h i the forward and backward hidden states are concatenated to get the hidden state vectors of the tokens i
e
hi h i
the nal states of the forward and backward gru are also nated to create the nal text representation vector of the encoder s h
these values are h n calculated per layer where xt of the second layer is ht of the rst layer
the nal text representation vectors are projected by a fully connected layer and are passed to the decoder as the initial hidden states s
for the decoder we use a two layer directional gru with attention
at each time step t the previous token the previous hidden state and the previous context vector are passed to a gru to calculate the new hidden state st as shown in the equation below
st gru
wikipedia
org wiki south
com korean figure full architecture of our proposed sequence to sequence model with t module
the context vector ct is computed using the additive attention mechanism bahdanau et al
which matches the current decoder state st and each encoder state hi to get an importance score
the scores are then passed to a softmax and are used to pool the encoder states using weighted sum
the nal pooled vector is the context vector as shown in the equations below
globally disambiguating encoder one way to disambiguate an entity is by using all the other entities putting more importance to entities that are nearer
for this purpose we employ an based model to globally disambiguate the entities
specically we use bigru and concatenate the forward and backward hidden state vectors as the new entity vector gt a uahi i at ihi at i ct i finally the previous token the current context vector ct and the current decoder state st are used to generate the current word yt with a softmax layer over the decoder vocabulary as shown below

entity encoding submodule after performing entity linking to the input text ing the els we receive a sequential list of linked entities arranged based on their location in the text
we embed these entities to dimensional vectors e


em where rd
since these entities may still contain ambiguity it is necessary to resolve them before applying them to the base model
based on the idea that an ambiguous entity can be disambiguated using its neighboring entities we introduce two kinds of disambiguating encoders below
h gru ei h gru ei h i h i h h locally disambiguating encoder another way to disambiguate an entity is by using only the rect neighbors of the entity putting no importance value to entities that are far
to do this we ploy a cnn based model to locally disambiguate the entities
specically we do the convolution operation using lter matrices wf rhd with lter size to a window of h words
we do this for different sizes of h
this produces new ture vectors ci as shown below where
is a non linear function ci h


bf the convolution operation reduces the number of entities differently depending on the lter size
to prevent loss of information and to produce the same amount of feature vectors ci h we pad the entity list dynamically such that when the lter size is h the number of paddings on each side is h
the lter size h therefore refers to the number of entities used to disambiguate a middle entity
finally we concatenate all feature vectors the los angeles dodgers acquired south korean right hander jae seofrom the new york mets on wednesday in a four player swap

ultimately the submodule outputs the disambiguated entity vectors

pooling submodule the entity vectors e are pooled to create a gle topic vector t that represents the topic of the summary
one possible pooling technique is to use soft attention xu et al
on the vectors to determine the importance value of each vector which can be done by matching each entity vector with the text vector s from the text encoder as the context vector
the entity vectors are then pooled using weighted sum
one problem with soft tention is that it considers all entity vectors when constructing the topic vector
however not all tities are important and necessary when ing summaries
moreover a number of these tities may be erroneous and irrelevant as reported in section

soft attention gives non negligible important scores to these entities thus adds essary noise to the construction of the topic vector
our pooling submodule instead uses rm tention mechanism to consider only top k entities when constructing the topic vector
this is done in a differentiable way as follows a e uas g k top p sparse i gi pi i aiei ai t i where the functions k top gets the indices of the top k vectors in g and p sparse creates a sparse vector where the values of k is and
the sparse vector p is added to the original tance score vector g to create a new importance use to represent
figure entity encoding submodule with selective disambiguation applied to the entity
the left ure represents the full submodule while the right gure represents the two choices of disambiguating encoders
of different h s for each i as the new entity vector i ci


the question on which disambiguating encoder is better has been a debate some argued that using only the local context is appropriate lau et al
while some claimed that additionally using global context also helps wang et al

the rnn based encoder is good as it smartly makes use of all entities however it may perform bad when there are many entities as it introduces noise when using a far entity during disambiguation
the cnn based encoder is good as it minimizes the noise by totally ignoring far entities when ambiguating however determining the ate lter sizes h needs engineering
overall we argue that when the input text is short e

a tence both encoders perform comparably wise when the input text is long e

a document the cnn based encoder performs better
selective disambiguation it is obvious that not all entities need to be disambiguated
when a correctly linked and already adequately biguated entity is disambiguated again it would make the entity very context specic and might not be suitable for the summarization task
our tity encoding submodule therefore uses a selective mechanism that decides whether to use the biguating encoder or not
this is done by ducing a selective disambiguation gate d
the nal entity vector ei is calculated as the linear globally disambiguating encoder disambiguating encoder score vector
in this new vector important scores of non top k entities are
when softmax is plied this gives very small negligible and to zero values to non top k entities
the value depends on the lengths of the input text and mary
moreover when k increases towards ity rm attention becomes soft attention
we cide k empirically see section

extending from the base model module extends the base model as follows
the nal text representation vector s is used as a context vector when constructing the topic vector t in the pooling submodule
the topic vector t is then concatenated to the decoder hidden state vectors si i

the concatenated vector is nally used to create the output vector oi wcci i related work due to its recent success neural network els have been used with competitive results on stractive summarization
a neural attention model was rst applied to the task easily achieving of the art performance on multiple datasets rush et al

the model has been extended to instead use recurrent neural network as decoder chopra et al

the model was further tended to use a full rnn encoder decoder work and further enhancements through lexical and statistical features nallapati et al

the current state of the art performance is achieved by selectively encoding words as a process of ing salient information zhou et al

neural abstractive summarization models have also been explored to summarize longer ments
word extraction models have been ously explored performing worse than sentence extraction models cheng and lapata
erarchical attention based recurrent neural works have also been applied to the task owing to the idea that there are multiple sentences in a ument nallapati et al

finally based models were proposed to enable models to traverse the text content and grasp the overall meaning chen et al

the current state the art performance is achieved by a graph based attentional neural model considering the key tors of document summarization such as saliency uency and novelty tan et al

table dataset statistics
previous studies on the summarization tasks have only used entities in the preprocessing stage to anonymize the dataset nallapati et al
and to mitigate out of vocabulary problems tan et al

linked entities for summarization are still not properly explored and we are the rst to use linked entities to improve the performance of the summarizer
experimental settings datasets we use two widely used tion datasets with different text lengths
first we use the annotated english gigaword dataset as used in rush et al

this dataset receives the rst sentence of a news article as input and use the headline title as the gold standard mary
since the development dataset is large we randomly selected pairs as our development dataset
we use the same held out test dataset used in rush et al
for comparison
second we use the cnn dataset released in hermann et al

this dataset receives the full news cle as input and use the human generated multiple sentence highlight as the gold standard summary
the original dataset has been modied and processed specically for the document rization task nallapati et al

in addition to the previously provided datasets we extract linked entities using ceccarelli et al
an open source els that links text snippets found in a given text to entities contained in wikipedia
we use the default recommended parameters stated in the website
we summarize the statistics of both datasets in table
implementation for both datasets we further reduce the size of the input output and entity cabularies to at most k as suggested in see et al
and replace less frequent words to
isti
cnr
unk
we use pennington et al
and pre trained tors to initialize our word and entity vectors
for grus we set the state size to
for cnn we set h with feature maps respectively
for rm attention k is tuned by culating the perplexity of the model starting with smaller values i
e
k


and stopping when the perplexity of the model comes worse than the previous model
our liminary tuning showed that for gigaword dataset and k for cnn dataset are the best choices
we use dropout srivastava et al
on all non linear connections with a dropout rate of

we set the batch sizes of gigaword and cnn datasets to and respectively
training is done via stochastic gradient descent over ed mini batches with the adadelta update rule with constraint hinton et al
of
we perform early stopping using a subset of the given development dataset
we use beam search of size to generate the summary
baselines for the gigaword dataset we pare our models with the following abstractive baselines rush et al

is an rnn sequence to sequence model with lexical and statistical features in the encoder luong nmt luong et al

in gigaword dataset where the texts are short our best model achieves a ble performance with the current state of the art
in cnn dataset where the texts are longer our best model outperforms all the previous models
we emphasize that t module is easily attachable to better models and we expect t to improve model gold base

table human evaluations on the gigaword dataset
bold faced values are the best while red colored values are the worst among the values in the evaluation metric
their performance as well
overall t achieves a signicant improvement over the baseline model base with at least points increase in the gigaword dataset and points increase in the cnn dataset
in fact all variants of t gain improvements over the baseline plying that leveraging on linked entities improves the performance of the summarizer
among the model variants the cnn based encoder with lective disambiguation and rm attention performs the best
automatic evaluation on the gigaword dataset shows that the cnn and rnn variants of t have similar performance
to break the tie between both models we also conduct man evaluation on the gigaword dataset
we struct two annotators to read the input sentence and rank the competing summaries from rst to last according to their relevance and uency the original summary gold and from models base c and
we then compute i the proportion of every ing of each model and the mean rank of each model
the results are reported in table
the model with the best mean rank is then by and followed by gold base respectively
we also perform anova and post hoc tukey tests to show that the cnn ant is signicantly p
better than the rnn variant and the base model
the rnn variant does not perform as well as the cnn variant contrary to the automatic rouge evaluation above
terestingly the cnn variant produces better but with no signicant difference summaries than the gold summaries
we posit that this is due to the fact that the article title does not correspond to the summary of the rst sentence
selective disambiguation of entities we show the effectiveness of the selective disambiguation gate d in selecting which entities to disambiguate or not
table shows a total of four different amples of two entities with the highest lowest values
in the rst example sentence
tains the entity united states and is linked with the country entity of the same name however the correct linked entity should be united states davis cup team and therefore is given a high d value
on the other hand sentence
is linked correctly to the country united states and thus is given a low d value

the second example vides a similar scenario where sentence
is linked to the entity gold but should be linked to the entity gold medal
sentence
is linked correctly to the chemical element
hence the mer case received a high value d while the latter case received a low d value
entities as summary topic finally we provide one sample for each dataset in table for case study comparing our nal model that uses rm attention a variant that uses soft attention and the baseline model base
we also show the attention weights of the rm and soft models
first in the gigaword example we nd three the base model generated a servations
less informative summary not mentioning ico state and rst edition
second the soft model produced a factually wrong summary ing that guadalajara is a mexican state while actually it is a city
third the rm model is able to solve the problem by focusing only on the ve most important entities eliminating possible noise such as unk and less crucial entities such as country club
we can also see the ness of the selective disambiguation in this ple where the entity u
s
state is corrected to mean the entity mexican state which becomes relevant and is therefore selected
in the cnn example we also nd that the line model generated a very erroneous summary
we argue that this is because the length of the put text is long and the decoder is not guided as to which topics it should focus on
the soft model generated a much better summary however it cuses on the wrong topics specically on iran s nuclear program making the summary less eral
a quick read of the original article tells us that the main topic of the article is all about the two political parties arguing over the deal with iran
however the entity nuclear appeared a lot in the article which makes the soft model wrongly focus on the nuclear entity
the rm model produced the more relevant summary focusing on the original gold baseline entities soft firm original gold baseline soft firm western mexico will host the rst edition of the dollar ochoa invitation tournament on nov

conclusion we proposed to leverage on linked entities to prove the performance of sequence to sequence models on neural abstractive summarization task

we duced t a module that is easily attachable to any model using an encoder decoder framework
t applies linked entities into the summarizer by encoding the entities with tive disambiguation and pooling them into one summary topic vector with rm attention nism
we showed that by applying t to a basic sequence to sequence model we achieve ca nt improvements over the base model and sequently achieve a comparable performance with more complex summarization models
