implicit sensitive text summarization based on data conveyed by connectives henda chorfi ouertani information technology department college of computer and information sciences king saud university riyadh saudi arabia abstract so far and trying to reach human capabilities research in automatic summarization has been based on hypothesis that are both enabling and limiting
some of these limitations are how to take into account and reflect in the generated summary the implicit information conveyed in the text the author intention the reader intention the context influence the general world knowledge
thus if we want machines to mimic human abilities then they will need access to this same large variety of knowledge
the implicit is affecting the orientation and the argumentation of the text and consequently its summary
most of text summarizers ts are processing as compressing the initial data and they necessarily suffer from information loss
ts are focusing on features of the text only not on what the author intended or why the reader is reading the text
in this paper we address this problem and we present a system focusing on acquiring knowledge that is implicit
we principally spotlight the implicit information conveyed by the argumentative connectives such as but even yet
and their effect on the summary

introduction nowadays text summarization has become widely used on the internet
users of text summarization are countless
they can be simple internet surfers searching for different news learners looking for specific educational materials or scientists exploring particular publications text summarization can help those users identify in a short time by reducing a large amount of information to a summary which documents are most relevant to their needs
but there is widespread agreement that summarization that reduces a large volume of information to a summary preserving only the most essential items the human summarization is the process that given a document one tries to understand interpret abstract it and finally generate a new document as its summary
is a very hard process
indeed so far and trying to reach human capabilities research in automatic summarization has been based on hypothesis that are both enabling and limiting
some of these limitations are how to take into account and reflect in the generated summary the implicit information conveyed in the text the author intention the reader intention the context influence the general world knowledge


thus if we want machines to mimic human abilities then they will need access to this same large variety of knowledge
most of text summarizers ts are processing as compressing the initial data and they necessarily suffer from information loss
ts are focusing on features of the text only not on what the author intended or why the reader is reading the text
thus a ts system must identify important parts and preserve them
in this paper we will focus on acquiring knowledge that is implicit in the data and how to preserve it when generating the summary
the system we present generate argumentative text based on the implicit stored data conveyed by the argumentative connectives such as nevertheless therefore but little a little


when those connectives appear in sentences they impose constraints on the argumentative movement
this movement is based on gradual rules of inference denoted by topoi the paper is organized as follows in section we give an overview of the state of the art on text summarization
section reports on the theory of argumentation within language awl on which is based our implicit extractor
in section we describe our system architecture
in conclusion we summarize the contributions of this paper and introduce future research directions

text summarization a
types of summarizers text summarization is now an established field of natural researchers and language processing attracting many developers
we can distinguish two types of summarizers based on the volume of text to be summarized sds is performed for a single if single document summarization summarization text document then it is called as the single document text summarization mutli document summarization mds if the summary is to be created for multiple text documents then text it summarization the multi document is called as b
summarization techniques techniques may vary depending on the summarization type
when considering the single document summarization we can cite the most important techniques sentences extracting this technique relies on trivial features of sentences such as word frequency presence of keywords and sentence position or a combination of such features

identification of the relevant information permitting to generate a textual summary from the facts that need to be included
however when dealing with multi document summarization we can talk about extractive summarization involves assigning scores to some units e

sentences paragraphs of the documents and extracting those with highest scores
technique this abstractive summarization technique usually needs information fusion sentence compression and reformulation
this iii
how connectives are affecting sentence orientation a
introduction in order to show the importance of the connective on the orientation of the sentence and on its general meaning we used lsa tool
colorado
to compare two apparently same sentences
lsa is a theory and a method for extracting and representing the contextual usage meaning of words by statistical computation
lsa measures of similarity are considered highly correlated with human meaning similarities among words and texts
moreover it successfully imitates human word selection and category judgments
example let us consider the two following sentences the weather is beautiful but i have to work i have to work but the weather is beautiful with lsa the two sentences will be represented with the same semantic vectors fig

because for lsa the words like i to but are ignored and the word order is not take into account
utterance articulators such as nevertheless therefore but little a little


when those articulators appear in utterances they impose on constraints on the argumentative movement
this movement is based on gradual rules of inference denoted by topoi
according is an argumentative rule shared by a given community which need have no more members than the speaker and the hearer
topoi are the guarantors of the passage from the argument to the conclusion
topoi are used to license the move from an argument to a conclusion
to and a topos a topos singular of topoi is presented as general in the sense that the speaker implicates that the topos holds for other situations
it is not particular for the situation where it is used
presented as shared in the sense that the speaker considers that the is accepted at least by the audience
gradual
the canonical two argumentative scales the argument antecedent and the conclusion consequent
form of includes topos the each scale is marked on plus or on minus from which the next topical forms are concluded p p p and p
if we believe p we necessarily believe p and in the same way for p p to illustrate the presentation above let us consider the the weather is beautiful but i have to work
the antecedent uses a such as weather is beautiful plus we want to go the conclusion uses a topos such as i have a work to do minus i go
the use of but in the utterance influences its argumentative orientation and the all utterance orientation will be the orientation of the conclusion
let us now consider together the two sentences of according to the awl the two sentences have opposite argumentative orientations
fig

comparison of
colorado
two sentences similarity comparison but we agree that the two sentences argue to two different conclusions
so it is definitely the impact of ignoring the connective but
b
argumentation within language theory the argumentation within language theory awl has been concerned with the analysis of the argumentative from indeed for the sentence if the antecedent uses topos like beautiful weather and the conclusion uses topos like work then the presence of but imposes that the sentence have the argumentative orientation of the conclusion i
e
outing
however for the sentence and with the same reasoning its argumentative orientation is outing to end this illustration we note the importance of but in the sense that it imposes the argumentative orientation of the sentence
this importance of connectives was already www

org p a g e revealed by different works on natural language process such as in interclausal connectives carry meaning they connect textual meanings at both local and global levels and they mark discourse continuity and discontinuity both in the text and as inferred by the reader connectives can shape the actual meaning of the text they can also serve as efficient markers for instructions in the communicative process established between writer and reader
after this short outline on the theory of the argumentation within language in the next section we give a description of the architecture of an argumentative single document summarizer asds
iv
system architecture this section gives an overview of the asds architecture and describes the functions of its various components
the global architecture is represented in figure
it is composed of three layers of software the data pre processor the constraints generator and the summary generator
fig

asds architecture the pre processing layer aims at extracting connective language elements
asds uses gate a natural processing system
the generator constraints layer generate constraints based on the connectives constraints and the topos base
it permits to annotate the relevant sentences in the text
in our work we consider the sentence as the basic extraction unit
the connective constraints determine the type of argumentative relation between the argument and the conclusion whether an argument conclusion relation or argument anti argument the base is used to link arguments to conclusions
this base allows two arguments across scales since a topos is gradual as discussed above
the comparison of we notice that the proposed summarization is focused on single document texts where argumentation takes an important to filter sentence place
the summary generator aims according to the constraints predetermined by the constraints generator

identify all sentences of the document d
calculate sentences score with respect to their importance for the overall understanding of the text
this ranking is based on key words and connectives
sentences with connectives are weighted contrary to other key words are determined by their frequency in the sentences
document
a word sentence matrix is generated where the column represents the sentences and the row represents the words
words with maximum frequency are considered as key words
calculate the score for each sentence using a formula using the key words weight and connectives weight
sn

wn ww cw score where cw is the weight of connectives and ww is the weight of key words
rank the sentences in the decreasing order of calculated scores
apply connectives constraints on sentences including connectives to generate conclusions
top ranked sentences and generated conclusions are combined in sequence as document summary
v
future work in the present work we showed the role of connectives in argumentative texts when dealing with the orientation of the whole text
the analysis of these connectives indicates the existence of specific values intentionally assigned to them by the writer named topoi
as future work we plan to investigate the topoi base
many works need to be conducted especially how this base will be initialized and how it will be updated
we would like to continue the implementation of asds to apply our approach
moreover choosing argumentative texts to be used as input to our system needs further investigation
vi
conclusion in this paper we showed the role of connectives in argumentative texts when dealing with the orientation of the whole text
the analysis of these connectives indicates the existence of specific values intentionally assigned to them by the writer
for example but was shown to be functioning in sentence to impose constraints on the conclusion intended by the writer

different roles for these connectives in the construction of summaries of argumentative texts
in this context we present the architecture of asds an argumentative single document summarizer
asds is based on topoi which are gradual rules of inference
topoi are the guarantors of the passage from the argument to the conclusion
