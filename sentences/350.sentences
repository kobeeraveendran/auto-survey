edu abstract amongst the best means to summarize is lighting
in this paper we aim to generate mary highlights to be overlaid on the original documents to make it easier for readers to sift through a large amount of text
the method lows summaries to be understood in context to prevent a summarizer from distorting the inal meaning of which abstractive ers usually fall short
in particular we present a new method to produce self contained lights that are understandable on their own to avoid confusion
our method combines minantal point processes and deep ized representations to identify an optimal set of sub sentence segments that are both tant and non redundant to form summary lights
to demonstrate the exibility and eling power of our method we conduct sive experiments on summarization datasets
our analysis provides evidence that ing is a promising avenue of research towards future summarization
introduction a summary is reliable only if it is true to original
abstractive summarizers are considered to be less reliable despite their impressive performance on benchmark datasets because they can hallucinate facts and struggle to keep the original meanings tact kryscinski et al

original document and summary highlights afghan opium kills people every year worldwide more than any other drug and the opiate heroin kills ve times as many people in nato countries each year than the eight year total of nato troops killed in afghan combat the united nations said wednesday
about million people around the world use heroin opium or morphine fueling a billion market for the drug and also fueling terrorism and insurgencies


drug money is funding insurgencies in central asia which has huge energy reserves costa said


europe and russia together consume just under half of the heroin coming out of afghanistan the united nations concluded and iran is by far the single largest consumer of afghan opium
table an example of sub sentence highlights overlaid on the original document the highlights are self contained
the characteristics of summary highlights are saliency i

highlights must give the main points of the documents and non redundancy suggesting that redundant content should not appear in a mary nenkova and mckeown
importantly a highlighted text should be self contained i
e
derstandable on its own without the need for cic information from surrounding context
table provides an example of sub sentence highlights
in contrast new jersey is located in hardly tutes a good highlight because the information it contains is incomplete and may confuse readers
to date there has not been any unied framework to account for all these characteristics to generate highlights
we overcome the challenge by fying self contained sub sentence segments from the documents then combining determinantal point processes and deep contextualized representations to produce highlights
determinantal point process belongs to a class of optimization methods that have had considerable success in summarizing text and video kulesza and taskar gong et al
sharghi et al

it selects a diverse subset from a ground set of items where an item is a candidate text segment in the context of generating summary highlights
an item is characterized by a quality score that dicates the salience of the segment and a diversity t c o l c
s c v
v i x r a score that models pairwise repulsion suggesting that two segments carrying similar meaning can not both be included in the summary to avoid dancy
the quality and diversity decomposition of dpp allows it to identify an optimal subset from a collection of candidate segments
we study sub sentence segments as they strike a balance between the quality and amount of lights
whole sentences often contain excessive or unwanted details keywords are succinct but less informative
we conjecture that sub sentence ments can be identied from a document similar to salient objects are identied from an image ing bounding boxes girshick et al

to best estimate the size of segments we present a novel method to overgenerate a rich set of contained partially overlapping sub sentence ments from any sentence based on contextualized representations yang et al
devlin et al
then leverage determinantal point processes to identify an essential subset based on saliency and non redundancy criteria
our contributions of this work are summarized as follows
we propose to generate sub sentence summary highlights to be overlaid on source documents to enable users to quickly navigate through content
comparing to keywords or whole sentences sentence segments allow us to attain a good ance between quality and amount of highlights
importantly sub sentence segments are designed to be self contained and for which we introduce a new algorithm based on deep contextual sentations to obtain self contained text segments
all candidate segments are fed to tal point processes to identify an optimal subset containing informative non redundant and contained sub sentence highlights
we perform experiments on benchmark rization datasets to demonstrate the exibility and modeling power of our approach
our ysis provides further evidence that highlighting offers a promising avenue of research

determining the most appropriate textual unit for highlighting however has been an understudied problem
extractive summarization selects whole sentences from documents a sentence can tain to words on average kamigaito et al

keyphrases containing two to three words are much less informative hasan and ng
neither are ideal solutions
there is a rising need for other forms of highlighting and we explore sentence highlights that strike a balance between the amount and quality of emphasized content
it is best for highlighted segments to remain contained
in fact multiple partially overlapping and self contained segments can exist in a sentence as illustrated in table
identifying self contained segments has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies

spala et al

arumae et al
propose to align human abstracts and source cles to create ground truth highlight annotations
importantly and distinguishing our work from lier literature we make a rst attempt to generate self contained highlights drawing on the successes of deep contextualized representations and their extraordinary ability of encoding syntactic ture clark et al
hewitt and manning
we next discuss our method in greater detail
our method we present a new method to identify self contained segments then select important and non redundant segments to form a summary as text fragments taining incomplete and disorganized information are hardly successful summary highlights

self contained segments a self contained segment is in a sense a miniature sentence
any text segment containing incomplete or ungrammatical constructions is ble to humans
table presents examples of contained and non self contained segments
since its very inception vladutz the concept of semantically self contained segment has not been sufciently examined in the literature and lacks an universal denition
we assume in this paper that a self contained segment shall conform to certain syntactic validity constraints and there exists only weak dependencies between words that belong to the segment and those do not
the automatic identication of self contained segments requires more than segmentation or ing sentences into tree structures dozat and ning
self contained segments do not sarily correspond to constituents of the tree and ther there is no guarantee that tree constituents are self contained
in this paper we dene a segment to be a consecutive sequence of words excluding segments formed by concatenating non adjacent words from consideration
we perform exhaustive search to analyze every segment of a given sentence to determine if it is self contained or not
let


xn be a document sentence
we present a method to estimate whether an trary segment j of the sentence is semantically self contained or not
our method is inspired by figure the xlnet architecture with two stream attention mechanism is leveraged to estimate whether a segment is contained or not
a self contained segment is assumed to be preceded and followed by end of sentence markers eos
xlnet yang et al
that introduces a novel architecture with two stream attention mechanism for autoregressive language modeling
pretrained contextualized representations such as bert and xlnet have demonstrated remarkable success on language understanding tasks
we expect the sentations to encode the syntactic validity of ments as similar ndings are seen in recent tural probings hewitt and manning
we hypothesize that a self contained segment similar to a miniature sentence can be preceded and followed by end of sentence eos markers without sacricing grammatical correctness
we follow the convention of clark et al
to ne end of sentence markers eos to include ods and commas
our method inserts hypothetical tokens xs and xe to the beginning and end tions of a segment then constructs ized representations for these positions denoted by pstart and pend based on which we estimate how likely xs is an end of sentence marker similarly for
their average probability indicates self containedness
a higher score of j suggests xi has a higher likelihood of being self contained
pstart pstart it is important to induce contextualized tations for the augmented segment without using the content of hypothetical tokens xs and xe
we leverage xlnet with two stream attention anism for this purpose as illustrated in figure
for the k th position start end of the l th l layer a content stream builds representation h masked two stream attentionmasked two stream streamquery stream figure dpp selects a set of summary segments marked yellow based on the quality and pairwise dissimilarity of segments
by attending to all tokens of the segment whereas a query stream builds representation g taneously without incorporating the content of the current token xk following the equations given low
our method builds on the pretrained xlnet model without ne tuning
it relies on two stream attention to construct deep contextualized tations pstart and pend respectively for the beginning and end positions
l h h l g g kv h kv h i i our method is the rst attempt to extract tically self contained segments from whole tences
segments that do not resemble miniature sentences will be given low probabilities by the method
e

closed and hundreds of ights have been is scored low not only because an end sentence marker rarely occurs after have been but also the syntactic structure of the segment does not resemble that of a well formed sentence
we split a sentence at punctuation and extract a number of segments from each sentence chunk
a segment is discarded if its start or end probability is lower than the upper quartile value indicating an inappropriate start or end point
the ing segments are ordered according to the average probability
this process produces a collection of self contained and partially overlapping segments from a set of documents
next we assess the formativeness of the segments and leverage dpp to identify a subset to form the summary highlights

segment selection with dpp we employ the modeling framework proposed by cho et al
for modeling determinantal point processes
dpp kulesza and taskar denes a probability measure p over all subsets of a ground set containing a collection of n segments y n
the probability of an tive summary containing a subset of the segments y y is dened by eq
where det is the determinant of a matrix l rnn is a positive semi denite matrix and lij indicates the tion between segments i and j ly is a submatrix of l containing only entries indexed by elements in y i is the identity matrix
this denition gests that the probability of a summary l is proportional to the determinant of ly
l i log p y i n a decomposition exists for the l ensemble trix lij sij qj where qi is a quality score of the i th segment and sij is a pairwise ilarity score between segments i and j
if q and s are available can be computed using eq

estimating the pairwise similarity s is trivial we refer the reader to cho et al
for details
in this paper we present a inverted pyramid method to estimate the quality of segments q
the quality model is parameterized by thus the l ensemble is parameterized the same denoted by for the i th instance of the dataset
y i represents the ground truth summary eq

the model is timized by maximizing the log likelihood where parameters are learned during training
as trated in figure dpp allows us to identify a set of salient and non redundant summary segments
inverted pyramid we describe a classier to dict if a segment of text is summary worthy or not according to the inverted pyramid principle
it is a way of front loading a story so that the reader can get the most important information rst
e

the most newsworthy information such as who what when where
heads the article followed by portant details and nally other general and ground information
the inverted pyramid explains the common observation that lead baselines ing of the rst few sentences of an article perform strongly in the news domain

contained segments from sentence aself contained segments from sentence bquality our classier assigns a high score to a segment if its content is relevant to the lead paragraph and a low score if its content overlaps with the bottom paragraph of a news article which usually contains trivial details
importantly the classier is trained using cnn dm see et al
rather than any multi document summarization data
during training we obtain the ground truth mary of each article
a summary sentence is paired with the lead paragraph of the article that contains the sentences to form a positive instance and similarly with sentences to form a tive instance
if a summary sentence appears as is in the top or bottom paragraph we exclude the tence from the paragraph to avoid overtting the classier
at test time the classier learns to distill the essential content of the segment and assigns a high score to it if its content is similar to the lead paragraph indicating the segment is relevant and summary worthy
for each instance we obtain deep contextualized representation for it using the bert architecture where a segment and a lead or bottom paragraph is used as the input and the top layer hidden vector of the cls token is extracted as the representation
it is fed to a feedforward a dropout and a softmax layer to predict a binary label for the segment
once the model is trained we apply it to a segment and its lead paragraph to produce a vector which is used as part of the features for computing q
dpp training
we obtain feature representations for the i th segment by concatenating the previous vector and a number of surface features extracted for segment i
the features include the length and position of the segment within a document the sine similarity between the segment and document tf idf vectors kulesza and taskar
we abstain from using sophisticated features to avoid model overtting
the feature parameters are to be learned during dpp training
dpp is trained on multi document tion data by maximizing log likelihood

our task is to generate a summary of less than words from a set of news documents where a summary contains a set of selected text segments
there are four human reference summaries for each document set created by nist evaluators
a system summary is evaluated against human reference summaries using rouge lin where and r respectively measure the overlap of unigrams bigrams and skip bigrams with a maximum gap of words between system and reference summaries

the maximum sequence length of the model is tokens and the batch size is set to
we use the adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of a warm up period of steps corresponding to of the training data and linear decay after that

ground truth segments our dpp framework is fully supervised and truth summary segments are required for training the dpp
in an ideal scenario we would have man annotators to label the ground truth summary segments for each document set
it is akin to label bounding boxes for objects which allows an object detector to be trained on millions of training ples girshick et al

nonetheless human notation is tedious expensive and time consuming
we can not afford to have human annotators to label a large number of segments
we introduce an approximation method instead
first we greedily select a set of summary sentences from a document set that achieve the highest score with human reference summaries
secondly for every summary sentence we identify a single segment from a collection of over generated and self contained segments
such that the lected attains the highest f score with human summaries
such segments are labelled as positive
this two step process allows for easy generation of ground truth summary segments

lexrank erkan and radev is a graph based approach estimating tence importance based on eigenvector centrality
all of these methods extract whole sentences rather than segments from a set of documents

map fabbri et al
introduces an end to end hierarchical attention model to generate abstracts from multi document inputs
we explore two variants of our proposed method called hl xlnetsegs and hl treesegs focusing on highlighting summary segments
the former lizes xlnet to extract a set of partially overlapping segments from a sentence the latter decomposes a sentence constituent parse tree into subtrees and duc tac words per xlnet segment xlnet segments per sentence total segments per document set summary segments per document set words per tree segment tree segments per sentence total segments per document set summary segments per document set











table statistics of text segments generated by xlnet and the constituent parse tree method on duc tac datasets
collect text segments governed by the subtrees
an illustration is shown in figure
constituent parse trees are obtained using the stanford parser ning et al

in both cases the segments are passed to dpp which identies a set of important and non redundant segments as highlights
as shown in tables and we nd both ods to perform competitively with state of the art extractive and abstractive systems while producing summary segments with simpler structure
our xlnetsegs method achieves the highest scores on and it performs comparable to other tems on
it is important to note that ing a sentence into smaller segments dramatically increases the search space making it a challenging task to accurately identify summary segments yet extracting segments remains necessary as whole sentences may contain excessive and unwanted tails
the degree of difculty involved in ing sub sentence highlights is thus beyond that of sentence selection
a similar nding is reported by cheng and lapata
table presents a direct comparison of xlnet and tree segments on duc and tac datasets
we nd that xlnet segments are more concise than preliminary experiment comparing the quality er against that of cho et al
shows that our method obtains signicantly better classication accuracy vs
when evaluated on the cnn dm test set with balanced positive negative examples
with a new and improved ity classier we expect the current results to surpass that of running the cho et al

table example text segments produced by the xlnet rithm
each segment is judged by ve human evaluators on a scale of worst to best and we report their average scores
human evaluation suggests that text segments generated by our model demonstrate a high degree of self containedness

self containedness we perform further analysis to investigate the tiveness of our method on generating self contained segments

it is impractical to create a standard by asking human annotators to judge all available sentence segments as the number of ments is polynomial in sentence length
instead we perform post hoc evaluation on segments erated by our xlnet algorithm which are used as input to dpp
we sample topics from extract sentences from each document for a tal of sentences and system generated segments
a human annotator is given the original sentence and its segments and asked to score each segment on a likert scale of worst to best for self containedness
a likert scale is necessary to accommodate potentially ambiguous cases
we employ human annotators to judge each segment their average scores are reported in table
we observe that of segments have an average score of have a score and receive the full score
the human annotators are able to achieve a moderate level of agreement
the standard deviation of their scores is
of the segments have their majority score agreed by three or more annotators
table presents example segments and their human assessment scores more in supplementary
while our summary highlights figure absolute position of the whole sentence among all segments sorted by xlnet scores of self containedness
tree segments
a tree segment contains tokens on average while an xlnet segment contains
tokens on
both methods produce a large number of candidate segments ranging from to segments per document set with only to ground truth summary segments per document set
the small ratio poses a substantial challenge for dpp
not only must it identify salient content but it has to accurately identify the segments worthy of being included in the summary
in table we show example highlights produced by both ods more examples are in supplementary
segments generated by xlnet are sorted ing to their scores of self containedness
in table we provide examples of segments and their scores
the higher the score the more likely the segment resembles a miniature sentence
we are particularly interested in understanding where the original sentence is placed according to xlnet scores results are shown in figure
we observe that in of the cases the original sentence is placed among the candidates suggesting the effectiveness of the xlnet model
as segments are shorter and occur more often in natural language texts it is possible that they are considered more self contained than the original sentence
segments extracted from subtrees are sorted by the depth of tree nodes
the higher nodes are mative constituents denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses hwa
an important caveat of the tree segments is their lack of coverage
e

people died is a valid self contained segment but it does not belong to a tree constituent as seen in figure
given that drawback we focus on segments created by xlnet in our experiments
propositions from a given sentence is beyond the scope of this paper as proposition structures given by openie banko et al
or props stanovsky et al
are often not consecutive segments of text
instead they are presented as relation tuples or directed graphs
highlighting the proposition structures can cause hundreds of small text chunks to be highlighted in the documents which may result in undesirable visual effects
have been evaluated using both standard automatic metrics for assessing the informativeness of the summary and human assessment for judging the well formedness of individual segments we hope to explore other methods in future work ing human evaluation of highlights for the entire document set
the task is nontrivial
it requires a well designed intuitive graphical user interface for evaluators to read through all source documents and their accompanying summaries highlights hadad
our method constitutes the nary step of generating summary highlights
this form of summarization allows readers to grasp the main points while remaining succinct and ble offering a promising avenue of research
conclusion we make a rst attempt to create sub sentence mary highlights that are understandable and require minimum information from the surrounding text
highlighting is important to help readers sift through a large amount of texts and quickly grasp the main points
we describe a novel ogy to generate a rich set of self contained ments from the documents then use tal point processes to identify summary highlights
the method can be extended to other text genres such as public policies to aid reader comprehension which will be our future work to explore

highlighting helps readers quickly skim through a large amount of text to grasp the main points
we observe that the net segments are better than those obtained using the subtree method not only can they aid reader comprehension but they are also self contained and more concise
further we show example text ments produced by our xlnet algorithm panied by their scores of self containedness judged by ve human evaluators whose average scores are reported
results of human evaluation suggest that text segments produced by our model demonstrate a high degree of self containedness
human abstract exxon and mobil discuss combining business operations
a possible exxon mobil merger would reunite parts of standard oil broken up by the supreme court in
low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world s largest oil company
as exxon mobil merger talks continue stocks of both companies surge
the merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue
antitrust lawyers industry analysts and government ofcials say a merger would require divestitures
a mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work but notes that his company s stock would go up
extractive summary the boards of exxon corp
and mobil corp
are expected to meet tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world s largest oil company a source close to the negotiations said friday
exxon and mobil the nation s two largest oil companies conrmed friday that they were discussing a possible merger and antitrust lawyers industry analysts and government ofcials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth
the reported talks between exxon whose annual revenue exceeds that of general electric co
and mobil the no

oil company came as oil prices sank to their lowest in almost years
highlighting tree segments whether or not the talks between exxon and mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination america s economic history is already being rewritten
the boards of exxon corp
and mobil corp
are expected to meet tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world s largest oil company a source close to the negotiations said friday
exxon corp
and mobil corp
have held discussions about combining their business operations a person involved in the talks said wednesday
news that exxon and mobil two giants in the energy patch were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue
shares of exxon the biggest u
s
oil company rose
or
percent to

some analysts said that if the two giants reached an agreement it was likely to be in the form of a takeover by exxon of mobil
exxon was then known as standard oil of new jersey and mobil consisted of two companies standard oil of new york and vacuum oil
which is why mobil and exxon are considering combining into the world s largest oil company
highlighting xlnet segments whether or not the talks between exxon and mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination america s economic history is already being rewritten
still it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving protable big oil to either merge as british petroleum and amoco have already agreed to do or at least to consider the prospect as exxon and mobil are doing
oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between exxon and mobil on a merger that would create the world s largest oil company
although the companies only conrmed that they were discussing the possibility of a merger a person close to the discussions said the boards of both exxon and mobil were expected to meet tuesday to consider an agreement
analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies which employ people
they said the transaction would probably be an exchange of mobil shares for exxon shares
but this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon
the merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on lucio noto the chairman president and chief executive of mobil to nd new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects protable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices
if there is a reason this merger might get extra attention it will be because exxon and mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the clinton administration s or the european union s positions on global warming
