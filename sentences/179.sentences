reddy virginia tech in the past few years neural abstractive text summarization with sequence to sequence models have gained a lot of popularity
many interesting techniques have been proposed to improve models making them capable of handling different challenges such as saliency fluency and human readability and generate high quality summaries
generally speaking most of these techniques differ in one of these three categories network structure parameter inference and decoding generation
there are also other concerns such as efficiency and parallelism for training a model
in this paper we provide a comprehensive literature survey on different models for abstractive text summarization from the viewpoint of network structures training strategies and summary generation algorithms
several models were first proposed for language modeling and generation tasks such as machine translation and later applied to abstractive text summarization
hence we also provide a brief review of these models
as part of this survey we also develop an open source library namely neural abstractive text summarizer nats toolkit for the abstractive text summarization
an extensive set of experiments have been conducted on the widely used cnn daily mail dataset to examine the effectiveness of several different neural network components

having such short summaries the text content can be retrieved processed and digested effectively and efficiently
generally speaking there are two ways to perform text rization extractive and abstractive
a method is considered to be extractive if words phrases and sentences in the summaries are selected from the source articles
they are relatively simple and can produce grammatically correct sentences
the generated maries usually persist salient information of source articles and have a good performance w

t
human written summaries
on the other hand abstractive text summarization has attracted much attention since it is capable of generating novel words using language generation models conditioned on representation of source documents
thus they have a strong potential of producing high quality summaries that are verbally innovative and can also easily incorporate external knowledge
in this category many deep neural network based models have achieved better performance in terms of the commonly used evaluation measures such as rouge score compared to traditional extractive approaches
in this paper we ily focus on the recent advances of recurrent neural network rnn based sequence to sequence models for the task of abstractive text summarization

rnn based models and pointer generator network models see fig
have been successfully applied to a variety of natural language processing nlp tasks such as machine translation headline generation text summarization and speech recognition
inspired by the success of neural machine translation nmt rush et al
first introduced a neural attention model with an attention based encoder and a neural network language model nnlm decoder to the abstractive sentence summarization task which has achieved a significant performance improvement over conventional methods
chopra et al
further extended this model by replacing the feed forward nnlm with a recurrent neural network rnn
the model is also equipped with a convolutional attention based encoder and a rnn elman or lstm decoder and outperforms other state of the art models on commonly used benchmark datasets i
e
the gigaword corpus
nallapati et al
introduced several novel elements to the rnn encoder decoder architecture to address critical problems in the abstractive text summarization including using the following i feature rich encoder to capture keywords a switching generator pointer to model out of vocabulary oov words and the hierarchical attention to capture hierarchical document structures
they also established benchmarks for these models on a cnn daily mail dataset which consists of pairs of news articles and multi sentence highlights summaries
before this dataset was introduced many abstractive text summarization models have concentrated on compressing short documents to single sentence summaries
for the task of summarizing long documents into multi sentence summaries these models have several shortcomings they can not accurately reproduce the salient information of source documents
they can not efficiently handle oov words
they tend to suffer from and sentence level repetitions and generating unnatural summaries
to tackle the first two challenges see et al
proposed a pointer generator network that implicitly combines the abstraction with the extraction
this pointer generator architecture can copy words from source texts via a pointer and generate novel words from a vocabulary via a generator
with the pointing copying mechanism factual information can be reproduced accurately and oov words can also be taken care in the summaries
many subsequent studies that achieved state of the art performance have also demonstrated the effectiveness of the pointing copying mechanism
the third problem has been addressed by the coverage mechanism intra temporal and intra decoder attention mechanisms and some other heuristic approaches like forcing a decoder to never output the same trigram more than once during testing

neural abstractive text summarization with sequence to sequence models
training strategies there are two other non trivial issues with the current framework i
e
exposure bias and inconsistency of training and testing measurements
based on the neural bilistic language model models are usually trained by maximizing the likelihood of ground truth tokens given their previous ground truth tokens and hidden states teacher forcing algorithm see fig

however at testing time see fig
previous ground truth tokens are unknown and they are replaced with tokens generated by the model itself
since the generated tokens have never been exposed to the decoder during training the decoding error can accumulate quickly during the sequence generation
this is known as exposure bias
the other issue is the mismatch of measurements
performance of models is usually estimated with non differentiable evaluation metrics such as rouge and bleu scores which are inconsistent with the log likelihood function cross entropy loss used in the training phase
these problems are alleviated by the curriculum learning and reinforcement learning rl approaches


training with curriculum and reinforcement learning approaches
bengio et al
proposed a curriculum learning approach known as scheduled sampling to slowly change the input of the decoder from ground truth tokens to model generated ones
thus the proposed meta algorithm bridges the gap between training and testing
it is a practical solution for avoiding the exposure bias
ranzato et al
proposed a sequence level training algorithm called mixer mixed incremental cross entropy reinforce which consists of the cross entropy training reinforce and curriculum learning
reinforce can make use of any user defined task specific reward e

non differentiable evaluation metrics therefore combining with curriculum learning the proposed model is capable of addressing both issues of models
however reinforce suffers from the high variance of gradient estimators and instability during training
bahdanau et al
proposed an actor critic based rl method which has relatively lower variance for gradient estimators
in the actor critic method an additional critic network is trained to compute value functions given the policy from the actor network a model and the actor network is trained based on the estimated value functions assumed to be exact from the critic network
on the other hand rennie et al
introduced a self critical sequence training method scst which has a lower variance compared to reinforce and does not need the second critic network


applications to abstractive text summarization
rl algorithms for training models have achieved success in a variety of language generation tasks such as image captioning machine translation and dialogue generation
specific to the abstractive text summarization lin et al
introduced a coarse to fine attention framework for the purpose of summarizing long documents
their model parameters were learned with reinforce algorithm
zhang et al
used reinforce algorithm and the curriculum learning strategy for the sentence simplification task
paulus et al
first applied the self critic policy gradient algorithm to training their model with the copying mechanism and obtained the state of the art performance in terms of rouge scores
they proposed a mixed objective function that combines the rl loss with the traditional cross entropy loss
thus their method can both leverage the non differentiable evaluation metrics and improve the readability
celikyilmaz et al
introduced a novel deep communicating agents method for abstractive summarization where they also adopted the rl loss in their objective function
pasunuru et al
applied the self critic policy gradient algorithm to train the pointer generator network
they also introduced two novel rewards i
e
saliency and entailment rewards in addition to rouge metric to keep the generated summaries salient and logically entailed
li et al
proposed a training framework based on the actor critic method where the actor network is an attention based model and the critic network consists of a maximum likelihood estimator and a global summary quality estimator that is used to distinguish acm trans

in their model they used an advantage actor critic algorithm to optimize the sentence extractor for a better extraction strategy
keneshloo et al
conducted a comprehensive summary of various rl methods and their applications in training models for different nlp tasks
they also implemented these rl algorithms in an open source library

beyond rnn based models most of the prevalent models that have attained state of the art performance for sequence modeling and language generation tasks are rnn especially long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru based encoder decoder models
standard rnn models are difficult to train due to the vanishing and exploding gradients problems
lstm is a solution for vanishing gradients problem but still does not address the exploding gradients issue
this issue is recently solved using a gradient norm clipping strategy
another critical problem of rnn based models is the computation constraint for long sequences due to their inherent sequential dependence nature
in other words the current hidden state in a rnn is a function of previous hidden states
because of such dependence rnn can not be parallelized within a sequence along the time step dimension see fig
during training and evaluation and hence training them becomes major challenge for long sequences due to the computation time and memory constraints of gpus
recently it has been found that the convolutional neural network cnn based decoder models have the potential to alleviate the aforementioned problem since they have better performance in terms of the following three considerations
a model can be parallelized during training and evaluation
the computational complexity of the model is linear with respect to the length of sequences
the model has short paths between pairs of input and output tokens so that it can propagate gradient signals more efficiently
kalchbrenner et al
introduced a bytenet model which adopts the one dimensional convolutional neural network of fixed depth to both the encoder and the decoder
the decoder cnn is stacked on top of the hidden representation of the encoder cnn which ensures a shorter path between input and output
the proposed bytenet model has achieved state of the art performance on a character level machine translation task with parallelism and linear time computational complexity
bradbury et al
proposed a quasi recurrent neural network qrnn encoder decoder architecture where both encoder and decoder are composed of convolutional layers and so called dynamic average pooling layers
the convolutional layers allow computations to be completely parallel across both mini batches and sequence time step dimensions while they require less amount of time compared with computation demands for lstm despite the sequential dependence still presents in the pooling layers
this framework has demonstrated to be effective by outperforming lstm based models on a character level machine translation task with a significantly higher computational speed
recently gehring et al
attempted to build cnn based models and apply them to large scale benchmark datasets for sequence modeling
in the authors proposed a convolutional encoder model in which the encoder is composed of a succession of convolutional layers and demonstrated its strong performance for machine translation
they further constructed a convolutional architecture by replacing the lstm decoder with a cnn decoder and bringing in several novel elements including gated linear units and multi step attention
the model also enables computations of all network elements parallelized thus training and decoding can be much faster than the rnn models
it also achieved competitive performance acm trans

an overall taxonomy of topics on models for neural abstractive text summarization
on several machine translation benchmark datasets
more rencently model has been applied to the abstractive document summarization and outperforms the pointer generator network on the cnn daily mail dataset
vaswani et al
constructed a novel network architecture called transformer which only depends on feed forward networks and a multi head attention mechanism
it has achieved superior performance in machine translation task with significantly less training time
currently large transformers which are pre trained on a massive text corpus with self supervised objectives have achieved superior results in a variety of downstream nlp tasks such as machine understanding question answering and abstractive text summarization
zhang et al
demonstrated that their pre trained encoder decoder model can outperform previous state of the art results on several datasets by fine tuning with limited supervised examples which shows that pre trained models are promising candidates in zero shot and low resource summarization tasks

other studies so far we primarily focused on the pointer generator network training neural networks with rl algorithms cnn based architectures and transformers
there are many other studies that aim to improve the performance of rnn models for the task of abstractive text summarization from different perspectives and broaden their applications


network structure and attention
the first way to boost the performance of models is to design better network structures
zhou et al
introduced an information filter namely a selective gate network between the encoder and decoder
this model can control the information flow from the encoder to the decoder via constructing a second level representation of the source texts with the gate network
zeng et al
introduced a read again mechanism to improve the quality of the representations of the source texts
tan et al
built a graph ranking model upon a hierarchical encoder decoder framework which enables the model to capture the salient information of the source documents and generate accurate fluent and non redundant summaries
xia et al
proposed a deliberation network that passes the decoding process multiple times liberation process to polish the sequences generated by the previous decoding process
li et al
incorporated a sequence of variational auto encoders into the decoder to capture the latent structure of the generated summaries


extraction abstraction
another way to improve the abstractive text summarization is to make use of the salient information from the extraction process
hsu et al
proposed a unified acm trans

framework that takes advantage of both extractive and abstractive summarization using a novel attention mechanism which is a combination of the sentence level attention based on the extractive summarization and the word level attention based on the pointer generator network inspired by the intuition that words in less attended sentences should have lower attention scores
chen et al
introduced a multi step procedure namely compression paraphrase for abstractive summarization which first extracts salient sentences from documents and then rewrites them in order to get final summaries
li et al
introduced a guiding generation model where the keywords in source texts is first retrieved with an extractive model
then a guide network is applied to encode them to obtain the key information representations that will guide the summary generation process
long documents
compared to short articles and texts with moderate lengths there are many

challenges that arise in long documents such as difficulty in capturing the salient information
nallapati et al
proposed a hierarchical attention model to capture hierarchical structures of long documents
to make models scale up to very long sequences ling et al
introduced a coarse to fine attention mechanism which hierarchically reads and attends long documents a document is split into many chunks of texts

by stochastically selecting chunks of texts during training this approach can scale linearly with the number of chunks instead of the number of tokens
cohan et al
proposed a discourse aware attention model which has a similar idea to that of a hierarchical attention model
their model was applied to two large scale datasets of scientific papers i
e
arxiv and pubmed datasets
tan et al
introduced a graph based attention model which is built upon a hierarchical encoder decoder framework where the pagerank algorithm was used to calculate saliency scores of sentences


multi task learning
multi task learning has become a promising research direction for this problem since it allows models to handle different tasks
pasunuru et al
introduced a multi task learning framework which incorporates knowledge from an entailment generation task into the abstractive text summarization task by sharing decoder parameters
they further proposed a novel framework that is composed of two auxiliary tasks i
e
question generation and entailment generation to improve their model for capturing the saliency and entailment for the abstractive text summarization
in their model different tasks share several encoder decoder and attention layers
mccann et al
introduced a natural language decathlon a challenge that spans ten different tasks including question answering machine translation summarization and so on
they also proposed a multitask question answering network that can jointly learn all tasks without task specific modules or parameters since all tasks are mapped to the same framework of question answering over a given context


beam search
beam search algorithms have been commonly used in the decoding of different language generation tasks
however the generated candidate sequences are usually lacking in diversity
in other words top k candidates are nearly identical where k is size of a beam
li et al
replaced the log likelihood objective function in the neural probabilistic language model with maximum mutual information mmi in their neural conversation models to remedy the problem
this idea has also been applied to neural machine translation nmt to model the bi directional dependency of source and target texts
they further proposed a simple yet fast decoding algorithm that can generate diverse candidates and has shown performance improvement on the abstractive text summarization task
vijayakumar et al
proposed generating diverse outputs by optimizing for a diversity augmented objective function
their method referred to as diverse beam search dbs algorithm has been applied to image captioning machine translation and visual question generation tasks

introduced a algorithm that first uses dbs to generate summaries and then picks candidates according to acm trans

we will start with the basic framework and attention mechanism
then we will describe more advanced network structures that can handle different challenges in the text summarization such as repetition and out of vocabulary oov words
we will highlight various existing problems and proposed solutions

framework basics a vanilla framework for abstractive text summarization is composed of an encoder and a decoder
the encoder reads a source article denoted by


j and transforms it to hidden states he he j while the decoder takes these hidden states as the context input and outputs a summary y


yt
here xi and yj are one hot representations of the tokens in the source article and summary respectively
we use j and t to represent the number of tokens document length of the original source document and the summary respectively

encoders and decoders can be feed forward networks cnn or rnn
rnn architectures especially long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru have been most widely adopted for models
fig
shows a basic rnn model with a bi directional lstm encoder and an lstm decoder
the bi directional lstm is considered since it usually gives better document representations compared to a forward lstm
the encoder reads a sequence of input tokens and turns them into a sequences of hidden states

superscript e is the shortcut notation used to indicate that it is for the encoder
during the decoding the decoder takes the ce encoded representations of the source article i
e
hidden and cell states as the input and generates the summary
in a simple encoder decoder model encoded vectors are used to initialize hidden and cell states of the lstm decoder
for example we can initialize them as follows h e he and tanh ce j h e he j ce j he ce cd j hd here superscript d denotes the decoder and is a concatenation operator
at each decoding step we first update the hidden state hd t conditioned on the previous hidden states and input tokens i
e
hd t eyt
hereafter we will not explicitly express the cell states in the input t and output of lstm since only hidden states are passed to other parts of the model
then the vocabulary distribution can be calculated with pvocab t where pvocab t t is a vector whose dimension is the size of the vocabulary v and for each element vt of a vector v
therefore the probability of generating the target token w in the vocabulary v is denoted as pvocab t w
this lstm based encoder decoder framework was the foundation of many neural abstractive text summarization models
however there are many problems with this model
for example the encoder is not well trained via back propagation through time since the paths from encoder to the output are relatively far apart which limits the propagation of gradient signals
the accuracy and human readability of generated summaries is also very low with a lot of oov and repetitions
the rest of this section will discuss different models that were proposed in the literature to resolve these issues for producing better quality summaries

attention mechanism the attention mechanism has achieved great success and is commonly used in models for different natural language processing nlp tasks such as machine translation image captioning and neural abstractive text summarization

final hidden and cell states of the source article as input but also selectively focuses on parts of the article at each decoding step
for example suppose we want to compress the source input kylian mbappe scored two goals in four second half minutes to send france into the world cup quarter finals with a thrilling win over argentina on saturday
to its short version france beat argentina to enter quarter finals

when generating the token beat the decoder may need to attend a thrilling win than other parts of the text
this attention can be achieved by an alignment mechanism which first computes the attention distribution of the source tokens and then lets the decoder know where to attend to produce a target token
in the encoder decoder framework depicted in fig
and given all the hidden states of the encoder i
e
he he he the attention distribution e he


he j t over the source tokens is calculated as follows j and the current decoder hidden state hd he j and he j e t j t j t k where the alignment score t j has three alternatives as suggested in hd t is obtained by the content based score function which j hd t hd he j walignhd he tanh walign j hd t balign dot general concat j t and it should be noted that the number of additional parameters for dot general and concat t respectively
here represents proaches are the dimension of a vector
the general and concat are commonly used score functions in the abstractive text summarization
one of the drawbacks of dot method is that it requires he and hd to have the same dimension
with the attention distribution we can naturally define the source side context vector for the target word as j j ze t e t jhe j together with the current decoder hidden state hd wz hd t t we get the attention hidden state t hd t finally the vocabulary distribution is calculated by hd t pvocab t softmax when t the decoder hidden state hd t is updated by t eyt hd lstm hd t hd where the input is concatenation of eyt and hd t

pointing copying mechanism the pointing copying mechanism represents a class of approaches that generate target tokens by directly copying them from input sequences based on their attention weights
it can be naturally applied to the abstractive text summarization since summaries and articles can share the same vocabulary
more importantly it is capable of dealing with out of vocabulary oov words

the pointing copying mechanism into the framework
in this section we review several alternatives of this mechanism for the abstractive text summarization


pointer softmax
the basic architecture of pointer softmax is described as follows
it consists of three fundamental components short list softmax location softmax and switching network
at decoding step t a short list softmax pvocab t calculated by eq
is used to predict target tokens in the vocabulary
the location softmax gives locations of tokens that will be copied from the source article to the target yt based on attention weights e t
with these two components a switching network is designed to determine whether to predict a token from the vocabulary or copy one from the source article if it is an oov token
the switching network is a multilayer mlp with a sigmoid activation function which estimates the probability pgen t of generating tokens from the vocabulary based on the context vector ze t and hidden state hd with pgen t ws zze t ws hhd t bs where pgen t is a scalar and a a is a sigmoid activation function
the final probability of producing the target token yt is given by the concatenation of vectors pgen t pvocab t and t e t
switching generator pointer
similar to the switching network in pointer softmax

the switching generator pointer is also equipped with a switch which determines whether to generate a token from the vocabulary or point to one in the source article at each decoding step
the switch is explicitly modeled by pgen t ws zze t ws hhd t ws eeyt bs if the switch is turned on the decoder produces a word from the vocabulary with the distribution pvocab t see eq

otherwise the decoder generates a pointer based on the attention distribution t see eq
i
e
pj arg maxj


j e e t j where pj is the position of the token in the source article
when a pointer is activated embedding of the pointed token ex j will be used as an input for the next decoding step


copynet
copynet has a differentiable network architecture and can be easily trained in an end to end manner
in this framework the probability of generating a target token is a combination of the probabilities of two modes i
e
generate mode and copy mode
first copynet represents unique tokens in the vocabulary and source sequence by v and x respectively and builds an extended vocabulary vext v x unk
then the vocabulary distribution over the extended vocabulary is calculated by p vext yt pc yt acm trans

pointer generator network
pointer generator network also has a differentiable network architecture see fig

similar to copynet the vocabulary distribution over an extended vocabulary vext is calculated by p pgen t pgen t pc yt where pgen t is obtained by eq

vocabulary distribution and attention distribution pc yt are defined as follows pvocab t yt v unk otherwise pc yt j yt e t j yt x otherwise the pointer generator network has been used as the base model for many abstractive text summarization models see table and
finally it should be noted that pgen t in copynet and pointer generator network can be viewed as a soft switch to choose between generation and copying which is different from hard switch i
e

repetition handling one of the critical challenges for attention based models is that the generated sequences have repetitions since the attention mechanism tends to ignore the past alignment information
for summarization and headline generation tasks model generated summaries suffer from both word level and sentence level repetitions
the latter is specific to summaries which consist of several sentences such as those in cnn daily mail dataset and newsroom dataset
in this section we review several approaches that have been proposed to overcome the repetition problem


temporal attention
temporal attention method was originally proposed to deal with the attention deficiency problem in neural machine translation nmt
nallapati et al
have found that it can also overcome the problem of repetition when generating multi sentence summaries since it prevents the model from attending the same parts of a source article by tracking the past attention weights
more formally given the attention score t j in eq
we can first define a temporal attention score as then the attention distribution and context vector see eq
are calculated with exp t j exp s e t j exp s e j otherwise stemp t j if t temp t j stemp t j k stemp t k ze t temp t j he
j it can be seen from eq
that at each decoding step the input tokens which have been highly attended will have a lower attention score via the normalization in time dimension
as a result the decoder will not repeatedly attend the same part of the source article

intra decoder attention
intra decoder attention is another technique to handle the

repetition problem for long sequence generations
compared to the regular attention based models it allows a decoder to not only attend tokens in a source article but also keep track of the previously decoded tokens in a summary so that the decoder will not repeatedly produce the same information
t can be calculated in the same manner for t intra decoder attention scores denoted by sd as the attention score t j
then the attention weight for each token is expressed as t t t k with attention distribution we can calculate the decoder side context vector by taking linear combination of the decoder hidden states i
e
hd
the decoder side and encoder side context vector will be both used to calculate the vocabulary distribution
t as zd t d t hd

coverage
the coverage model was first proposed for the nmt task to address the problems of the standard attention mechanism which tends to ignore the past alignment information
recently see et al
introduced the coverage mechanism to the abstractive text summarization task
in their model they first defined a coverage vector ue t as the sum of attention distributions of the previous decoding steps i
e
ue e t j
thus it contains the accumulated t attention information on each token in the source article during the previous decoding steps
the coverage vector will then be used as an additional input to calculate the attention score j t j tanh walign j hd ue t balign as a result the attention at current decoding time step is aware of the attention during the previous decoding steps
moreover they defined a novel coverage loss to ensure that the decoder does not repeatedly attend the same locations when generating multi sentence summaries
here the coverage loss is defined as covlosst e t j ue t j j which is upper bounded by


distraction
the coverage mechanism has also been used in known as distraction for the document summarization task
in addition to the distraction mechanism over the attention they also proposed a distraction mechanism over the encoder context vectors
both mechanisms are used to prevent the model from attending certain regions of the source article repeatedly
formally


ze given the context vector at current decoding step ze see eq
the distracted context vector ze dist is defined by ze dist ze j j where both wdist z and whist z are diagonal parameter matrices
t and all historical context vectors ze ze t whist zze t t
improving encoded representations although lstm and bi directional lstm have been commonly used in the models for the abstractive text summarization representations of the source articles are still believed to be sub optimal
in this section we review some approaches that aim to improve the encoding process

neural abstractive text summarization with sequence to sequence models selective encoding
the selective encoding model was proposed for the abstractive

sentence summarization task
built upon an attention based encoder decoder framework it introduces a selective gate network into the encoder for the purpose of distilling salient information from source articles
a second layer representation namely distilled representation of a source article is constructed over the representation of the first lstm layer a bi directional gru encoder in this work

formally the distilled representation of each token in the source article is defined as he sel j where gatesel denotes the selective gate for token xj and is calculated as follows gatesel he j gatesel j wsel hhe j wsel senhe sen bsel he j where he he
the distilled representations are then used for the decoding
such a gate network can control information flow from an encoder to a decoder and can also select salient information therefore it boosts the performance of the sentence summarization task
sen

read again encoding
intuitively read again mechanism is motivated by human readers who read an article several times before writing a summary
to simulate this cognitive process a read again encoder reads a source article twice and outputs two level representations
in the first read an lstm encodes tokens and the article as respectively
in the second read we use another lstm to encode the source text based on the outputs of the first read
formally the encoder hidden state of the second read


is updated by and sen j j j the hidden states generation
j


j ex j j sen of the second read will be passed into decoders for summary j
improving decoder

embedding weight sharing
sharing the embedding weights with the decoder is a practical approach that can boost the performance since it allows us to reuse the semantic and syntactic information in an embedding matrix during summary generation
suppose the embedding matrix is represented by wemb we can formulate the matrix used in the summary generation see eq
as wproj
by sharing model weights the number of emb parameters is significantly less than a standard model since the number of parameters for wproj is t while that for is t where represents the dimension of vector h and denotes size of the vocabulary


deep recurrent generative decoder drgd
conventional encoder decoder models calculate hidden states and attention weights in an entirely deterministic fashion which limits the capability of representations and results in low quality summaries
incorporating variational auto encoders vaes into the encoder decoder framework provides a practical solution for this problem
inspired by the variational rnn proposed in to model the highly structured sequential data li et al
introduced a model with drgd that aims to capture latent structure information of summaries and improve the summarization quality
this model employs gru as the basic recurrent model for both encoder and decoder
however to be consistent with this survey paper we will explain their ideas using lstm instead
there are two lstm layers to calculate the decoder hidden state is updated by t

finally the decoder hidden state is obtained by t where hd is also referred to as the deterministic hidden state
vae is incorporated into the decoder to capture latent structure information of summaries which is represented by a multivariate gaussian distribution

the details of vae and its derivations can be found in
in drgd vae is incorporated into the decoder of a model more recent works have also used vae in the attention layer and for the sentence compression task

summarizing long document compared to sentence summarization the abstractive summarization for very long documents has been relatively less investigated
recently attention based models with pointing copying mechanism have shown their power in summarizing long documents with and tokens
however performance improvement primarily attributes to copying and repetition redundancy avoiding techniques
for very long documents we need to consider several important factors to generate high quality summaries such as saliency i
e
significance fluency coherence and novelty
usually models combined with the beam search decoding algorithm can generate fluent and human readable sentences
in this section we review models that aim to improve the performance of long document summarization from the perspective of saliency
models for long document summarization usually consists of an encoder with a chical architecture which is used to capture the hierarchical structure of the source documents
the top level salient information includes the important sentences chunks of texts sections and paragraphs while the lower level salient information represents keywords
hereafter we will use the term chunk to represent the top level information
the hierarchical encoder first encodes tokens in a chunk for the chunk representation and then encodes ent chunks in a document for the document representation
in this paper we only consider the single layer forward for both word and chunk encoders
suppose the hidden states of chunk i and word j in this chunk are represented by hchk hidden state hd at decoding step t we can calculate word level attention weight wd t wd t i j l wd t chk t i chk t t with wd t by chk t i i j i j kl attention weight chk t and schk i i i i hd t can be calculated using eq

in this section we will review four where both alignment scores swd t i j k hd at the same time we can also calculate chunk level and hwd i j i for the current decoder

neural abstractive text summarization with sequence to sequence models different models that are based on the hierarchical encoder for the task of long document text summarization


hierarchical attention
the intuition behind a hierarchical attention is that words in less important chunks should be less attended
therefore with chunk level attention distribution chk t and word level attention distribution wd we first calculate re scaled word level attention distribution by scale t i j chk t wd i j i l chk t wd t kl i j scale t i j this re scaled attention will then be used to calculate the context vector using eq
i
e
ze t
it should be noted that such hierarchical attention framework is different from the hierarchical attention network proposed in where the chunk representation is obtained using zwd t i instead of the last hidden state of the word encoder
i i j j wd t hwd i j

discourse aware attention
the idea of the discourse aware attention is similar to that of the hierarchical attention giving eq

the main difference between these two attention models is that the re scaled attention distribution in the discourse aware attention is calculated by scale t i j chk t swd t i i j l chk t swd t kl k where swd t i j is an alignment score instead of an attention weight


coarse to fine attention
the coarse to fine attention was proposed for tational efficiency
similar to the hierarchical attention the proposed model also has both chunk level attention and word level attention
however instead of using word level hidden states in all chunks for calculating the context vector the attention method first samples a chunk i from the chunk level attention distribution and then calculates the context vector using j scale t ze
at the test time the stochastic sampling of the chunks will be replaced by a t i j greedy search
hwd i j

graph based attention
the aforementioned hierarchical attention mechanism itly captures the chunk level salient information where the importance of a chunk is determined solely by its attention weight
in contrast the graph based attention framework allows us to late the saliency scores explicitly using the pagerank algorithm on a graph whose vertices and edges are chunks of texts and their similarities respectively
formally at the decoding time step t saliency scores for all input chunks are obtained by f t w t where adj adjacent matrix w adj similarity of chunks is calculated by w adj
dadj is a diagonal i j matrix with its i equal to the sum of the ith column of w adj
is a damping factor
the i wparhchk hchk j vector t is defined as t where t is a topic see for more details
t i t otherwise finally the graph based attention distribution over a chunk can be obtained by chk t i t t i t i t where i on chunks that rank higher than the previous decoding step i

extraction abstraction extractive summarization approaches usually show a better performance comparing to the tive approaches especially with respect to rouge measures
one of the advantages of the extractive approaches is that they can summarize source articles by extracting salient snippets and sentences directly from these documents while abstractive approaches rely on word level attention mechanism to determine the most relevant words to the target words at each decoding step
in this section we review several studies that have attempted to improve the performance of the abstractive summarization by combining them with extractive models

extractor loss and inconsistency loss

the inconsistency loss is expressed as linc where k t is the set of the top k attended words and t is the total number of words in a summary
intuitively the inconsistency loss is used to ensure that the sentence level attentions in the extractive model and word level attentions in the abstractive model are consistent with each other
in other words when word level attention weights are high the corresponding sentence level attention weights should also be high

reinforce selected sentence rewriting
most models introduced in this survey are built upon the encoder decoder framework in which the encoder reads source articles and turns them into vector representations and the decoder takes the encoded vectors as input and generates summaries
unlike these models the reinforce selected sentence rewriting model consists of two models
the first one is an extractive model extractor which is designed to extract salient sentences from a source article while the second is an abstractive model abstractor which paraphrases and compresses the extracted sentences into a short summary
the abstractor network is a standard attention based model with the copying mechanism for handling oov words
for the extractor network an encoder first uses a cnn to encode tokens and obtains representations of sentences and then it uses an lstm to encode the sentences and represent a source document
with the sentence level representations the decoder another lstm is designed to recurrently extract salient sentences from the document using the pointing mechanism
this model has achieved the state of the art performance on cnn daily mail dataset and was demonstrated to be computationally more efficient than the pointer generator network
training strategies in this section we review different strategies to train the models for abstractive text summarization
as discussed in there are two categories of training methodologies i
e
level and sequence level training
the commonly used teacher forcing algorithm and entropy training belong to the first category while different rl based algorithms fall into the second
we now discuss the basic ideas of different training algorithms and their applications to models for the text summarization
a comprehensive survey of deep rl for models can be found in

word level training the word level training for language models represents methodologies that try to optimize tions of the next token
for example in the abstractive text summarization given a source article a model generates a summary y with the probability p where represents model parameters e

weights w and bias
in a neural language model this probability can be expanded to p p t t t where each multiplier p t known as likelihood is a conditional probability of the next token yt given all previous ones denoted by y t



intuitively the text generation process can be described as follows
starting with a special token sos start of sequence the model generates a token yt at a time t with the probability p t pvocab t yt
this token can be obtained by a sampling method or a greedy search i
e
yt arg maxyt pvocab t see fig

the generated token will then be fed into the next decoding step
the generation is stopped when the model outputs eos end of sequence token or when the length reaches a user defined maximum threshold
in this section we review different approaches for learning model parameters i
e

we will start with the commonly used end to end training approach i
e
cross entropy training and then move on to two different methods for avoiding the problem of exposure bias

e
log p log p yt y t t t which is equivalent to minimizing the cross entropy xent loss lossxent log p
we show this training strategy in fig

the algorithm is also known as the teacher forcing algorithm
during training it uses observed tokens ground truth as input and aims to improve the probability of the next observed token at each decoding step
however during testing it relies on predicted tokens from the previous decoding step
this is the major difference between training and testing see fig
and
since the predicted tokens may not be the observed ones this discrepancy will be accumulated over time and thus yields summaries that are very different from ground truth summaries
this problem is known as exposure bias
scheduled sampling
scheduled sampling algorithm also known as data as

demonstrator dad has been proposed to solve the exposure bias problem
as shown in fig
during training the input at each decoding step comes from a sampler which can decide whether it is a model generated token yt from the last step or an observed token yt from training data
the sampling is based on a bernoulli distribution pi yt y yt where pdad is the probability of using a token from training data and i y yt is a binary indicator function
in the scheduled sampling algorithm pdad is an annealing scheduling function and decreases with training time from to
as suggested by bengio et al
scheduling function can take different forms e

dad pdad k k linear decay exponential decay inverse sigmoid decay where k is training step and is a parameter that guarantees pdad
this strategy is often referred to as a curriculum learning algorithm
the main intuition behind this algorithm is that at the beginning stage a model with random parameters can not generates relevant correct tokens therefore a decoder takes ground truth tokens from training data as input
as the training proceeds the model gradually reduces the probability of using ground truth tokens
by the end of the training the model assumes that it has been well trained and can generate reasonable tokens thus the decoder can completely rely on its own predictions

end to end backprop
this algorithm is another method that exposes a model to its own predictions during training
at each decoding step it still uses xent to train the model parameters
however the input is neither a ground truth token nor a model generated token
instead it is a fusion of top k tokens from the last decoding step where k is a hyper parameter



ysampk more specifically the model first samples the top k tokens denoted as t from the vocabulary distribution pvocab t
then it can re scale their probabilities as follows t t psamp t ysampi t pvocab t ysampi t sampj j pvocab t y t and obtain a vector in the embedding space by esamp t
this fused vector will be served as the input for the next decoding step
it should be noted that also makes use of dad in practice where a sampler is used to determine whether to take fused vectors or embeddings of ground truth tokens as input

sequence level training the sequence level training with deep rl algorithms has recently received a lot of popularity in the area of neural abstractive text summarization due to its ability to incorporate any user defined metrics including non differentiable rouge scores to train neural networks
in this section we review several different policy gradient algorithms that have been used to train abstractive text summarization models
for actor critic algorithms and related work the readers are encouraged to go through these publications
in rl setting generating a sequence of tokens in a summary can be considered as a sequential decision making process where an encoder decoder model is viewed as an agent which first reads a source article and initializes its internal state hidden and cell states for lstm
at the decoding step t it updates the state and takes an action y t v i
e
picking a token from the vocabulary according to a policy p t
here the vocabulary is viewed as an action space
by the end of the decoding it will produce a sequence of actions y t and observe a reward t which is usually rouge scores in the context of text summarization
then rl algorithms will be used to update the agent by comparing the action sequence based on current policy with the optimal action sequence i
e
the ground truth summary
in this section we will start with the commonly used reinforce for training models
then we will introduce the mixer algorithm which can improve the convergence rate and stability of the training and the self critic sequence training approach which shows low variance for the gradient estimator

with the gradient the model parameters are updated by t will be back propagated to every node of the computational graph via the l where is the learning rate
as it can be seen from eq
computing gradient requires us to sample all sequences which is not practical due to the presence of possible number of sequences
instead reinforce approximates the expectation with a single sample thus the gradient is expressed as follows l log p t t t t t one of the problems associated with this method is high variance of gradient estimator because it makes use of only one sample to train the model
a practical solution to alleviate this problem is introducing a baseline reward denoted by to the gradient i

in this way it will not t b

in practice the gradient with the baseline is approximated with t log p t p y t l t b log p t t t t better ways of sampling a sequence and different approaches to calculate the baseline can be found in


mixer
training models using reinforce may suffer from slow convergence and can also fail due to the large action space and poor initialization which refers to randomly initialize parameters and start with random policy
to alleviate this problem ranzato et al
modified reinforce by incorporating the idea of curriculum learning strategy and proposed a mixer algorithm
in this algorithm they first trained a model for n to ensure rl starts with a better policy
afterwards in each batch and for each sequence they used the cross entropy loss for the first t steps and reinforce for the remaining steps where is an integer number
training was continued for another n where n is also an integer number
then they increased reinforce steps to and continued training for another n

this process will repeat until the whole sequence is trained by reinforce
this algorithm has shown a better performance for greedy generation compared to xent dad and in the task of abstractive text summarization
self critic sequence training scst
the main idea of scst is to use

testing time inference algorithm as the baseline function in reinforce
suppose the greedy search see fig
is used to sample actions during testing
then at each training iteration the model generates two action sequences in which the first one y greedy is from greedy search while the second one y t
according to scst baseline is defined as reward greedy to the first sequence
therefore the gradient of the loss function in scst is expressed as t is sampled from a distribution p t t l t greedy t log p t t according to eq

the scst has shown low variance and can be effectively optimized with mini batch sgd compared to reinforce
it has also been demonstrated to be effective in improving the performance of models for the task of abstractive text summarization
in this work the authors used the following rl loss to train their model
lrl t greedy t log p t t although the model performs better than those trained with xent in terms of rouge scores human readability of generated summaries is low
to alleviate this problem the authors also defined a mixed loss function of rl and xent i
e
lmixed lrl lxent where is a hyper parameter
the model trained with the mixed loss can achieve better human readability and rouge scores are still better than those obtained with xent
they also used scheduled sampling to reducing exposure bias in which the scheduling function is a constant pdad

we have reviewed different rnn encoder decoder architectures and training strategies in the last two sections
now we are at the position to generate summaries for given source articles
summary generation generally speaking the goal of summary generation is to find an optimal sequence y t such that y t arg max y t y log p t arg max t y log p t t t where y represents a set that contains all possible sequences summaries
however since it has elements the exact inference is intractable in practice
here v represents the output vocabulary
in this section we review the beam search algorithm and its extensions for approximating the exact inference

greedy and beam search as shown in fig
we can generate a sub optimal sequence with greedy search i

yields b b expanded fragments i

new hypotheses in which only the top b of them along with their scores are retained for the next decoding step
this procedure will be repeated until eos token is generated
in algorithm we show pseudo codes of a beam search algorithm for generating summaries with models given the beam size of b and batch size of

diversity promoting algorithms despite widespread applications beam search algorithm suffered from lacking of diversity within a beam
in other words the top b hypotheses may differ by just a couple tokens at the end of sequences which not only limits applications of summarization systems but also wastes computational resources
therefore it is important to promote the diversity of generated sequences
ippolito et al
performed an extensive analysis of different post training decoding algorithms that aim to increase the diversity during decoding
they have also shown the power of oversampling i
e
first sampling additional candidates and then filtering them to the desired number
in improving the diversity without sacrificing performance
in this section we briefly introduce some studies that aim to increase the diversity of the beam search algorithm for abstractive summarization models


maximum mutual information mmi
the mmi based methods were originally proposed for neural conversation models and then applied to other tasks such as machine translation and summarization
the basic intuition here is that a desired model should not only take into account the dependency of a target on a source but also should consider the likelihood of the source for a given target which is achieved by replacing the log likelihood of the target i
e
log p in eq
with pairwise mutual information of the source and target defined by log p y p p y
during the training model parameters are learned by maximizing mutual information
when generating sequences the objective is expressed as follows y arg max y log p y p y arg max y y log p log p y however it is obvious that calculating p y is intractable
thus several approximation methods have been proposed in the literature to alleviate this problem
these approximation method can be summarized by the following three steps train two models one for and the other for where and are the model parameters
generate a diverse n list of sequences based on
to achieve this goal the method for calculating the scores for beam search algorithm has been modified as k t k log p yt t k s beam by adding the last term k the model explicitly encourages hypotheses from different parents i
e
different k which results in more diverse results
therefore parameter is also known as the diversity rate which indicates the degree of diversity integrated into beam search algorithm
re rank n list by linearly combining and
the ranking score for each candidate in the n list is defined as follows log log where is a task specific auxiliary term
and are parameters that can be learned using minimum error rate training on the development dataset

diverse beam search dbs
dbs is another approach that aims to increase the diversity of standard beam search algorithm
it first partitions the hypotheses into g groups
then at each decoding step it sequentially performs a beam search on each group based on a dissimilarity augmented scoring function t b b log p ycand t b b t b t t


t b s cand s cand where is a parameter
t represents a diversity function which measures the dissimilarity or distance between candidate ycand t b in group and sequences in groups from to
standard beam search is applied to group
intuitively the generated sequences in different groups are very different from each other due to the penalty of diversity functions
in dbs has been combined with pointer generator network to improve the diversity of the model produced summaries



implementations and experiments apart from a comprehensive literature survey and a detailed review of different techniques for network structures training strategies and summary generations we have also developed an open source library namely nats
com nats based on rnn framework for abstractive text summarization

implementations the nats is equipped with following important features attention based framework
we implemented the attention based model shown in fig

encoder and decoder can be chosen to be either lstm or gru
the attention scores can be calculated with one of three alignment methods given in eq

pointer generator network
based on the attention based framework we implemented pointer generator network discussed in section


intra temporal attention mechanism
the temporal attention can work with all three ment methods
intra decoder attention mechanism
the alignment method for intra decoder attention is the same as that for the attention mechanism
coverage mechanism
to handle the repetition problem we implemented the coverage anism discussed in section


if coverage is switched off coverage loss will be set to
weight sharing mechanism
as discussed in section

weight sharing mechanism can boost the performance using significantly fewer parameters
beam search algorithm
we implemented an efficient beam search algorithm that can also handle the case when the batch size
unknown words replacement
similar to we implemented a heuristic unknown words replacement technique to boost the performance
theoretically a pointer generator network may generate oov words even with the copying mechanism because unk is still in the extended vocabulary
thus after the decoding is completed we manually check unk in summaries and replace them with words in source articles using attention weights
this meta algorithm can be used for any attention based model

rouge evaluations recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation rouge scores were first introduced in and have become standard metrics for evaluating abstractive text summarization models
they determine the quality of summarization by counting the number of overlapping units i

n grams word sequences and word pairs between machine generated and golden standard human written summaries
within all different rouge measures unigram bigram and rouge l longest common subsequence have been most widely used for single document abstractive summarization
in this paper different models are evaluated using pyrouge

experiments on cnn daily mail dataset in the past few years the cnn daily mail dataset has become a standard benchmark dataset used for evaluating the performance of different summarization models that can generate sentence summaries for relatively longer documents
in our experiments we systematically investigated the effects of six network components in the framework on summarization performance including i alignment methods in the attention mechanism pointing mechanism intra temporal attention iv intra decoder attention v weight sharing and vi coverage mechanism
our experimental results are shown in table
to effectively represent different models id of each model consists of a letter followed by five binary indicators corresponding to the six important components
the letters g d and c denote alignment methods general dot and concat respectively
and indicates if a component is switched on or off respectively
at first it can be clearly seen that the performance of three basic attention based models i
e
are close to each other
in these tests we still keep the oov tokens in generated summaries when performing the rouge evaluations which results in relatively lower rouge precision scores
therefore rouge f scores may be lower than those reported in the literature
comparing with and with we find that pointing mechanism significantly improves the performance of attention based models
by analyzing summaries we observed that most of the tokens are copied from source articles which results in summaries that are similar to the ones generated by the extractive
as discussed in section

another advantage of pointing mechanism is that it can effectively handle oov tokens
the remaining four components are tested upon the pointer generator network
by comparing and we see that the intra temporal attention increases almost rouge points
this might be because of its capability of reducing repetitions
however most of our models that combine intra temporal attention with concat failed during training after a few epochs
thus we did not report these results
as to intra decoder attention we observe from and that it does not boost the performance of the model before adding weight sharing mechanism
however in the case of concat the models with intra decoder attention have a better performance
weight sharing mechanism does not always boost the performance of the models according to the comparison of and
however as aforementioned models extractive models attempt to extract sentences from the source articles

experiments on newsroom and bytecup datasets we also tested nats toolkit on the newsroom dataset which was released recently
in our ments we tokenized the raw data with three different packages and generated three versions of the dataset for the task of text summarization and three versions for the task of headline generation
experimental results obtained with the models and on the released testing set are shown in table
it can be observed that performs better than on cnn daily mail data from table however achieves better rouge scores in both text summarization and headline generation tasks on newsroom dataset
finally we summarize our results for the bytecup headline generation dataset in table

conclusion and future directions being one of the most successful applications of models neural abstractive text marization has become a prominent research topic that has gained a lot of attention from both industry and academia
in this paper we provided a comprehensive survey on the recent advances of models for the task of abstractive text summarization
this work primarily focuses on the challenges associated with neural network architectures model parameter inference mechanisms and summary generation procedures and the solutions of different models and algorithms
we also provided a taxonomy of these topics and an overview of different models for the abstractive text summarization
as part of this survey we developed an open source toolkit namely nats which is equipped with several important features including attention pointing mechanism repetition handling and beam search
in our experiments we first summarized the experimental results of different models in the literature on the widely used cnn daily mail dataset
we also conducted extensive experiments on this dataset using nats to examine the effectiveness of different neural network components
finally we established benchmarks for two recently released datasets i
e
newsroom and bytecup
despite advances of models in the abstractive text summarization task there are still many research challenges that are worth pursing in the future
large transformers
these large scale models are first pre trained on massive text corpora with self supervised objectives and then fine tuned on downstream tasks
they have achieved state of the art performance on a variety of summarization benchmark datasets
in the pre trained encoder decoder model can outperform previous state of the art results on several datasets by fine tuning with limited supervised examples which shows that pre trained models are promising candidates for zero shot and low resource summarization
reinforcement learning rl
rl based training strategies can incorporate any user defined metrics including non differentiable ones as rewards to train summarization models
these metrics can be rouge bertscore or saliency and entailment rewards inferred from the natural language inference task
therefore we may improve current models with rl by leveraging external resources and characteristics of different datasets
summary generation
most based summarization models rely on beam search algorithm to generate summaries
recently based approaches have achieved success in open ended language generation since they can acm trans

neural abstractive text summarization with sequence to sequence models increase the diversity of the generated texts
it is a promising research direction that can potentially increase the novelty of the generated summaries without sacrificing their quality
datasets
based summarization models are widely trained and evaluated on news corpora
however the journalistic writing style promotes the leading paragraphs of most news articles as summaries which causes the models to favor extraction rather than abstraction
to alleviate this problem researchers have introduced several datasets from other domains
in the future many new datasets will likely be released to build better abstractive summarization systems
evaluation
most automatic evaluation protocols e

rouge and bertscore are not sufficient to evaluate the overall quality of generated summaries
we still have to access some critical features like factual correctness fluency and relevance of generated summaries by human experts
thus a future research direction along this line is building better evaluation systems that go beyond current metrics to capture the most important features which agree with humans
for example some attempts have been made for generic text generation
