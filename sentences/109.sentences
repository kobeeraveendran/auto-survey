v i x r a abstract debate summarization is one of the novel and challenging research areas in matic text summarization which has been largely unexplored
in this paper we velop a debate summarization pipeline to summarize key topics which are discussed or argued in the two opposing sides of line debates
we view that the generation of debate summaries can be achieved by clustering cluster labeling and tion
in our work we investigate two ferent clustering approaches for the eration of the summaries
in the rst proach we generate the summaries by plying purely term based clustering and cluster labeling
the second approach makes use of x means for clustering and mutual information for labeling the ters
both approaches are driven by tologies
we visualize the results using bar charts
we think that our results are a smooth entry for users aiming to ceive the rst impression about what is discussed within a debate topic containing waste number of argumentations
introduction as the number of internet users has been growing signicantly information is published and stored digitally in textual forms
online debate is one example of the information which has been sively published
as more and more debate tent increases it becomes a difcult task to easily and quickly discover key arguments that are pressed in the vast amount of debate data
matic text summarization can help users to tract or summarize those key arguments more ciently and reduce the reading time
online debate forums normally contain two sides of debates proponent and opponent
this structure gives opportunities for users to choose a stance side for a debate topic expresses their opinions to support their propositions and poses other propositions
in this paper we explore online debates which are related to the existence of global warming
a side of proponents believes in the existence of global warming and the other side the opponents says that global warming is not true
when the proponents and the opponents express their sentiments opinions and pieces of evidence to support their propositions arguments between them arise
in this paper we aim to summarize online bates about global warming
in our approach we rst extract salient sentences from the two ing sides of debates i
e
arguments published by users
next we cluster them by some sort of ilarity
for clustering we investigate two ent approaches
our rst approach is a term based clustering approach
the second approach is based on at clustering namely x means which can automatically determine the number of ters
ontologies are used as the backbone for both approaches
ontologies have been used broadly in automatic text summarization studies
ever to the best of our knowledge this approach has not yet been applied for summarizing online debates especially when our purpose is to ture arguments conversed in both opposing sides
once clusters are generated labels representing the clusters are extracted
again we follow two approaches
the rst approach is a simple one and selects as a label an ontological term that is shared by all salient sentences within the cluster
the ond labeling approach extracts such a term based on mutual information mi
the resulting ters along with their labels are visualized using bar charts
our results show that clustering with x means and label generation using mi is a better choice for the purpose of online debates rization
the rest of the paper is organized as follows
section discusses about related work in online debate summarization
the online debate data lated to the existence of global warming are rated in section
section illustrates the system structure for developing our debate summarization system
within the same section we also present our evaluation results
we conclude in
related work debate summarization is one of the novel research areas in automatic text summarization which has been largely unexplored ranade et al

amples of related work in debate summarization includes contrastive summarization tive summarization and debate stance tion
contrastive summarization is the study of generating summary for two entities and nding the difference in sentiments among them man and mcdonald
this kind of marization requires the classication of polarity in order to contrast opinions expressed in different sentiments campr and jezek paul et al

kim and zhai summarized trastive pairs of sentences by aligning positive and negative opinions on the same aspect
in this work contrastive sentence pairs were constructed based on two criteria choose sentences that represent a major sentiment orientation and the two tences should have opposite opinions on the same aspect
similarity functions were used for mining contrastive sentence pairs
then sentence pairs were used as input for generating the nal summary
the summary was aimed to help ers compare the pros and cons of mixed opinions
comparative summarization aims to nd the difference between two comparable entities so that sentiment classication may not be required campr and jezek
zhai et al
worked on comparative text mining problem which aimed to discover common topics in news articles and laptop reviews and to summarize monalities and differences in a given set of parable text collections
a probabilistic mixture model was proposed
it generates clusters of ics across all collections and in each collection of document
the model generates k collections of specic topics for each collection and k common topics across all collections
each topic is acterized by multinomial word distribution also called a unigram language model
high bility words were used as representatives of each cluster and are also included in the summary
debate stance recognition aims to detect stance of an opinion s holder in text
daran and wiebe noticed that in online bate posts people debate issues express their vorites oppose other stances and argue why their thoughts are correct
to determine positive timent about one target expressing negative timent about the other side is a key target
for instance in a debate which mobile phone is ter iphone vs blackberry people supporting iphone may give reasons to afrm why iphone is better
in addition they also express why berry is not
on the blackberry side people may also nd reasons to support their opinions and gue why the phone is unfavorable
therefore to identify stance it is important to not only consider positive and negative sentiment but also consider which target an opinion refers to
unlike these the study of ranade et al
directly tackled debate summarization problem and it is the one which is closest to our work
in that work system summaries are extracted by ranking the smallest units of debates called alogue acts das
the ranking of sentences is based on features including words in das that is co occurring in debate topic topics with ions expressed on it sentence position and tence length features
however this work does not explicitly highlight what is the key content to be summarized and how the debate summary is sented
this is different to our work
on the other hand in our work we highlight the summarization of key content in debates and visualize them to be easily accessed by users
online debate data in our earlier work we created freely available debate dataset on climate change also referred as salient sentence selection dataset sssd
each debate consists of two opposing sides agree and disagree
whereas the opinion on the agree side believes that global warming ists the disagree side opposes this opinion
in this dataset each debate comment was manually dataset can be downloaded at

tated by judgments
the aim of the annotation was to select from each comment sentences that were salient and worth for inclusion in a mary
for instance for a comment containing sentences sentences were extracted by each notator
the dataset contains debate topics with comments in total
average number of ments for a topic is comments with the imum and maximum of and comments spectively
framework to generate a bar chart representing a summary of an online debate topic we proposed a pipeline with two branches where each branch presents either a term based clustering and the term based ing method or x means based clustering and the mi labeling strategy
the ow of the pipeline is shown in figure
the system assumes an input of n comments from the agree and disagree sides
each comment consists of several sentences
we aim to select the most salient sentences from each comment cluster the salient sentences according to their content similarity generate clusters senting labels and nally visualize the results ing a bar chart summary
in the following sections we introduce each of the components and provide evaluation results

automatic salient sentence selection for the shown pipeline in figure we used an tractive automatic summarization system reported in our earlier work
there are main features dened in this system
those features include sentence position sp sentence length sl title words tt the presence of conjunctive adverbs cj cosine similarity of topic and sentences cos tps cosine similarity of climate change and sentences cos ccts cosine similarity of sentence and title words cos tts and the semantic similarity of sentence and title words cos stt using
additionally we also investigated the combination of features cb in the salient sentence selection
for a given comment the system extracts sentences from it that are deemed as salient

xqvejf
used an approach described by lin and hovy to obtain a list of topic signatures
we extract the topic tures from our dataset which is related to climate change
terms are obtained by aggregating document words from online news media coverage on climate change


evaluation we used and evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of the system summaries i
e
the selection of salient sentences
as reference summaries we used the manually generated summaries from the freely available dataset sssd
our results revealed that sentence position outperforms other features cating that the most salient sentences are always
in addition other useful key features are debate tle words feature and cosine similarity of debate title words and sentences feature
the complete set of results are shown in table

term based clustering to perform clustering we used terms extracted through ontologies
we employed the glish climapinion from the decarbonet as the background knowledge to ture climate change topics and extract from each salient sentence topical terms
to obtain clusters we grouped sentences containing the same label within the same cluster
if a sentence contained more than one term then it was assigned to several groups allowing the sentence to be soft clustered
also note terms with the same semantic meaning can be expressed differently
to address this for each label we obtained a list of its synonyms from wordnet miller
if the labels shared mon synonyms we considered they are the same labels
consequentially the sentences cally annotated with such labels were merged to the same clusters


evaluation the evaluation of the ontology based term tion has been evaluated somewhere else
by sisting of two environmental ontologies gemet general multilingual environmental thesaurus and reegle the climapinion yields great results in recognizing environmental terms in text with the precision recall and measure of

the clustering performance by determining the propriateness of documents assigned to a cluster rather than the other clusters
these documents are represented as coordinates
silhouette lates the pairwise difference in both inter cluster and intra cluster distance
we calculated an age silhouette score and reported it in table
as shown in the table the system generated ters based on the climate change terms annotated by the climapinion service
it achieved the houette score around zero similar to the work sented by wang and koopman
the pretation based on the score is the data points are assigned nearly to the decision boundaries of the clusters
especially when salient sentences tain multiple climate change topics clear ing boundaries are difcult to achieve
this cumstance indicates that such a simple clustering approach is less applicable for grouping cally similar sentences together and that the task asks for more sophisticated ways for achieving a better performance
we will discuss an alternative solution in section


term based label extraction after grouping salient sentences together the groups or clusters should be given labels which clearly reect the content in the clusters aker et al

similar to the clustering approach where we grouped salient sentences by the logical term they share we used the sharing term as the label to represent the cluster
this is based on the assumption that the climate change terms which are annotated in the sentences do already elaborate the central meaning of the clusters


evaluation in the labeling evaluation we compared the tem labels against the baseline labels
we ated the baseline labels by applying
it is a common approach in most information retrieval systems ponte and croft which consists of two main components tf and idf
in our iment tf indicates the frequency of terms occurs in a
idf presents the number clusters in which the term occurs
these components allow us to reduce common terms in the clusters and cover more discriminative terms having fairly low term frequency in the clusters
to determine the candidate labels we calculated the score for each term by the multiplication of tf and idf
the term with the top score was chosen as the cluster label
in the evaluation of cluster labels we followed the manual evaluation method presented by aker et al

we invited three participants two phd candidates and one researcher having ground in computer science to evaluate the bels
the evaluation was presented as an online form
the participants were asked to read the sentences in the given clusters and score the bels
the baseline and system labels were shown in random order
the pants were asked to answer ve point likert scale questions ranking from strongly disagree to strongly agree
the questions include i tion by reading the label i can understand it question this label is a complete phrase and question this label precisely reects the content of the sentences in cluster
along with the three questions we presented clusters with a maximum of salient sentences so that the ticipants are able to read the content prior to the labeling evaluation and a minimum of salient sentences
figure illustrates the results of the labeling evaluation
for each label as we can see from the gure in overall the quality of system labels outperforms the baseline labels
in the system labels compared to the baseline labels are more understandable with the average score of
and
respectively
wise in the system labels are more completed phrases than the baseline with the mean ence of

lastly with the average preference figure the labeling evaluation performed on the term based clustering approach
the average preference scores generated by participants on a scale strongly disagree to strongly agree scores of
in the system labels are more ecting the quality of content in the clusters than those generated by the baseline having the score of

additionally the quality of the system labels is further conrmed by a statistical icance analysis with mann whitney u test
the test reveals that signicance difference is found in the system labels m and the baseline labels m m m

x means clustering in section
we have shown that the idea of forming clustering based on shared terms results in poor clustering performance
the approach leads to too many clusters which are very close to each other
in this section we aim to overcome the problem of poor performance of the term based clustering approach and use x means pelleg and moore an extended version of k means to cluster the salient sentences selected by the summarization system
one of the benets of means is that it is able to automatically detect the number of clusters
by computing the bayesian information criterion bic scores x means cides if cluster centroids should be split
we plied ontology based vector space model approach sentences can carry more than a term it is likely measurement is performed using nltk metrics that a cluster has several climate change terms

to create vectors as the similarity inputs for means
have strong clustering structure and is more priate for the task of summarizing debate data
table average silhouette scores derived from x means clustering results number of clusters average silhouette score

label generation with mutual information to generate labels from the x means clusters we could have followed the same approach as scribed in section
namely picking up a term that is shared by all or majority of the salient tences within a cluster
we tried this however to our surprise the performance was very low pared to what we achieved in section

ertheless this helped us to draw two conclusions
first the performance in section
is high cause the labels were so selected that all salient sentences within a group shared that label
second the size of the clusters was not big so that the label had high chance to be representative of the ter
this pictures changed once the cluster size increased and also the salient sentences covered several different climate change terms
because of this selecting a label was not about just simply selecting the term that appears in all or majority of the salient sentences
we used mutual information mi to make this decision for us
mi is a prevalent feature selection approach that involves in the calculation of a utility sure c
mi quanties how much information that term t contributing to the correct tion judgment on class c manning et al

the mi formula is shown in equation where u is a random variable that holds the value
if a sentence contains term t the value of et is
erwise the et is
c is a random variable that holds the value ec
the value of ec is indicating that a sentence is in class c and it is if it is not


similarity measurement to enable x means to process the clustering a similarity needs to be dened to determine which sentences are close to each other
in the nition of our similarity measurement the matic selected salient sentences are transformed into vectors using the vector space model vsm
in the document indexing stage we employed the ontologies to automatically annotate key climate change terms in the sssd
the employment of ontology based approach benets the tion of words to vectors by help capturing vance of specic topics
we derived ca nt climate change topics
term frequency was counted for each term to generate vectors for each sentence
to generate a similarity matrix cosine similarity measure was used to calculate cosine similarity scores among the vectors
after the ilarity matrix was constructed we applied a cipal component analysis for the sionality reduction


evaluation similar to the ontology term based clustering we evaluated the results of the x means clustering ing silhouette index
results are reported in table
as shown in the table the average silhouette score is derived from the calculation based on the similarity denition obtained by the based vector space model
we achieved a high houette score of
with the total number of generated clusters
a silhouette close to
dicates good cohesion and separation of the tering results meaning that the average distance from a coordinate in a cluster to the other nates within its own cluster is less than the average distance to all coordinate in the nearest cluster
in addition when the score is close to the nates in the clusters are nearly close or on the cision boundary between two neighbouring ters
a negative silhouette score is obtained when coordinates might be assigned to wrong clusters
in other words the coordinates are very close to the neighbouring cluster rather than the nates in their own clusters rousseeuw
in our experiment we concluded that the clustering results obtained by x means clustering algorithm

to calculate the mutual information scores for candidate terms we applied the maximum hood estimation of probability as shown in tion manning et al

from the equation n refers to the counts of sentences in which its subscripts take the values of et and ec

is derived from the addition of and
n refers to the total number of sentences
in each cluster we calculated the score of each candidate term
the term with the higher mi score was selected as the cluster label for that cluster


labeling evaluation in order to evaluate the system labels generated by the results derived from x means clustering proach we applied the same evaluation procedure as well the baseline discussed in section


the results are illustrated in figure
as can be seen from the gure the average preference scores of the system outperform the baseline
in the system labels are more understandable than the baseline with the mean difference of

in the system labels more completed phrases than the baseline labels with a higher mean score of

lastly in the system labels are still ter than the baseline labels with the mean ence of

the system labels are more ingful for presenting the central meaning of the content in the clusters

visualization sanchan et al
have manually investigated various representation models for displaying or figure the labeling evaluation performed on the x means clustering approach
the average preference scores generated by participants on a scale strongly disagree to strongly agree sualizing summaries of online debates
unlike ditional summaries the debates extracts have to capture main concepts discussed in both sides and enable the reader to look at those concepts from both proponent and opponent sites
the authors proposed the chart summary which presents the clusters by bars
each bar is marked with the cluster label
in this work we adopt the chart summary for visualization purposes
an example chart summary is shown in figure
in the generation of the bars in chart summary the bars are the clusters that express related tent in both opposing sides
therefore it is portant to match clusters from the two opposing sides which express the related content
we call this approach as alignment
from the two ing sides we align the clusters based on the ter labels
the clusters sharing mutual labels are aligned
for alignment we used cosine ity over vector spaces representing the labels
the vector also contains semantically related words enriched from wordnet
clusters which have no pair will not be aligned and thus will not be sented in the chart summary
once the pairs of aligned clusters are derived we count the number of salient sentences in those clusters separately in each opposing side
those numbers represent the frequencies of the bars
after all components of a chart summary are completely generated they are exported to java for the purpose of visualizing the chart summary
figure illustrates a chart mary for the online debates data which runs on a web
figure chart summary for debate data conclusion in this paper we investigated one of the novel and challenging problems in automatic text rization of online debates and proposed a work to tackle this problem
we aimed to erate chart summaries which represent the level topics of online debates
the chart summary is composed of three main components including the bars labels and frequencies of the bars
we proposed an ontological term based driven tering and cluster labeling pipeline to guide the debate summary generation
in our approach we used an online service to automatically annotate climate change terms in salient sentences and to group related salient sentences into the same ter
for clustering we investigated two variants both making use of ontological terms
the rst a simply approach groups salient sentences by shared terms
the second approach applies means clustering
the evaluation has shown that the x means approach is a better choice for tering
we create labels to represent each ter
again here we investigated two different proaches both making use of ontological terms
the rst approach again a simply one labels each

cluster with the term shared by all members within the cluster
the second approach picks up the best term according to mutual information
the ual evaluation showed that the simple approach achieves higher results than the mi one
ever as discussed the simply approach achieved high results because of the size of the clusters and led to poor results when the size of the cluster grew which is the case with the x means ing
once the clusters and labels are generated with align the pro and contra parts and visualize the results using
in future work we plan to enrich the chart mary with additional details such as enabling the users to see example debates for each pair of ters
