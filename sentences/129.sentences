kuznetsov abstract
the article is devoted to the expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals of second multiplicity into the double series of products of standard gaussian random variables
the proof of expansion is based on the application of double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method
the results of the article can be applied to the numerical integration of ito stochastic dierential equations

introduction let f p be a complete probability space let be a nondecreasing right continous family of algebras of f and let f t be a standard m dimensional wiener stochastic process which is ft measurable for any t i


m of this process are independent
consider an ito stochastic dierential equation sde in the integral form t
we assume that the components i t ft t t xt d df
t t t t rn b rn here xt is some n dimensional stochastic process satisfying to the equation
the nonrandom functions a rn rnm guarantee the existence and uniqueness up to stochastic equivalence of a solution of the ito sde
the second integral on the right hand side of is interpreted as an ito stochastic integral
let be an n dimensional random variable which is measurable and m m denotes a mathematical expectation
we assume that and ft it is well known that one of the eective approaches to the numerical integration of ito sdes is an approach based on the taylor ito and taylor stratonovich expansions
moreover one of the most important features of such expansions is a presence in them of the so called iterated ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals which play the key role for solving the problem of numerical integration of ito sdes and have the following form are independent when t

it is well known that the mean square approximation of the iterated ito and stratonovich stochastic integrals using multiple integral sums requires signicant computational costs since this approach implies the partitioning of the integration interval t t of the iterated stochastic integrals into parts t t plays the role of an integration step in numerical methods for solving ito sdes
t is already a suciently small value since t more ecient approximation methods for the iterated stochastic integrals use fourier series and they do not require the interval t t to be subdivided into smaller parts
one such method was proposed in and elaborated in
this method which received widespread use is based on the karhunen loeve expansion of the brownian bridge process in the eigenfunctions of its covariance which form a complete orthonormal trigonometric basis in the space t
note that in the more general and eective method the so called method of generalized multiple fourier series for the mean square approximation of the iterated ito stochastic integrals was proposed
this method is based on the generalized multiple fourier series that converge in the sense of norm in hilbert space t where t k is the hypercube t t t k times and k is the multiplicity of the iterated ito stochastic integral
the method of generalized multiple fourier series was developed in



an important feature of the method of generalized multiple fourier series is that various complete orthonormal bases in the space t can be used the method proposed in admits only the trigonometric basis
hence we can state the problem of comparing the eciency of using dierent complete orthonormal bases in the space t in the context of the numerical solution of ito sdes
this problem has been solved in also see
in particular in it was shown that the optimal system of basis functions in the framework of the numerical solution of ito sdes is the system of legendre polynomials
that is why this article is devoted to the expansions of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals with multiplicity based on multiple fourier legendre series
usage of fourier series with respect to the system of legendre polynomials for approximation of iterated stochastic integrals took place for the rst time in also see
the results of see also convincingly testify that there is a doubtless relation between multiplier factor which is typical for stratonovich stochastic integral and included into the sum connecting stratonovich and ito stochastic integrals and the fact that in the point of nite discontinuity of piecewise smooth function its fourier series converges to the value
in addition in expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals several theorems on expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals were formulated and proved
as shown in these papers the nal formulas for expansions of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals are more compact than their analogues for iterated ito stochastic integrals
this paper continues the study of the relationships between generalized multiple fourier series and iterated stochastic integrals
we use the unifrom converging double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method for proof of theorem

moreover as shown below the conditions of these theorems can be weakened

the proof of theorem for the case k see based on multiple double fourier legendre series and analogous trigonometric fourier series see theorem

in this article we formulate and prove the analogue of theorem for the case k theorem see below but under the weakened conditions the functions only one time continuously dierentiable at the interval t t

sufficient conditions of uniform convergence of double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method let j


be the legendre polynomial
consider the function y dened for consider the double fourier legendre series summarized by pringsheim method and corresponding y
to the function y n m c ij y def lim n m x p x def i x c ij y c ij p
where let us consider the generalization for the case of two variables of the theorem on equiconvergence for the fourier legendre series
theorem
let y and the function d

kuznetsov is integrable on the square
moreover let y u v u y v where are bounded functions on the square then for all y the following equality is satised

t t expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals we will say that the function of k k variables f t t

for example the following theorem is correct

lemma is proved
expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals lemma and theorem imply that rectangular partial sums of the double trigonometric fourier series of the function y in the case of periodic continuation of the function y converge uniformly in the square to the function y
this means that the equality holds

main theorem theorem
suppose that is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t
moreover are continuously dierentiable functions on t t
then for the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral j t df


m t zt zt the following expansion j t
i
m
x x that converges in the mean square sence is valid where the notations are the same as in theorem
proof
let us prove the equality t zt x where is dened by the formula for k and
at that orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t
is a complete consider the auxiliary function k t k k t l t t and prove that where l and by the lagrange formula for the functions and for the functions t
at the interval min at the interval min t max t t we obtain max t k k t t t t t we have d
f
kuznetsov t t
t t t t t or t t t t t t t
t t by the lagrange formula for the functions at the interval min max we obtain the estimate t t t t t or t t
t t or t t let us show that if t or t t then the following inequality is satised t t
first consider the case t t
for this case t t
t t then and is satised
for the case t t we obtain expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals t t
t t then and also is satised
from and we have t t t t t t t t t t t or t t t or t t t t or t t t t or t t t t
from and we obtain
let t t t t t t y t t where y
then k k y y y t t t t
inequality can be rewritten in the form where y and k y k y l x y y where l and y x y
thus the function k y satises the conditions of lemma and hence for the function d
f
kuznetsov k the inequality is fullled
due to the continuous dierentiability of the functions and at the interval we have k y
in addition k c zx dydx c
properties of the function k y y thus the conditions of theorem are fullled for the function k y
note that the mentioned t t
let us expand the function k into a multiple double fourier legendre series in the square also correct for the function k t t
this series is summable by the method of rectangular sums pringsheim method i
e
k lim k t t x x zt zt t lim x x zt zt t t zt x x lim t t
moreover the convergence of the series is uniform on the rectangle t t t t for any in particular we can choose
in addition the series converges to k at any inner point of the square t t
note that theorem do not answer the question on convergence of the series on a boundary of the square t t
in obtaining we replaced the order of integrating in the second iterated integral
expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals let us substitute into
after that let us rewrite the limit on the right hand side of as two limits
let us replace with with with and with in the second limit
thus we get lim x x t t
according to the above reasoning the equality holds uniformly on the interval t t for any
additionally holds at each interior point of the interval t t
lemma
under the conditions of theorem the following limit exists where is dened by if i
e
lim n x
t zt zt the proof of lemma will be given in sect

let us x and integrate the equality at the interval t t convergence of the series we can swap the series and the integral
due to the uniform lim
t x x t taking into account lemma consider the equality for n t lim lim n t x n x zt t t zt zt lim n n x n lim x x d
f
kuznetsov where riemann integral and orthonormality of the functions for j


t
in obtaining we used the theorem on the mean value for the t t performing the passage to the limit lim in the equality we get t zt
x thus to complete the proof of theorem it is necessary to prove lemma
remark
on the basis of it can be argued that the function k belongs to the holder class with parameter in t t
hence by theorem this function can be expanded into the uniformly convergent double trigonometric fourier series on the square t t which summarized by pringsheim method
this means that theorem will remain valid if in this theorem instead of the double fourier legendre series we consider the double trigonometric fourier series
however the expansions of iterated stochastic integrals obtained by using the system of legendre polynomials are essentially simpler than their analogues obtained by using the trigonometric system of functions see sect


about some properties of legendre polynomials for further consideration we will need some well known properties of legendre polynomials the complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials in the space t looks as follows j t t pj r t t t t j


where is the legendre polynomial
it is known that the legendre polynomial is represented for example as
at the boundary points of the interval of orthogonality the legendre polynomials satisfy the following relations dxj j
pj pj where


relation of the legendre polynomial pj with derivatives of the legendre polynomials and is expressed by the following equality p p j


the recurrent relation has the form expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals j j


orthogonality of legendre polynomial to any polynomial of lesser degree we write in the following form it follows that the orthonormal on the interval legendre polynomials determined by the relation from the property

if k j if k j p j j


r it is well known that there is an estimate k j y j


where constant k does not depends on y and j
moreover pj j

kuznetsov n t t x n x n x t t t t t t n x t t zy n t x n x zy t t where are derivatives of the functions with respect to the variable see
applying the estimate and taking into account the boundedness of the functions and their derivatives we nally obtain n x n x n m dx zy dx dy expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals n n m x if n m where constants do not depend on n and m
the relation completes the proof of lemma

q another example of obvious advantage of the legendre polynomials over the trigonometric functions in the framework of the considered problem is the truncated expansion of the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral i t obtained by theorem in which instead of the double fourier legendre series is taken the double trigonometric fourier series which is acceptable according to remark q q q p x x r q

an analogue of the formula for the case of legendre polynomials is according to and the following representation where i t t t i t t q x i i i i i i p i t t t q x i i which is obviously substantially simpler than
here it is necessary to pay a special attention on the fact that the representation includes a single sum with the upper summation limit q while the representation includes the double sum with the same summation limit
in numerical simulation obviously the formula is more economical in terms of computational cost than its analogue
there is another feature that should be noted in connection with the formula
this formula was rst obtained in by the method from
as we noted in sect
the method of approximation of iterated stochastic integrals is based on the trigonometric series expansion of the brownian bridge process
so this method leads to iterated application of the operation of limit transition in contrast to theorems and in which limit transition is performed only once
this means that from the method generally speaking does not follow the mean square convergence of i t see to the stochastic integral i
the same applies to some others approximations of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals obtained in by the method see discussion in sect
for detail
t if the validity of the formula expansion of iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals m lim q i t i t where i t is dened by the formula follows from theorems and

a natural question arises if we replace f i s i


m in the functionals mentioned above will the resulting functionals converge to the original functionals from the components i s i


m of the multidimentional wiener process fs the answere to this question is negative in the general case
however in the pioneering works of wong e
and zakai m
it was shown that under the special conditions and for some types of approximations of the wiener process the answere is armative with one peculiarity the convergence takes place to the iterated stratonovich stochastic integrals and solutions of stratonovich sdes and not to iterated ito stochastic integrals and solutions of ito sdes
the piecewise linear approximation as well as the regularization by convolution relate the mentioned types of approximations of the wiener process
the above approximation of stochastic integrals and solutions of sdes is often called the wong zakai approximation

pp

moreover approximations of the wiener process that are similar to were not considered in also see theorems


therefore the proof of analogs of theorems
and
for approximations of the wiener process based on its series expansion should be carried out separately
thus the mean square convergence of the right hand side of to the iterated stratonovich stochastic integral does not follow from the results of the papers also see theorems


from the other hand theorems and from this paper can be considered as the proof of the wong zakai approximation for the iterated riemann stieltjes integrals of multiplicities to based on the approximation of the wiener process in the form of its series expansion
at that the mentioned riemann stieltjes integrals converge according to theorems and to the appropriate see and theorems stratonovich stochastic integrals
recall that is a complete orthonormal system of legendre polynomials or trigonometric functions in the space t
to illustrate the above reasoning consider two examples for the case k
