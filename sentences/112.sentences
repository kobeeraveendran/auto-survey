ca abstract the work presented in this paper attempts to evaluate and quantify the use of course relations in the context of blog summarization and compare their use to more traditional and factual texts
ically we measured the usefulness of discourse relations namely son contingency illustration attribution topic opinion and attributive for the task of text summarization from blogs
we have evaluated the effect of each relation using the tac opinion tion dataset and compared them with the results with the duc dataset
the sults show that in both textual genres tingency comparison and illustration lations provide a signicant improvement on summarization content while tion topic opinion and attributive tions do not provide a consistent and nicant improvement
these results cate that at least for summarization course relations are just as useful for formal and affective texts as for more ditional news articles
introduction it is widely accepted that in a coherent text units should not be understood in isolation but in tion with each other through discourse relations that may or may not be explicitly marked
a text is not a linear combination of textual units but a archically organized group of units placed together based on informational and intentional relations to one another
according to taboada course relations relations that hold together ferent parts i
e
proposition sentence or graph of the discourse are partly responsible for the perceived coherence of a text
for example have been relations and news applications generation in many nlp language in the sentence if you want the full vista rience you ll want a heavy system and graphics hardware and lots of memory the rst and ond clauses do not bear much meaning dently but become more meaningful when we alize that they are related through the discourse lation condition
discourse found such useful e

as natural summarization mckeown e

blair goldensohn and mckeown bosma to improve coherence and better simulate human writing
however most of these work have been developed for formal written and factual documents
text available in the social media are typically written in a more casual style are opinionated and speculative andreevskaia et al

this techniques developed for formal texts such as news articles often do not behave as well when dealing with informal documents
in particular news articles are more uniform in style and structure whereas blogs often do not exhibit a stereotypical discourse structure
as a result for blogs it is usually more difcult to identify and rank relevant units for summarization compared to news articles
because of several work have shown that discourse lations can improve the results of tion in the case of factual texts or news articles e

otterbacher et al

however to our knowledge no work has evaluated the usefulness of discourse relations for the summarization of formal and opinionated texts as those found in the social media
in this paper we consider the most frequent discourse relations found in blogs namely comparison contingency illustration tribution topic opinion and attributive and uate the effect of each relation on informal text summarization using the text analysis ence tac opinion summarization
we then compare these results to those found with the news articles of the document understanding conference duc main task
the results show that in both types of texts discourse relations seem to be as useful contingency parison and illustration relations provide a tically signicant improvement on the summary content while the attribution topic opinion and attributive relations do not provide a consistent and signicant improvement
related work on discourse relations for summarization a single relation for proposed otterbacher et al
discourse summarization the use of discourse relations for text rization is not new
most notably marcu relations used and ment parsing identication course bosma in some work e

rithm
blair goldensohn and mckeown course relations have been exploited successfully for multi document summarization
in experimentally ular showed that discourse relations can improve the coherence of multi document summaries
bosma tions can be used effectively to incorporate information for a given additional contextual summarization
question in used blair goldensohn and mckeown discourse relations for content selection and organization and automatic achieved an improvement in both cases
course relations were also used successfully by zahri and fukumoto for news rization
showed how discourse query based summaries of a however the work described above have been developed for formal well written and factual documents
most of these work show how course relations can be used in text summarization and show their overall usefulness
to the best of our knowledge our work is the rst to measure the effect of specic relations on the summarization of informal and opinionated text
tagging discourse relations to evaluate the effect of discourse relations on a large scale sentences need to be tagged ically with discourse relations
for example the sentence yesterday i stayed at home because it was raining
needs to be tagged as containing a cause relation
one sentence can convey zero or several discourse relations
for example the sentence starbucks has contributed to the larity of good tasting coffee does not contain any discourse relations of interest to us
on the other hand the sentence while i like the zillow face and agree it s an easy way to nd data i d prefer my readers used their own brain to perform a basic valuation of a property instead of relying on zestimates
contains relations of interest one comparison three illustrations and one bution

most frequent discourse relations since our work is performed within the work of blog summarization we have only sidered the discourse relations that are most ful to this application
to nd the set of the relations needed for this task we have rst manually analyzed summaries randomly lected from participating systems at the tac opinion summarization track and domly selected blogs from
in building our relation taxonomy we considered all main discourse relations listed in the omy of mann and thompson s rhetorical ture theory rst mann and thompson
these discourse relations are also considered in grimes grimes and williams predicate lists
from our corpus analysis we have identied the six most prevalent discourse relations in this blog dataset namely comparison contingency lustration attribution topic opinion and tive
the comparison contingency and tion relations are also considered by most of the work in the eld of discourse analysis such as the pdtb penn discourse treebank research group prasad et al
and the rst discourse bank research group carlson and marcu
we considered three additional classes of tions attributive attribution and topic opinion
these discourse relations are summarized in ure while a description of these relations is given below
illustration is used to provide additional mation or detail about a situation
for example

as shown in figure illustration tions can be sub divided into sub categories joint list disjoint and elaboration relations according to the rst discourse treebank carlson and marcu and the penn course treebank prasad et al

contingency provides cause condition reason or evidence for a situation result or claim
for example the meat is good because they slice it right in front of you
as shown in figure the contingency tion subsumes several more specic relations planation evidence reason cause result quence background condition hypothetical ablement and purpose relations according to the penn discourse treebank prasad et al

comparison gives a comparison and contrast among different situations
for example its forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had
the comparison relation subsumes the contrast relation according to the penn discourse bank prasad et al
and the analogy and preference relations according to the rst course treebank carlson and marcu
attributive relation provides details about an entity or an event e

mary has a pink coat

it can be used to illustrate a particular feature about a concept or an entity e

picasa makes sure your pictures are always organized

the tributive relation also included in grimes icates grimes is considered because it scribes attributes or features of an object or event and is often used in query based summarization and question answering
topic opinion we introduced topic opinion lations to represent opinions which are not pressed by reported speech
this relation can be used to express an opinion an internal feeling or belief towards an object or an event
for example cage is a wonderfully versatile actor
attribution these relations are instances of ported speech both direct and indirect which may express feelings thoughts or hopes
for ple the legendary gm chairman declared that his company would make a car for every purse and purpose

automatic discourse tagging once the manual analysis identied the most relations we tried to prevalent set of frequency by tagging them sure their tomatically within a larger corpus
only recently the hilda hernault et al
and feng and hirst discourse parser were made publicly available
both of these parsers work at the text level as opposed to the sentence level and hence currently achieve the highest tagging performance when compared feng and hirst s to the state of the art
work showed a signicant improvement on the performance of hilda by enhancing its original feature set
however at the time this research was done the only publicly available discourse parser was spade soricut and marcu which operates on individual sentences
to identify illustration contingency comparison and attribution relations we have used spade discourse parser
however we have mented this parser with three other approaches jindal and liu s approach is used to tify intra sentence comparison relations we have designed a tagger based on fei et al
s approach to identify topic opinion relations and we have proposed a new approach to tag attributive relations mithun
a tion and evaluation of these approaches can be found in mithun
by combining these approaches a sentence is tagged with all possible discourse relations that it contains

distribution of discourse relations to nd the most prevalent discourse relations for opinion summarization we have used the tac opinion summarization track input document set collection which is a subset of and the answer nuggets provided by tac as the reference summary or model summaries which had been created to evaluate participants maries at the tac opinion summarization track
the collection consists of blogs on different topics
the dataset of the model maries consists of sentences
using the discourse parsers presented in section
we computed the distribution of discourse lations within the tac opinion tion collection and the model summaries
tion contingency comparison attributive opinion and attribution are the most frequently occuring relations in our data sets
the tion is shown in table
table distribution of discourse relations in the and datasets discourse relation illustration contingency comparison attributive topic opinion attribution other none tac duc coll
model coll
model table shows that in the tac input ument set the illustration relation occurs in of the sentences while attribution is the least quently occurring relation
in this dataset other relations such as antithesis and temporal tions occur in about of the sentences and about of the sentences did not receive any lation tag
as indicated in table the tac model summaries have a similar distribution as the lection as a whole
the attributive relation seems however to be more frequent in the summaries than in the original texts
we pect that the reason for this is due to the question types of this track
to successfully generate relevant summaries that answer the questions of this track candidate sentences need to contain tributive relations
for example to answer the questions from this track why do people like casa or what features do people like about windows vista the summary needs to provide table the percentages do not add up to because a sentence may contain more than one relation
details about these entities or illustrate a particular feature about them
as a result the summary will be composed of many attributive relations since attributive relations help to model the required formation
to compare the distribution of discourse tions within more formal types of texts such as news articles we used the document ing conference duc main task input ument set collection and their associated model summaries
the duc dataset is a news cle based dataset from the aquaint corpus
the duc input document set contains news articles on different topics
the model maries were used to evaluate the duc ticipants summaries
the dataset of the model summaries contains summaries generated by the national institute of standards and ogy nist assessors with a summary length of about words
the distribution of relations in this dataset are shown in table
table shows that the most frequently ring relation in the duc document tion and in the model summaries is illustration while the attribution relation is the least frequently occurring relation
here again it is interesting to note that the distribution of the discourse relations in the document collection and in the model maries is generally comparable
the distribution of the illustration contingency and comparison relations in the duc dataset is comparable to those in the tac opinion summarization dataset
indeed table shows that illustration contingency and comparison lations occur quite frequently irrespective of the textual genre
however in contrast to the tac dataset attributive topic opinion and attribution relations occur very rarely in duc
we pect that this is mostly due to the opinionated ture of blogs
another observation is that temporal relations included in other occurred very quently in the duc dataset whereas this relation occurs rarely in the blog dataset
this is in line with our intuition that news articles present events that inherently contain temporal formation
evaluation of discourse relations to measure the usefulness of discourse relations for the summarization of informal texts we have tested the effect of each relation with four ferent summarizers blogsum mithun mead radev et al
the best scoring tem at tac and the best scoring system at duc
we have evaluated the effect of each discourse relation on the summaries ated and compared the results
let us rst describe the blogsum summarizer

blogsum blogsum is a domain independent query based extractive summarization system that uses sentential discourse relations within the work based on text schemata
the heart of sum is based on discourse relations and text schemata
blogsum works in the following way first candidate sentences are extracted and ranked using the topic and question similarity to give priority to topic and question relevant sentences
since blogsum has been designed for blogs which are opinionated in nature to rank a tence the sentence polarity e

positive negative or neutral is calculated and used for sentence ranking
to extract and rank sentences blogsum thus calculates a score for each sentence using the features shown below sentence score question similarity topic similarity subjectivity score where question similarity and topic similarity are calculated using the cosine similarity based on words tf
idf and the subjectivity score is lated using a dictionary based approach based on the mpqa
once sentences are ranked they are categorized based on the discourse tions that they convey
this step is critical because the automatic identication of discourse relations renders blogsum independent of the domain
this step also plays a key role in content selection and summary coherence as schemata are designed ing these relations
in order not to answer all questions the same way blogsum uses different schemata to erate a summary that answers specic types of questions
each schema is designed to give ority to its associated question type and tive sentences as summaries for opinionated texts are generated
each schema species the types of discourse relations and the order in which they should appear in the output summary for a ticular question type
figure shows a sample schema that is used to answer reason questions e

why do people like picasa
according to this one or more sentences containing a topic opinion or attribution relation followed by zero or many sentences containing a contingency or comparison relation followed by zero or many sentences containing a attributive relation should be used
figure a sample discourse schema used in blogsum finally the most appropriate schema is selected based on a given question type and candidate tences ll particular slots in the selected schema based on which discourse relations they contain in order to create the nal summary details of sum can be found in mithun

evaluation of discourse relations on blogs to evaluate the effect of each discourse relation for blog summarization we performed several iments
we used as a baseline the original ranked list of candidate sentences produced by blogsum before applying the discourse schemata and pared this to the blogsum generated summaries with and without each discourse relation
we used the tac opinion summarization dataset which consists of questions on topics on each topic one or two questions were asked and to relevant documents were given
for each question one summary was generated with no gards to discourse relations and two summaries were produced by blogsum one using the course tagger and the other without using the cic discourse tagger
the maximum summary length was restricted to words

the results of our evaluation are shown in bles and rouge
as the tables show blogsum s baseline is situated below the best scoring system at but much higher than the average system see ble hence it represents a fair baseline
the tables further show that using both the and rouge r metrics with the tac dataset blogsum performs better when taking discourse relations into account
indeed when ignoring discourse relations blogsum has a
and r
and misses many question relevant sentences whereas the inclusion of these relations helps to incorporate those vant sentences into the nal summary and brings in the score to
and r to

order to verify if these improvements were tistically signicant we performed a tailed test
the results of this test are indicated with the symbol in tables and
for example the baseline setup of blogsum performed cantly lower for both and r compared to blogsum with all relations
this result indicates that the use of discourse relations as a whole helps to include more question relevant sentences and improve the summary content
to ensure that the results were not specic to our summarizer we performed the same ments with two other systems the mead marizer radev et al
a publicly available and a widely used summarizer and with the output of the tac best scoring system
for mead we rst generated candidate sentences using mead then these candidate sentences were tagged using discourse relation taggers used under blogsum
then these tagged sentences were ltered using blogsum so that no sentence with a specic lation is used in summary generation for a ticular experiment
we have calculated rouge scores using the original candidate sentences erated by mead and also using the ltered date sentences
as a baseline we used the nal candidate sentences generated by mead
as a best case scenario we have passed these candidate sentences through the discourse schemata used by blogsum see section

in tables and this is referred to as mead with all relations
we have applied the same approach with the output of the tac best scoring system
in the tables best baseline refers to the original summaries generated by the tac best system and tac best with all relations refers to the summaries erated by applying discourse schemata using the summary sentences generated by the tac best system
when looking at individual relations tables and show that considering illustrations gencies and comparisons make a statistically nicant improvement in all scenarios and with all summarisers
for example if tac best does not consider illustration relations then the score decreases from
to

and
respectively
on the other hand the relations of topic opinion attribution and attributive do not consistently lead to a statistically signicant provement on rouge scores
it is interesting to note that although mal texts may not exhibit a clear discourse ture the use of individual discourse relations such as illustration contingency and comparison is nonetheless useful in the analysis of informal uments such as those found in the social media

effect of discourse relations on news to compare the results found with blogs with more formal types of texts we have performed the same experiments but this time with the duc main task dataset
in this task given a topic title and a set of relevant documents ticipants had to create an automatic summary of length words from the input documents
in the dataset there were topics and thirty teams ticipated to this shared task
table shows the cial and rouge r scores of the duc main task summarization in table duc average refers to the track

sum s performance with all discourse relations
and r
is similar to the duc average performance shown in table
and r
which is much lower than the duc best performance

however these results show that even though blogsum was signed for informal texts it still performs tively well with formal documents
tables and further show that with the news dataset the same relations have the most effect as with blogs
indeed blogsum generated summaries also et most from the contingency illustration and comparison relations and all three relations bring a statistically signicant contribution to the mary content
here again as shown in tables and we performed the same experiments with two other the mead summarizer and the output systems of the duc best system
again for the duc dataset each discourse relation has the same effect on summarization with all systems as with the blog dataset contingency illustration and comparison provide a statistically signicant improvement in content while attributive opinion and attribution do not reduce the content but do not see to bring a systematic and signicant improvement
conclusion and future work in this paper we have evaluated the effect of course relations on summarization
we have sidered the six most frequent relations in blogs namely comparison contingency illustration tribution topic opinion and attributive
first we have measured the distribution of discourse tions on blogs and on news articles and show that the prevalence of these six relations is not genre dependent
for example the relations of tration contingency and comparison occur quently in both textual genres
we have then uated the effect of these six relations on rization with the tac opinion tion dataset and the duc dataset
we have conducted these evaluations with our tion system called blogsum the tac best scoring the duc best scoring system and the system mead summarizer
the results show that for both textual genres some relations have more effect on summarization compared to others
in both types of texts the contingency illustration and ison relations provide a signicant improvement on summary content while the attribution opinion and attributive relations do not provide a systematic and statistically signicant ment
these results seem to indicate that at least for summarization discourse relations are just as useful for informal and affective texts as for more traditional news articles
this is interesting cause although informal texts may not exhibit a clear discourse structure the use of individual course relations is nonetheless useful in the sis of informal documents
in the future it would be interesting to ate the effect of other relations such as the poral relation
indeed temporal relations occur infrequently in blogs but are very frequent in news articles
such an analysis would allow us to lor the type of discourse relations to include in the nal summary as a function of the textual genre being considered
in the future it would also be interesting to use other types of texts such as reviews and evaluate the effect of discourse relations using other measures than and rouge
finally we would like to validate this work again with the newly able discourse parsers of hernault et al
