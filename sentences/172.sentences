cross language text summarization generates summaries in a language dierent from the language of the source documents
cent methods use information from both languages to generate maries with the most informative sentences
however these methods have performance that can vary according to languages which can duce the quality of summaries
in this paper we propose a compressive framework to generate cross language summaries
in order to analyze performance and especially stability we tested our system and tive baselines on a dataset available in four languages english french portuguese and spanish to generate english and french summaries
an automatic evaluation showed that our method outperformed extractive state of art clts methods with better and more stable rouge scores for all languages
introduction cross language text summarization clts aims to generate a summary of a document where the summary language diers from the document language

many of the state of the art methods for clts are of the extractive class
they mainly dier on how they compute sentence similarities and alleviate the risk that translation errors are introduced in the produced summary
previous works analyze the clts only between two languages for a given dataset which does not demonstrate the stability of methods for dierent texts and languages
recent works carried out compressive approaches based on neural networks phrase segmentation and graph theory
among these models linhares pontes et al introduced the use of chunks and two compression methods at the sentence and multi sentence levels to improve the informativeness of language summaries
in this paper we adapt the method presented in to perform clts for several languages
more precisely we modied the creation of chunks and we simplied their multi sentence compression method to be able to analyze eral languages and compress small clusters of similar sentences
to demonstrate the stability of our system we extend the multiling pilot dataset
with two romance languages portuguese and spanish to test our system to generate french portuguese english and english portuguese to french cross language summaries
finally we carried out an automatic uation to make a systematic performance analysis of systems which details the characteristics of each language and their impacts on the cross language maries

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows
section details our contributions to the compressive clts approach
in section we describe the most recent works about clts
section reports the results achieved on the extended version of the multiling dataset and the analysis of cross language summaries
finally conclusions and future work are set out in section
compressive cross language text summarization
following the approach proposed by linhares pontes et al
we combined the analysis of documents in the source and the target languages with sentence compression msc to generate more informative summaries
we panded this approach in three ways

in order to simplify and to extend the analysis to several languages we only use multi word expressions for the english target language and we replace the analysis of parallel phrases with syntactic patterns to create chunks
then we also optimized the msc method for small clusters by removing the analysis of grams
unfortunately we have not found any available dataset for sentence compression in other languages therefore we restrict the use of compressive methods to msc
finally dierently from compressed versions of sentences were considered in the corank method instead of the only original versions in order to estimate the relevance of sentences for summaries
the following subsections highlight our contributions to the architecture of the method presented in

preprocessing initially source texts are translated into english and french with the google translate which was used in the majority of the state of the art clts methods
then a chunk level tokenization is performed on the target language side

we applied two simple syntactic patterns to identify useful structures p for english and p
for
french where adj stands for adjective np for proper noun and nc for common noun
we also use the stanford corenlp tool for the english translations

this tool detects phrasal verbs proper names idioms and so on
unfortunately we did not nd a similar tool for french consequently the french chunk level tokenization is limited to the syntactic pattern
multi sentence compression
we aim to generate a single short and informative compression from clusters of similar sentences
therefore we use the linhares pontes et al
s
method
to create clusters of similar sentences based on their similarity in the source and the target languages
as the majority of clusters are composed of few similar sentences normally two or three sentences grams are not frequent and the associated score is of little interest for the compress process
therefore we simplify the linhares pontes et al
s
method
to process msc guided only by the cohesion of words and keywords
our msc method looks for a sentence that has a good cohesion and the maximum of keywords inside a word graph built for each cluster of similar sentences according to the method devised by filippova
in this graph arcs between two vertices representing words or chunks are weighted by a cohesion score that is dened by the frequency of these words inside the cluster
vertices are labeled depending on whether they are or not a keyword identied by the latent dirichlet allocation lda method inside the cluster see for more details
from these scores and labels the msc problem is expressed as the following objective minimize j xi bl ll
x where xij indicates the existence of the arc i j in the solution j is the cohesion of the words i and j l is the set of labels each representing a keyword bl indicates the existence of a chunk with a keyword l in the solution k is the keyword bonus of the
finally we generate the best solutions according to the objective and we select the compression with the lowest normalized score equation as the best compression
where is the score of the compression c from equation
we restrict the msc method to the sentences in the target language in order to avoid errors generated by machine translation which would be applied in a post processing step on compressed sentences

the keyword bonus is dened by the geometric average of all weight arcs in the graph and aims at favoring compressions with several keywords
corank method sentences are scored based on their information in both languages using the corank method which analyzes sentences in each language separately but also between languages equations
u u mtg v v v mtg u
m tg ij

if i
otherwise m sc ij
i ssc j

if i
otherwise q mtg sc ij
i ssc j i stg j where mtg and msc are normalized to m respectively to make the sum of each row equal to
u and v denote the relevance of the source and target language sentences respectively
and specify the relative contributions to the nal scores from the information in the source and the target languages with and m tg sc
finally summaries are generated with the most relevant sentences in the target language
we add a sentence compression to the summary only if it is suciently dierent from the sentences compressions already in the summary
related work cross language text summarization schemes can be divided in early and late translations and joint analysis
the early translation rst translates documents to the target language then it summarizes these translated documents using only information of these translations
the late translation scheme does the reverse

the joint analysis combines the information from both languages to extract the most relevant information

regarding the analysis of machine translation quality wan et al
and boudin et al
used sentence features sentence length number of ation marks number of phrases in the parse tree to estimate the translation quality of a sentence
wan et al used an annotated dataset made of pairs of english chinese sentences with translation quality scores to train their support vector machine svm regression method
finally sentences that have a high translation quality and a high informativeness were selected for the summaries

similarly boudin et al trained an e svr using a dataset composed of english and automatic french translation sentences to calculate the translation ity based on the nist metrics
then they used the pagerank algorithm to estimate the relevance of sentences based on their similarities and translation quality
yao et al devised a phrase based model to jointly carry out sentence scoring and sentence compression
they developed a scoring scheme for the clts task based on a submodular term of compressed sentences and a bounded distortion penalty term

wan leverages the information in the source and in the target language for cross language summarization
he proposed two graph based tion methods simfusion and corank for the english to chinese clts task

the rst method linearly fuses the english side and chinese side similarities for measuring chinese sentence similarity
in a nutshell this method adapts the pagerank algorithm to calculate the relevance of sentences where the weight arcs are obtained by the linear combination of the cosine similarity of pairs of sentences for each language
the corank method was described in section
recently wan et al
carried out the cross language document tion task by extraction and ranking of multiple summaries in the target language

they analyzed many summaries in order to produce high quality summaries for every kind of documents
their method uses a top k ensemble ranking for candidate summary based on features that characterize the quality of a date summary
they used multiple text summarization and machine translation methods to generate the summaries

in order to generate abstractive cross lingual summaries zhang et al
extended the work of bing et al
that constructs new sentences by exploring noun verb phrases
their method rst constructs a pool of concepts and facts represented by phrases in english and chinese translation sentences
then new sentences are generated by selecting and merging informative phrases in both languages to maximize the salience of phrases and meanwhile satisfy the sentence construction constraints
they employ integer linear optimization for conducting phrase selection and merging simultaneously in order to generate informative cross lingual summaries with a good translation quality
this method generates abstractive summaries however the framework to identify concepts and facts only works for english which prevents this method from being extended for other languages
experimental evaluation
we estimate the performance of our approach in relation to the early and the late translations simfusion and corank
all systems generate summaries containing a maximum of words with the best scored sentences without redundant sentences
we regard a similarity score cosine similarity with a threshold of to create clusters of similar sentences for the and a threshold of to remove redundant sentences in the summary generation

we used the same conguration for simfusion and corank as described in


unfortunately the majority of state of the art systems in clts are not available

therefore we only considered extractive systems in our analysis

we use the same threshold of described in for french to english language summaries
datasets
we used the english and french language versions of the multiling pilot dataset
this dataset contains topics which have source texts and ence summaries per topic
these summaries are composed of words
in order to extend the analysis to other languages english source texts were translated into the portuguese and spanish languages by native speakers
specically we use english french portuguese and spanish texts to test our system
evaluation an automatic evaluation with rouge
was carried out to compare the dierences between the distribution of n grams of the candidate summary and a set of reference summaries
more specically we used unigram or bigram rouge or and skip gram rouge or r analyses

table describes the rouge scores obtained by each system to generate french summaries from english portuguese and spanish source texts
despite using the information from both languages the simfusion method achieved parable results with respect to the early and late approaches
on the contrary corank and our approach consistently obtained better results than other lines with at least an absolute dierence of in for all languages

the msc method improved the corank method by generating more informative compressions for all languages
the last two lines show that chunks helped our msc method to generate slightly more informative summaries better scores

chunks
the multiling dataset is composed of topics in several languages however these topics are expressed in dierent ways for each language
these ties implies a variety of vocabulary sizes and sentence lengths and consequently
the extension of the multiling pilot dataset is available at
of outputs of the mt system from each source language table
the biggest dierence in the statistics is between english source texts and its french tion vocabulary
french translations signicantly increased the vocabulary from english source texts and the number of words
these translations also are longer than source texts except for the spanish that has similar characteristics
our simple syntactic pattern created similar numbers of chunks for all languages with the same average length
the addition of these simple chunks did not nicantly improve the informativeness of our compressions

these dierences also act on the clustering process and the msc method

table details the number and the average size of clusters with at least two
french sentences translated from each source language
french translations from portuguese produced the shortest compressions words while compressions from spanish had the highest compression ratio
with respect to other languages the similarity of the sentences translated from english is lower which leads to fewer clusters
summaries from spanish have a larger proportion of compressions in the summaries than other languages

we apply a similar analysis for the generation of english summaries from french portuguese and spanish source texts
as observed before for french summaries the joint analysis still outperformed other baselines table
while corank obtained a large range of rouge scores among dierent languages between and our approach obtained the best rouge scores for all languages with a small dierence of rouge scores tween and which proves that our method generates more stable cross language summaries for several languages
chunks spot by the syntactic pattern and the stanford corenlp helped our approach to produce more mative compressions which results in better rouge scores

our approach
our approach chunks

english translations have fewer words and a smaller vocabulary dierence bigger than words than source texts table
these translations also have shorter sentences and a more similar vocabulary size than french tions and source texts
the combination of syntactic patterns and the stanford corenlp led to the same characteristics of chunks in terms of numbers and sizes

these translations from french source texts have more clusters because we used a smaller similarity threshold to consider two sentences as lar
english summaries from french have more compressions because of the large number of clusters

average compression rate of compressions french portuguese spanish french and portuguese source texts have almost the same number of tences while english and spanish source texts have fewer sentences
comparing the results of english and french translations english compressions are shorter than french compressions
the use of chunks in msc improved the results of our cross language summaries especially for english translations that have chunks that are more numerous and complex than french translations
to sum up our approach has shown to be more stable than extractive ods thus generating more informative cross language summaries with consistent
rouge scores measured in several languages
conclusion cross language text summarization clts produces a summary in a target language from documents written in a source language
it implies a combination of the processes of automatic summarization and machine translation
nately this combination produces errors thereby reducing the quality of maries
a joint analysis allows clts systems to extract relevant information from source and target languages which improves the generation of extractive cross language summaries
recent methods have proposed compressive and stractive approaches for clts however these methods use frameworks or tools that are available in few languages limiting the portability of these methods to other languages
our multi sentence compression msc approach generates informative compressions from several perspectives translations from dierent languages and achieves stable rouge results for all languages
in addition our method can be easily adapted to other languages
as future work we plan to reduce the number of errors generated from the pipeline made of the compression and machine translation processes by oping a neural network method to jointly translate and compress sentences
it would also be interesting to include a neural language model to correct possible errors produced during the sentence compression process
