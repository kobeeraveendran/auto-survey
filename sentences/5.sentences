s c v s c v i x r a a sentimental education sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts bo pang and lillian lee department of computer science cornell university ithaca ny pabo

edu abstract sentiment analysis seeks to identify the underlying a text span an example cation is classifying a movie review as thumbs up or thumbs down
to determine this sentiment larity we propose a novel machine learning method that applies text categorization techniques to just the subjective portions of the document
extracting these portions can be implemented using efcient techniques for nding minimum cuts in graphs this greatly facilitates incorporation of cross sentence contextual constraints
publication info proceedings of the acl
introduction the computational treatment of opinion sentiment and subjectivity has recently attracted a great deal of attention see references in part because of its potential applications
for instance extraction and question answering systems could ag statements and queries regarding opinions rather than facts cardie et al

also it has proven useful for companies recommender tems and editorial sites to create summaries of ple s experiences and opinions that consist of jective expressions extracted from reviews as is commonly done in movie ads or even just a view s polarity positive thumbs up or ative thumbs down
document polarity classication poses a nicant challenge to data driven methods sisting traditional text categorization techniques pang lee and vaithyanathan
previous proaches focused on selecting indicative lexical tures e

the word good classifying a ment according to the number of such features that occur anywhere within it
in contrast we propose the following process label the sentences in the document as either subjective or objective carding the latter and then apply a standard machine learning classier to the resulting extract
this can prevent the polarity classier from ering irrelevant or even potentially misleading text for example although the sentence the protagonist tries to protect her good name contains the word good it tells us nothing about the author s ion and in fact could well be embedded in a negative movie review
also as mentioned above ity extracts can be provided to users as a summary of the sentiment oriented content of the document
our results show that the subjectivity extracts we create accurately represent the sentiment formation of the originating documents in a much more compact form depending on choice of stream polarity classier we can achieve highly tistically signicant improvement from
to
or maintain the same level of performance for the polarity classication task while retaining only of the reviews words
also we plore extraction methods based on a minimum cut formulation which provides an efcient intuitive and effective means for integrating inter level contextual information with traditional bag words features
method
architecture one can consider document level polarity cation to be just a special more difcult case of text categorization with rather than topic based categories
hence standard learning classication techniques such as port vector machines svms can be applied to the entire documents themselves as was done by pang lee and vaithyanathan
we refer to such classication techniques as default polarity classiers
however as noted above we may be able to prove polarity classication by removing objective sentences such as plot summaries in a movie view
we therefore propose as depicted in figure to rst employ a subjectivity detector that mines whether each sentence is subjective or not discarding the objective ones creates an extract that should better represent a review s subjective content to a default polarity classier

sentence level to our knowledge previous work has not subjectivity integrated sentiment polarity
tion with document level yu and hatzivassiloglou provide methods for sentence level analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classication
the motivation behind the single sentence selection method of beineke et al
is to reveal a document s sentiment polarity but they do not evaluate the polarity classication accuracy that results

context and subjectivity detection as with document level polarity classication we could perform subjectivity detection on individual sentences by applying a standard classication rithm on each sentence in isolation
however eling proximity relationships between sentences would enable us to leverage coherence text spans occurring near each other within discourse aries may share the same subjectivity status other things being equal wiebe
we would therefore like to supply our algorithms with pair wise interaction information e

to ify that two particular sentences should ideally ceive the same subjectivity label but not state which label this should be
incorporating such tion is somewhat unnatural for classiers whose input consists simply of individual feature tors such as naive bayes or svms precisely cause such classiers label each test item in tion
one could dene synthetic features or ture vectors to attempt to overcome this obstacle
however we propose an alternative that avoids the need for such feature engineering we use an cient and intuitive graph based formulation ing on nding minimum cuts
our approach is spired by blum and chawla although they focused on similarity between items the tion being to combine labeled and unlabeled data whereas we are concerned with physical proximity between the items to be classied indeed in puter vision modeling proximity information via graph cuts has led to very effective classication boykov veksler and zabih

cut based classication figure shows a worked example of the concepts in this section
suppose we have n items


xn to divide into two classes and and we have access to two types of information individual scores non negative mates of each xi s preference for being in cj based on just the features of alone and association scores xk non negative estimates of how important it is that xi and xk be in the same class
we would like to maximize each item s net piness its individual score for the class it is signed to minus its individual score for the other class
but we also want to penalize putting associated items into different classes
thus after some algebra we arrive at the following tion problem assign the xis to and so as to minimize the partition cost xk
x x the problem appears intractable since there are possible binary partitions of the xi s
ever suppose we represent the situation in the lowing manner
build an undirected graph g with vertices


vn s t the last two are tively the source and sink
add n edges s vi each with weight and n edges vi t each with weight
finally add edges vi vk each with weight xk
then cuts in g are dened as follows n denition a cut s t of g is a partition of its nodes into sets s s s and t t t where s s t t
its cost t is the sum is allowed but we used symmetric scores

association cost penalties



















figure graph for classifying three items
brackets enclose example values here the individual scores happen to be probabilities
based on individual scores alone we would put y yes in n no in and be undecided about m maybe
but the association scores favor cuts that put y and m in the same class as shown in the table
thus the minimum cut indicated by the dashed line places m together with y in
of the weights of all edges crossing from s to t
a minimum cut of g is one of minimum cost
observe that every cut corresponds to a partition of the items and has cost equal to the partition cost
thus our optimization problem reduces to nding minimum cuts
practical advantages as we have noted ing our subjectivity detection problem in terms of graphs allows us to model item specic and wise information independently
note that this is a very exible paradigm
for instance it is fectly legitimate to use knowledge rich algorithms employing deep linguistic knowledge about timent indicators to derive the individual scores
and we could also simultaneously use lean methods to assign the association scores
terestingly yu and hatzivassiloglou pared an individual preference classier against a relationship based method but did nt combine the two the ability to coordinate such algorithms is precisely one of the strengths of our approach
but a crucial advantage specic to the lization of a minimum cut based approach is that we can use algorithms with polynomial asymptotic running times and near linear running times in practice to actly compute the minimum cost despite the optimization the apparent cormen leiserson and rivest problem ahuja magnanti and orlin

subjectivity dataset to train our detectors we need a collection of labeled sentences
riloff and wiebe state that it is very hard to tain collections of individual sentences that can be the easily identied as subjective or objective polarity dataset sentences for example have not been so annotated
fortunately we were able to mine the web to create a large labeled sentence
to gather subjective sentences or phrases we collected review snippets e

bold imaginative and possible to resist from www
rottentomatoes
com
to obtain mostly objective data we took tences from plot summaries available from the ternet movie database www
imdb
com
we only selected sentences or snippets at least ten words long and drawn from reviews or plot summaries of movies released which prevents overlap with the polarity dataset
subjectivity detectors as noted above we can use our default polarity classiers as basic level subjectivity detectors after retraining on the subjectivity dataset to produce extracts of the inal reviews
we also create a family of cut based subjectivity detectors these take as input the set of sentences appearing in a single document and termine the subjectivity status of all the sentences simultaneously using per item and pairwise tionship information
specically for a given ument we use the construction in section
to build a graph wherein the source s and sink t respond to the class of subjective and objective tences respectively and each internal node vi responds to the document s ith sentence
we can set the individual scores to p rn b sub and to p rn b sub as shown in figure where p rn b sub s denotes naive bayes estimate of the probability that sentence is subjective or we can use the weights produced by the svm er instead
if we set all the association scores to zero then the minimum cut classication of the therefore could not directly evaluate classication accuracy on the polarity dataset

section
examines our basic subjectivity tion algorithms which are based on sentence predictions alone
section
evaluates the more sophisticated form of subjectivity tion that incorporates context information via the minimum cut paradigm
as we will see the use of subjectivity extracts can in the best case provide satisfying ment in polarity classication and otherwise can at least yield polarity classication accuracies tinguishable from employing the full review
at the same time the extracts we create are both smaller on average than the original document and more effective as input to a default polarity classier than the same length counterparts produced by dard summarization tactics e

or last n tences
we therefore conclude that subjectivity traction produces effective summaries of document sentiment

basic subjectivity extraction as noted in section both naive bayes and svms can be trained on our subjectivity dataset and then used as a basic subjectivity detector
the former has somewhat better average ten fold cross validation performance on the subjectivity dataset vs
and so for space reasons our initial sions will focus on the results attained via nb jectivity detection
training is driven by optimizing the performance of the downstream polarity classier rather than the detector itself because the subjectivity dataset s sentences come from different reviews and so are never proximal

this is a clear improvement over the

paired t test
with svms as the polarity classier instead the full view performance rises to

more improvements to extraction mance are reported later in this section
these ndings that the extracts serve and in the nb polarity classier case ently clarify the sentiment information in the inating documents and thus are good summaries from the polarity classication point of view
ther support comes from a ipping experiment if we give as input to the default polarity classier an extract consisting of the sentences labeled jective accuracy drops dramatically to for nb and for svms
this conrms our hypothesis that sentences discarded by the subjectivity tion process are indeed much less indicative of timent polarity
moreover the subjectivity extracts are much more compact than the original documents an portant feature for a summary to have they contain on average only about of the source reviews words
this word preservation rate is plotted along the axis in the graphs in figure
this prompts us to study how much reduction of the original uments subjectivity detectors can perform and still result and others are depicted in figure for now consider only the y axis in those plots
that direct evidence is not available because the larity dataset s sentences lack subjectivity labels
accurately represent the texts sentiment tion
we can create subjectivity extracts of varying lengths by taking just the n most subjective from the originating review
as one baseline to compare against we take the cal summarization standard of extracting the rst n sentences in general settings authors ten begin documents with an overview
we also in many consider the last n sentences ments concluding material may be a good mary and www
rottentomatoes
com tends to lect snippets from the end of movie reviews beineke et al

finally as a sanity check we include results from the n least subjective tences according to naive bayes
figure shows the polarity classier results as n ranges between and
our rst observation is that the nb detector provides very good bang for the buck with subjectivity extracts containing as few as sentences accuracy is quite close to what one gets if the entire review is used
in fact for the nb polarity classier just using the most subjective sentences is almost as informative as the full review while containing on average only about of the source reviews words
also it so happens that at n performance is actually slightly better than but statistically distinguishable from full review even when the svm default polarity classier is used
vs


this suggests potentially effective traction alternatives other than using a xed are the n sentences assigned the highest probability by the basic nb detector regardless of whether their ities exceed and so would actually be classied as tive by naive bayes
for reviews with fewer than n sentences the entire review will be returned

furthermore we see in figure that the n subjective sentences method generally outperforms the other baseline summarization methods which perhaps suggests that sentiment summarization not be treated the same as topic based tion although this conjecture would need to be ed on other domains and data
it s also interesting to observe how much better the last n sentences are than the rst n sentences this may reect a hardly surprising tendency for movie review authors to place plot descriptions at the beginning rather than the end of the text and conclude with overtly ionated statements

incorporating context information the context information particularly regarding sentence proximity can further improve subjectivity tion
as discussed in section
and textual constraints are easily incorporated via the minimum cut formalism but are not natural inputs for standard naive bayes and svms
effect of adding in figure shows proximity information
and are the graph based subjectivity detectors using naive bayes and svms tively for the individual scores we depict the best performance achieved by a single setting of the three proximity related edge weight parameters over all ten data parameter selection was not a focus of the current work
the two isons we are most interested in are versus extractnb and versus the previous section demonstrated the value of subjectivity detection
we now examine whether are chosen from t and at intervals of

d e extractsvm
we see that the context aware graph based jectivity detectors tend to create extracts that are more informative statistically signicant so paired t test for svm subjectivity detectors only though these extracts are longer than their blind counterparts
we note that the performance enhancements can not be attributed entirely to the mere inclusion of more sentences regardless of whether they are subjective or not one argument is that full review yielded substantially worse results for the nb default polarity classier and at any rate the graph derived extracts are still substantially more concise than the full texts
now while incorporating a bias for assigning nearby sentences to the same category into nb and svm subjectivity detectors seems to require some non obvious feature engineering we also wish to investigate whether our graph based paradigm makes better use of contextual constraints that can be more or less easily encoded into the input of standard classiers
for illustrative purposes we consider paragraph boundary information looking only at svm subjectivity detection for simplicity s sake
it seems intuitively plausible that paragraph boundaries an approximation to discourse aries loosen coherence constraints between nearby sentences
to capture this notion for minimum based classication we can simply reduce the sociation scores for all pairs of sentences that cur in different paragraphs by multiplying them by a cross paragraph boundary weight w
for standard classiers we can employ the trick of ing the detector treat paragraphs rather than tences as the basic unit to be labeled
this ables the standard classier to utilize coherence tween sentences in the same paragraph on the other hand it also probably unavoidably poses a hard constraint that all of a paragraph s sentences get the same label which increases noise sensitivity
our experiments reveal the graph cut formulation to be the better approach for both default polarity siers nb and svm some choice of parameters including w for yields cally signicant improvement over its unit non graph counterpart nb

conclusions we examined the relation between subjectivity tection and polarity classication showing that example in the data we used boundaries may have been missed due to malformed html
jectivity detection can compress reviews into much shorter extracts that still retain polarity information at a level comparable to that of the full review
in fact for the naive bayes polarity classier the jectivity extracts are shown to be more effective put than the originating document which suggests that they are not only shorter but also cleaner resentations of the intended polarity
we have also shown that employing the minimum cut framework results in the ment of efcient algorithms for sentiment sis
utilizing contextual information via this work can lead to statistically signicant ment in polarity classication accuracy
directions for future research include developing selection techniques incorporating other sources of contextual cues besides sentence proximity and vestigating other means for modeling such tion
