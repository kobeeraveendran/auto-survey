v i x r a abstract automatic abstractive summaries are found to often distort or fabricate facts in the article
this inconsistency between summary and inal text has seriously impacted its ity
we propose a fact aware summarization model fasum to extract and integrate factual relations into the summary generation process via graph attention
we then design a factual corrector model fc to automatically correct factual errors from summaries generated by isting systems
empirical show that the fact aware summarization can produce stractive summaries with higher factual tency compared with existing systems and the correction model improves the factual tency of given summaries via modifying only a few keywords
introduction text summarization models aim to produce an abridged version of long text while preserving salient information
abstractive summarization is a type of such models that can freely generate maries with no constraint on the words or phrases used
this format is closer to human edited maries and is both exible and informative
thus there are numerous approaches to produce tive summaries see et al
paulus et al
dong et al
gehrmann et al

however one prominent issue with abstractive summarization is factual inconsistency
it refers to the hallucination phenomenon that the summary sometimes distorts or fabricates the facts in the article
recent studies show that up to of the summaries generated by abstractive models contain such factual inconsistencies kryscinski et al
falke et al
raising concerns about the credibility and usability of these systems

table example article and summary excerpts from cnn dailymail dataset
table demonstrates an example article and cerpts of generated summaries
as shown the ticle mentions that real madrid ace gareth bale scored twice and cristiano ronaldo scored ve goals
however both bottomup gehrmann et al
and wrongly states that bale scored ve goals
comparatively our model fasum generates a summary that correctly hibits the fact in the article
and as shown in tion

our model achieves higher factual sistency not just by making more copies from the article
on the other hand most existing abstractive marization models apply a conditional language model to focus on the token level accuracy of summaries while neglecting semantic level tency between the summary and article
therefore the generated summaries are often high in level metrics like rouge lin but lack factual consistency
in view of this we argue that a robust abstractive summarization system must be equipped with factual knowledge to accurately summarize the article

in this paper we represent facts in the form of knowledge graphs

article bottomup corrected by fc table example excerpts of an article from cnn dailymail and the summary generated by bottomup
factual errors are marked in red
the correction made by our model fc are marked in green
efforts in building commonly applicable knowledge graphs such as conceptnet speer et al
we nd that these tools are more useful in conferring commonsense knowledge
in abstractive rization for contents like news articles many ties and relations are previously unseen
plus our goal is to produce summaries that do not conict with the facts in the article
thus we propose to extract factual knowledge from the article itself
we employ the information extraction ie tool openie angeli et al
to extract facts from the article in the form of relational tuples subject relation object
this graph contains the facts in the article and is integrated in the summary tion process
then we use a graph attention network velickovic et al
to obtain the representation of each node and fuse that into a transformer based encoder decoder architecture via attention
we note this model as the fact aware summarization model fasum
in addition to be generally applicable for all existing summarization systems we propose a tual corrector model fc to help improve the tual consistency of any given summary
we frame the correction process as a problem the put is the original summary and the article and the output is the corrected summary
fc has the same architecture as unilm dong et al
and tialized with weights from roberta large liu et al

we netune it as a denoising coder
the training data is synthetically generated via randomly replacing entities in the ground truth summary with wrong ones in the article
as shown in table fc makes three corrections replacing the original wrong entities which appear elsewhere in the article with the right ones
in the experiments we leverage an dently trained bert based devlin et al
factual consistency evaluator kryscinski et al

results show that on cnn dailymail sum obtains
higher fact consistency scores than unilm dong et al
and
higher than bottomup gehrmann et al

over after correction by fc the factual score of summaries from bottomup increases
on cnn dailymail and
on xsum and the score of summaries from increases
on xsum
we also conduct human evaluation to verify the effectiveness of our models
we further propose an easy to compute free metric relation matching rate rmr to uate factual consistency given a summary and the article
this metric employs the extracted relations and does not require human labelled summaries
under this metric we show that our models can help enhance the factual consistency of summaries

wang et al
mus et al

kryscinski et al
applies various transformations on the mary to produce training data for a bert based classication model factcc which shows a high correlation with human metrics
therefore we use factcc as the factual evaluator in this paper
model
problem formulation we formalize abstractive summarization as a supervised problem
the input sists of a pairs of articles and summaries


xa ya
each article is tokenized into xi


xli and each summary is tokenized into yi



in abstrative summarization the model generated summary can contain tokens phrases and tences not present in the article
for ity in the following we will drop the data dex subscript
therefore each training pair comes x


xm y


and the model needs to generate an abstrative summary




fact aware summarizer we propose the fact aware abstractive rizer fasum
it utilizes the architecture built upon transformers vaswani et al

in detail the encoder produces contextualized dings of the article and the decoder attends to the encoder s output to generate the summary
to make the summarization model fact aware we extract represent and integrate knowledge from the source article into the summary generation cess which is described in the following
the all architecture of fasum is shown in figure


knowledge extraction to extract important entity relation information from the article we employ the stanford openie tool angeli et al

the extracted knowledge is a list of tuples
each tuple contains a subject s a relation r and an object o each as a segment of text from the article
in the experiments there are on average
tuples extracted per article in cnn dailymail hermann et al
and
tuples in xsum narayan et al



knowledge representation we construct a knowledge graph to represent the information extracted from openie
we apply the levi transformation levi to treat each entity and relation equally
in detail suppose a tuple is s r o we create nodes s r and o and add edges r and o
in this way we obtain an rected knowledge graph g v e where each node v v is associated with text
during training this graph g is constructed for each batch individually i
e
there s no shared huge graph
one benet is that the model can take unseen entities and relations during inference
we then employ a graph attention network velickovic et al
to obtain embedding ej for each node vj
the initial embedding of vj is given by the last hidden state of a bidirectional lstm figure the model architecture of fasum
it has l layers of transformer blocks in both the encoder and decoder
the knowledge graph is obtained from information extraction results and it participates in the decoder s attention
applied to
in the experiment we employ graph attention layers


knowledge integration the knowledge graph embedding is obtained in allel with the encoder
then apart from the cal cross attention over the encoder s outputs each decoder block also computes cross attention over the knowlege graph nodes embeddings ij jv i ej ij st ui ijej jv where graph nodes and representation of the rst t generated tokens
are the nal embeddings of the are the decoder block

summary generation we denote the nal output of the decoder as


zt
to produce the next token we ploy a linear layer w to project zt to a vector of the same size of the dictionary
and the predicted distribution of is obtained by zt during training we use cross entropy as the loss function t where yt is yt the one hot vector for the t token and sent the parameters in the network

fact corrector to better utilize existing summarization systems we propose a factual corrector model fc to prove the factual consistency of any summary erated by abstractive systems
fc frames the rection process as a problem given an article and a candidate summary the model ates a corrected summary with minimal changes to be more factually consistent with the article
while fasum has a graph attention module in the transformer preventing direct adaptation from pre trained models the fc model ture adopts the design of the pre trained model unilm dong et al

we initiailized the model weights from roberta large liu et al

the netuning process is similar to training a denoising autoencoder
we use back translation and entity swap for synthetic data generation
for example an entity in the ground truth summary is randomly replaced with another entity of the same type from the article
this modied summary and the article is sent to the corrector to recover the original summary
in the experiments we self attnadd normadd normfeed forwardself attnadd normadd normfeed forwardcross attnadd normcross attnadd normlinearencoderknowledge graphdecoderarticlefirst k summary tokensgraph attn netbilstminformation articlelevi ated
m data samples in cnn dailymail and
k samples in xsum for netuning
we take k samples in each dataset for validation and use the rest for training
during inference the candidate summary from any abstractive summarization system is nated with the article and sent to fc which duces the corrected summary
experiments
datasets we evaluate our model on benchmark rization datasets cnn dailymail hermann et al
and xsum narayan et al

they contain k and k news articles and edited summaries respectively covering different topics and various summarization styles

implementation details we use the huggingface s wolf et al
plementation of transformer in bart lewis et al

we also inherit their provided eters of cnn dailymail and xsum for the beam search
the minimum summary length is and for cnn daily mail and xsum respectively
the number of beams is for cnn dailymail and for xsum
in fasum both the encoder and decoder has layers of heads for attention
teacher forcing is used in training
we use adam kingma and ba as the optimizer with a learning rate of
the bi lstm to produce the initial embedding of graph nodes has a hidden state of size and the graph attention network gat has heads and a hidden state of size
the dropout rate is
in gat and
elsewhere
we use the subword tokenizer sentencepiece kudo and richardson
the dictionary is shared across all the datasets
the vocabulary has a size of k and a dimension of
the correction model fc follows the unilm dong et al
architecture initialized with weights from roberta large liu et al

we ne tune the model for epochs with a learning rate of and linear warmup over the of total steps and linear decay
during decoding it uses beam search with a width of and blocks gram duplicates
the batch size during netuning is
more details are presented in the appendix

metrics to evaluate factual consistency we re implemented and trained the factcc model kryscinski et al

the model outputs a score between and where a higher score indicates better consistency between the input article and summary
the ing of factcc is independent of our summarizer so no parameters are shared
more details are in the appendix
we also employ the standard and rouge l metrics lin to measure summary qualities
these three metrics evaluate the accuracy on unigrams bigrams and the longest common subsequence
we report the rouge scores in all experiments
and the rouge l score on validation set is used to pick the best model for both fasum and fc

baselines the following abstractive summarization models are selected as baseline systems
narayan et al
is based on topic modeling and convolutional neural networks
bottomup gehrmann et al
uses a bottom up approach to generate summarization
unilm dong et al
utilizes large scale pretraining to produce state of the art abstractive summaries
we train the baseline models when the predictions are not available in their open source repositories

results as shown in table our model performs all baseline systems in factual tency scores in cnn dailymail and is only hind unilm in xsum
in cnn dailymail sum is
higher than unilm and
higher than bottomup in factual score
statistical test shows that the lead is statistically signicant with value smaller than

the higher factual score of unilm among baselines corroborates the ndings in maynez et al
that pre trained models hibit better factuality
but our proposed knowledge graph component can help the train from scratch fasum model to excel in factual consistency
we conduct ablation study to remove the edge graph component from fasum resulting in the model
as shown there is a clear drop in factual score
in cnn dailymail and
in xsum
this proves that the constructed have put code and all the generated summaries of all models in the supplementary materials
knowledge graph can help increase the factual rectess of the generated summaries
it s worth noticing that the rouge metric does not always reect the factual consistency times even showing an inverse relationship a nomenon observed in multiple studies kryscinski et al
maynez et al

for instance although bottomup has
higher points than fasum in cnn dailymail there are many factual errors in its summaries as shown in the human evaluation
on the other hand to make sure the improved factual correctness of our els is not achieved by simply copying insignicant information from the article we conduct analysis on abstractiveness in section

and human uation in section


furthermore the correction model fc can fectively enhance the factual consistency of maries generated by various baseline models cially when the original summary has a relatively low factual consistency
for instance on cnn dm the factual score of bottomup increases by
after correction
on xsum after correction the factual scores increase by
to
for all line models
interestingly fc can also boost the factual consistency of our fasum model
more the correction has a rather small impact on the rouge score and it can improve the rouge scores of most models in xsum dataset
we check and nd that fc only makes modest modications necessary to the original summaries
for instance fc modies
of summaries erated by bottomup in cnn dailymail
these modied summaries contain very few changed kens
of these corrected summaries contain or fewer new tokens while the summaries have on average
tokens
in the appendix of supplementary materials we show several examples of summaries given by sum and corrected by fc to demonstrate the proved factual consistency of summarization

insights

novel n grams it has been shown in durmus et al
that less abstractive summaries are more factual consistent with the article
therefore we inspect whether our models boost factual consistency simply by copying more portions of the article
on xsum s testset we compute the ratio of novel n grams in summaries that do not appear figure percentage of novel n grams for summaries in xsum test set
in the article
figure shows that fasum achieves the closest ratio of novel n gram compared with reference summaries and higher than bottomup and unilm
this demonstrates that fasum can produce highly abstractive summaries while ing factual consistency


relation matching rate while the factual consistency evaluator factcc kryscinski et al
is based on pre trained models it requires netuning on articles and belled summaries
furthermore we empirically nd that the performance of factcc degrades when it is netuned on one summary dataset and used to evaluate models on another dataset
therefore in this subsection we design an to compute model free factual consistency metric which can be used when ground truth summaries are not available
as the relational tuples in the knowledge graph capture the factual information in the text we pute the precision of extracted tuples in the mary
in detail suppose the set of the relational tuples in the summary is rs ri oi and the set of the relational tuples in the article is ra
then each tuple in rs falls into one of the ing three categories
correct hit c ri oi ra
wrong hit w ri oi ra but oi ri ra or ri oi ra
miss m otherwise
we dene two kinds of relation matching rate of novel score rouge l

table average relation matching rate rmr eq

the arrow indicates whether larger or smaller value means better result
rmr to measure the ratio of correct hits c c w c c w m note that this metric is different from the ratio of overlapping tuples proposed in goodrich et al
where the ratio is computed between the ground truth and the candidate summary
since even the ground truth summary may not cover all the salient information in the article we choose to compare the knowledge tuples in the candidate summary directly against those in the article
an additional advantage of our metric is that it does not require ground truth summaries to be available
table displays the result of this metric in cnn dailymail s testset
as shown fasum achieves the highest precision of correct hits under both measures
and there is a considerable boost from the knowledge graph fasum vs
in and
in
and the rection from the fc model can further improve the metric for both fasum and unilm
we also compute factual consistency via natural language inference models following maynez et al

we use the bert large model netuned on mnli dataset williams et al
provided by fairseq ott et al

the model predicts the relationship between the article and summary to be one of the following entailment neutral and tradiction
we report the ratio of contradiction as predicted by the model in table
as shown sum achieves the lowest ratio and fc helps further reducing conicting facts in generated summaries


human evaluation we conduct human evaluation on the factual sistency and informativeness of summaries
we randomly sample articles from the test set of cnn dailymail
then each article and summary pair is labelled by people from amazon cal turk amt to evaluate the factual consistency and informativeness
each labeller gives a score in each category between and being perfect
the kappa ratio between reviewer scores is

factual consistency and
for informativeness
here factual consistency indicates whether the summary s content is faithful with respect to the article informativeness indicates how well the mary covers the salient information in the article
as shown in table our model fasum achieves the highest factual consistency score higher than unilm and considerably ing bottomup
we conduct a statistical test and nd that compared with unilm our model s score is statistically signicant with p value smaller than
under paired t test
in terms of ness our model is comparable with unilm and outperforms bottomup
finally without the knowledge graph component the model generates summaries with both less factual tency and informativeness
to assess the effectiveness of the correction model fc we conduct a human evaluation of by side summaries
in cnn dailymail we domly sample articles where the summaries generated by bottomup are modied by fc
labelers are asked whether the original or the rected version is factually more correct
we collect all the feedbacks and compute the ratio of ments for each case
to reduce bias we randomly shufe the two versions of summaries
we conduct similar evaluation on unilm
as shown in table the corrected summaries are signicantly more likely to be judged as more factually correct for both baseline models
for ample
of the judgements think the corrected summaries are factually more correct
think the corrected version neither improves nor ens the factual consistency while only
think that the corrected version becomes worse than the original bottomup summary
therefore fc can help boost the factual consistency of summaries from given systems
finally to evaluate the quality of the relation matching rate rmr we compute the correlation coefcient between the factual score given by man labelers and the rmr value
the result shows that
indicating observable relationship between rmr and human evaluation results
conclusion in this paper we extract factual information from the article to be represented by a knowledge graph
we then integrate this factual knowledge into the process of producing summaries
the resulting model fasum enhances the ability to preserve facts during summarization demonstrated by both automatic and human evaluation
we also present a correction model fc to rectify factual errors in candidate summaries
furthermore we propose an easy to compute model free metric relation ing rate to measure factual consistency based on the overlapping ratio of relational tuples
for future work we plan to integrate knowledge graphs into pre training for more accurate and tually consistent summarization
moreover we will combine the internally extracted knowledge graph with an external knowledge graph e
