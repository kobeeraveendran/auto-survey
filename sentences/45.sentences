rovisco pais lisboa portugal abstract we assess the performance of generic text summarization algorithms applied to lms and taries using extracts from news articles produced by reference models of extractive summarization
we use three datasets i news articles ii lm scripts and subtitles and iii documentary subtitles
standard rouge metrics are used for comparing generated summaries against news abstracts plot summaries and synopses
we show that the best performing algorithms are lsa for news articles and documentaries and lexrank and support sets for lms
despite the different nature of lms and documentaries their relative behavior is in accordance with that obtained for news articles

introduction input media for automatic summarization has varied from text to speech and video but the plication domain has been in general restricted to tive sources news meetings or tures
nevertheless application areas within the ment industry are gaining attention e

summarization of erary short stories music summarization tion of books or inclusion of character analyses in movie summaries
we follow this direction creating extractive text driven video summaries for lms and documentaries
documentaries started as cinematic portrayals of reality
today they continue to portray historical events tion and research
they are commonly understood as capturing reality and therefore seen as inherently
films in contrast are usually associated with ction
however lms and documentaries do not fundamentally differ many of the gies and narrative structures employed in lms are also used in documentaries
in the context of our work lms ctional tell stories based on ctive events whereas documentaries dress mostly scientic subjects
we study the parallelism tween the information carried in subtitles and scripts of both lms and documentaries
extractive summarization methods corresponding author e mail david
id
pt david martins de matos have been extensively explored for news documents
our main goal is to understand the ity of automatic summaries produced for lms and taries using the well known behavior of news articles as erence
generated summaries are evaluated against manual abstracts using rouge metrics which correlate with human judgements
this article is organized as follows section presents the summarization algorithms section presents the collected datasets section presents the evaluation setup section cusses our results section presents conclusions and tions for future work

generic summarization six text based summarization approaches were used to marize newspaper articles subtitles and scripts
they are scribed in the following sections


maximal marginal relevance mmr mmr is a query based summarization method
it atively selects sentences via equation q is a query and are similarity metrics si and sj are non selected and previously selected sentences respectively
balances vance and novelty
mmr can generate generic summaries by considering the input sentences centroid as a query
arg max si si q max si sj sj

lexrank lexrank is a centrality based method based on google s pagerank
a graph is built using sentences represented by tf idf vectors as vertexes
edges are created when the cosine similarity exceeds a threshold
equation is computed at each vertex until the error rate between two successive iterations is in this equation d is a damping lower than a certain value
factor to ensure the method s convergence n is the number of vertexes and s vi is the score of the ith vertex
s vi d n d vj sim vi vj sim vj vk s vj

latent semantic analysis lsa lsa infers contextual usage of text based on word occurrence
important topics are determined without the need for external lexical resources each word s currence context provides information concerning its meaning producing relations between words and sentences that correlate with the way humans make associations
singular value composition svd is applied to each document represented by a t n term by sentences matrix a resulting in its tion u v t
summarization consists of choosing the highest singular values from giving k
u and v t are reduced to respectively approximating a by ak ukkv t uk and v t
the most important sentences are selected from v t


support sets documents are typically composed by a mixture of subjects involving a main and various minor themes
support sets are dened based on this observation
important content is termined by creating a support set for each passage by ing it with all others
the most semantically related passages determined via geometric proximity are included in the support set
summaries are composed by selecting the most relevant passages i
e
the ones present in the largest number of support sets
for a segmented information source i


pn support sets si for each passage pi are dened by equation where sim is a similarity function and is a threshold
the most important passages are selected by equation
si i pi pi arg max su n

key phrase based centrality kp centrality ribeiro et al
proposed an extension of the centrality algorithm described in section
which uses a two stage portant passage retrieval method
the rst stage consists of a feature rich supervised key phrase extraction step using the maui toolkit with additional semantic features the detection of rhetorical signals the number of named entities part speech pos tags and n gram domain model probabilities
the second stage consists of the extraction of the most important passages where key phrases are considered regular passages


graph random walk with absorbing states that hops among peaks for ranking grasshopper grasshopper is a re ranking algorithm that mizes diversity and minimizes redundancy
it takes a weighted graph w n n n vertexes representing sentences weights are dened by a similarity measure a probability tion r representing a prior ranking and that balances the relative importance of w and r
if there is no prior ranking a uniform distribution can be used
sentences are ranked by applying the teleporting random walks method in an absorbing markov chain based on the n n tion matrix p calculated by normalizing the rows of w i
e
p p
the rst sentence to be scored is the one with the highest stationary probability arg maxn i according to the stationary distribution of p p
ready selected sentences may never be visited again by dening pgg and pgi i g
the expected number of visits is given by matrix n i where nij is the expected number of visits to the sentence j if the random walker began at sentence i
we obtain the average of all possible starting sentences to get the expected number of visits to the jth tence vj
the sentence to be selected is the one that satises arg maxn vi

datasets we use three datasets newspaper articles baseline data lms and documentaries
film data consists of subtitles and scripts containing scene descriptions and dialog
documentary data consists of subtitles containing mostly monologue
ence data consists of manual abstracts for newspaper articles plot summaries for lms and documentaries and synopses for lms
plot summaries are concise descriptions sufcient for the reader to get a sense of what happens in the lm or mentary
synopses are much longer and may contain important details concerning the turn of events in the story
all datasets were normalized by removing punctuation inside sentences and timestamps from subtitles


newspaper articles is composed by newspaper articles in brazilian portuguese table covering domains such as world politics and foreign affairs
each article has a human made reference summary abstract

we chose informative summaries due to their blance to the sentences extracted by the summarization rithms
on average there are informative plot summaries per documentary minimum of maximum of
table properties of the documentary plot summaries
sentences words informative interrogative inviting challenge informative interrogative inviting challenge avg min max
experimental setup for news articles summaries were generated with the age size of the manual abstracts of their size
for each lm two summaries were generated by selecting a number of sentences equal to i the average length of its ual plot summaries and the length of its synopsis
in trast with news articles and documentaries three types of input were considered script subtitles
for each documentary a summary was generated with the same average number of sentences of its manual plot summaries of the documentary s size
content quality of summaries is based on word overlap as dened by rouge between generated summaries and their references
rouge n computes the fraction of selected words that are correctly identied by the summarization algorithms cf
equation rs are reference summaries gramn is the gram length and is the maximum number of n grams of a candidate summary that co occur with a set of reference summaries
rouge su measures the overlap of skip bigrams any pair of words in their sentence order with the addition of unigrams as counting unit
rouge limits the maximum gap length of skip bigrams to
rouge n srs srs gramns gramns
results and discussion subtitles and scripts were evaluated against manual plot maries and synopses to dene an optimal performance erence
the following sections present averaged and rouge scores henceforth and r and the performance of each summarization algorithm as a ratio between the score of the generated summaries and this reference relative performance
several parametrizations of the algorithms were used we present only the best results
concerning mmr we found that the best corresponds to a higher average number of words per summary
concerning grasshopper we used the uniform distribution as prior

films table presents the scores for the lm data tions against plot summaries
overall support sets lsa and lexrank capture the most relevant sentences for plot summaries
it would be expected for algorithms such as grasshopper and mmr that maximize diversity to form well in this context because plot summaries are relatively small and focus on the more important aspects of the lm ally without redundant content
however our results show erwise
for scripts lsa and lexrank are the best approaches in terms of and r
table presents the scores for the lm data combinations against plot synopses
the size of synopses is very different from that of plot summaries
although synopses also focus on the major events of the story their larger size allows for a more rened description of lm events
additionally because maries are created with the same number of sentences of the corresponding synopsis higher scores are expected
from all algorithms lexrank clearly stands out with the highest scores for all metrics except for r for scripts
the combination was used in order to termine whether the inclusion of redundant content would prove the scores over the separate use of scripts or subtitles
however in all cases figure leads to worse scores when compared to scripts alone
the same behavior is observed when using subtitles except for support sets based methods support sets and kp centrality
for plot synopses the best scores are achieved by lexrank and per while for plot summaries the best scores are achieved by lexrank and lsa
by inspection of the summaries produced by each algorithm we observed that mmr chooses sentences with fewer words in comparison with all other algorithms mally leading to lower scores
overall the algorithms behave similarly for both subtitles and scripts


documentaries from all algorithms table lsa achieved the best results for and r along with lexrank for

it is important to notice that lsa also produces the summaries with the highest word count favoring recall

discussion news articles intend to answer basic questions about a ular event who what when where why and often how
their structure is sometimes referred to as inverted pyramid where the most essential information comes rst
typically the rst sentences provide a good overview of the entire article and are more likely to be chosen when composing the nal summary
although documentaries follow a narrative structure similar to lms they can be seen as more closely related to news than lms especially regarding their intrinsic informative nature
in spite of their different natures however summaries created by humans produce similar scores for all of them
it is possible to observe this behavior in figure
note that documentaries achieve higher scores than news articles or lms when using the original subtitles documents against the corresponding ual plot summaries
fig
rouge scores for news articles lms and taries against manual references plot summaries and synopses and plot summaries respectively
figure presents an overview of the performance of each summarization algorithm across all domains
the results cerning news articles were the best out of all three datasets for all experiments
however summaries for this dataset preserve approximately of the original articles in terms of tences which is signicantly higher than for lms and mentaries which preserve less than necessarily leading to higher scores
nonetheless we can observe the differences in behavior between these domains
notably documentaries achieve the best results for plot summaries in comparison with lms using scripts subtitles or the combination of both
the relative scores on the lms dataset are inuenced by two jor aspects the short sentences found in the lms dialogs and since the generated summaries are extracts from subtitles and scripts they are not able to represent the lm as a whole in contrast with what happens with plot summaries or synopses
additionally the experiments conducted for for lms in general do not improve scores above those of scripts alone except for support sets for
overall lsa performed consistently better for news articles and documentaries
similar relatively good behavior had already been observed for meeting recordings where the best summarizer was also lsa
one possible reason for these results is that lsa tries to capture the relation between words in sentences
by inferring contextual usage of text based on these relations high scores apart from are produced for and r
for lms lexrank was the best performing algorithm for subtitles scripts and the bination of both using plot synopses followed by lsa and support sets for plot summaries
mmr has the lowest scores for all metrics and all datasets
we observed that sentences closer to the centroid typically contain very few words thus leading to shorter summaries and the corresponding low scores
interestingly by observing the average of and it is possible to notice that it follows very closely the ues of r
these results suggest that r adequately reects the scores of both and capturing the concepts derived from both unigrams and bigrams
overall summaries considering plot documentaries achieved higher results in comparison with lms
however in general the highest score for these two domains is achieved using lms scripts against plot synopses
note that synopses have a signicant difference in terms of sentences in parison with plot summaries
the average synopsis has sentences while plot summaries have on average sentences for lms and for documentaries
this gives synopses a clear advantage in terms of rouge recall based scores due to the high count of words

conclusions and future work we analyzed the impact of the six summarization algorithms on three datasets
the newspaper articles dataset was used as a reference
the other two datasets consisting of lms and mentaries were evaluated against plot summaries for lms and documentaries and synopses for lms
despite the different nature of these domains the abstractive summaries created by humans used for evaluation share similar scores across rics
the best performing algorithms are lsa for news and umentaries and lexrank for lms
moreover we conducted experiments combining scripts and subtitles for lms in order to assess the performance of generic algorithms by inclusion of redundant content
our results suggest that this combination is unfavorable
additionally it is possible to observe that all algorithms behave similarly for both subtitles and scripts
as previously mentioned the average of the scores follows closely the values of r suggesting that r is able to capture concepts derived from both unigrams and bigrams
we plan to use subtitles as a starting point to perform video summaries of lms and documentaries
for lms the results from our experiments using plot summaries show that the marization of scripts only marginally improved performance in comparison with subtitles
this suggests that subtitles are a viable approach for text driven lm and documentary marization
this positive aspect is compounded by their being broadly available as opposed to scripts
