v i x r a trivergence of probability distributions at glance juan manuel torres morenoa alaboratoire informatique davignon uapv bp france becole polytechnique montral montral qubec canada abstract in this paper we introduce the intuitive notion of trivergence of probability distributions tpd
this notion allow us to calculate the similarity among triplets of objects
for this computation we can use the well known measures of probability divergences like kullback leibler and jensen shannon
gence measures may be used in information retrieval tasks as automatic text summarization text classication among many others

introduction a statistical distance denes a measure of distance between two objects
this measure of distance may be interpreted as a distance among two probability distributions of two populations
moreover a metric is a measure dened on a set x as a function d such as x y x d x x
d respects the following conditions y ii y i iii y z y z several measures of distance are not considered as metrics because they do not fulll one or more of these conditions
these measures are known as gences
this is the case of kullback leibler divergence dkl that in particular violates the conditions ii and
in other hands the jensen shannon gence djs is a metric
it corresponds to the symmetrical version of the dkl divergence

the main idea is based on intuitive properties of divergences
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section we outline the vergences using probability distributions and smoothing
section introduces the preliminaries of notion of trivergence
sections and compute the trivergence as a product of divergences and as a compound divergence function
finally section shows the discussion and the conclusions

preliminaries divergences of probability distributions with thing in the follows we recapitulate the divergence functions of probability butions the kullback leibler divergence and the jensen shannon rical divergence


kullback leibler divergence the divergence of kullback leibler or relative entropy is a distance between two probability distributions p and q is dened by the equation log x wp the logarithm is in base but we adopted the notation convention as log
of course qw for a few items w because not all items of p are in q
in this case expressions like p log may occur if qw i
e
when the item w q see by example the figure
to avoid this situation in an empirical way a smoothing process is used for estimating the probability of unseen items
in the literature there are several smoothing techniques for example good turing back o

in this paper we will use a very elementary smoothing qw c q w if w q elsewhere where p and q are the probability distributions cp qw is dened by equation c p w is the number of ocurrences of the item w q total number of distinct items p total number of distinct items q and
in other hands we assume that then the divergence is calculated from p to q
w is the number of ocurrences of the item w p c q w the kullback leibler distance is not a metric in a mathematical sense cause despite meeting that with equality if and only if p q it is not symmetrical and it does not respect the triangle inequality


jensen shannon divergence the jensen shannon or symmetrical distance of kullback leibler between two probability distributions p and over the same alphabet x is ned by the equation log x wx x wx log with the same conventions for p q qw c p w as in equation and the same elementary smoothing
the logarithm is also in base but djs is a metric in a mathematical we adopted the same convention for
sense
w and c q
trivergence of probability distributions in order to dene the trivergence between three probability distributions we will use divergence measures
let p q and r be three probability distributions and t p r with cardinality
figure shows the partitioning of the t set in regions
we dened two ways to calculate the trivergence as a product of gences and as a compound divergence function product of divergences compound divergence function d d d d d d d d d d d d in both cases if we use the following restriction the denition of trivergence is in particular sorted by their cardinality
then we have for the product figure decomposition of the distributions p q and r in subsets
and for the compound function d in order to clarify the weight of the smoothing equation for qw and rw from figure we have for each region that
r
p qw

p q r rw

in this paper we will use both kullback leibler dkl and jensen shannon djs divergences in order to calculate the trivergence

conclusions log log log log if log log if the main contribution of this paper is the formalisation of the denition of smoothed trivergence of probability distributions tpd
the trivergence of three objects represented as probability distributions was calculated using elementary functions of divergence kl and js
we have proposed two ways to compute the smoothed tpd
the rst one uses a product of divergences and the second one uses a compound divergence function
divergences measures hase been used in automatic text summarization tasks among many others
