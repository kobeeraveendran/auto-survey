v i x r a it abstract due to the large amount of textual information available on internet is of paramount relevance to use techniques that nd relevant and concise content
a typical task devoted to the identication of informative sentences in documents is the so called extractive document summarization task
in this paper we use complex network concepts to devise an extractive multi document summarization mds method which extracts the most central sentences from several textual sources
in the proposed model texts are represented as networks where nodes represent sentences and the edges are established based on the number of shared words
differently from previous works the identication of relevant terms is guided by the acterization of nodes via dynamical measurements of complex networks including symmetry accessibility and absorption time
the evaluation of the proposed system revealed that excellent results were obtained with particular dynamical measurements including those based on the exploration of networks via random walks
index terms automatic summarization complex networks network measurements sentence extraction
i
introduction the large amount of information generated every single day has motivated the creation of automatic methods to classify understand and present the information in a clear and concise way
automatic summarization techniques are one of the many solutions to address the problem of managing large volumes of data
such methods aim at creating a compressed version of one or more texts by extracting their most important content
automatic summarization techniques are divided into two groups extractive summarization and abstractive tion
extractive summaries are produced by concatenating several sentences
such sentences are selected exactly as they appear in the original document
on the other hand abstractive summarization is a more difcult task since it includes paraphrasing sections of the source document
in addition abstractive methods may reuse clauses or phrases from original documents
in this paper we focus our analysis on the extractive version of summarization techniques
traditional techniques to select relevant sentences include the analysis of word frequency sentence clustering and machine learning
of particular interest to the aims of this paper are the methods based on complex networks
in recent years studies in complex networks have drawn enormous attention since networked models have been useful to model several real world phenomena
complex networks are graphs with certain statistical and topological properties which are not common in simple and random graphs
these properties are observed in world scale free and modular networks
complex network concepts have proven suitable to analyze texts in several applications including those devoted to create informative extractive summaries from one or more documents
such networks can capture text structure in several ways
nodes can represent words sentences or paragraphs of a document and the edges between nodes are established in different ways
according to some particular measurements nodes e

sentences receive a relevance score which in turn is used to select as a criterion to select a subset of the best ranked sentences to compose the nal extract
in our method with the aim of making a summary from a set of documents on the same topic mds we represent nodes as sentences and network edges are established according to a similarity based on the number of shared terms between two sentences
in addition to the traditional network measurements we used novel dynamical measurements to improve the acterization of the obtained complex networks
the summaries were produced for the cstnews which comprises documents in brazilian portuguese
the evaluation was carried out by using the metric
here we show that informative sentences can be retrieved via dynamical network measurements based on random walks as revealed by the excellent performance obtained mostly with measures ing the dynamical behavior of complex networks
the most prominent dynamical measurements were the accessibility the absorption time and the pagerank
this paper is organized as follows section ii contains a brief survey of works that use complex networks for extractive summarization
in section iii we detail the methodology which includes a description of the proposed network model and the networks measurements used to select the best ranked sentences to compose the summary
in section iv the results the conclusions and are presented and discussed
finally prospects for future work are shown in section v
ii
related work several works addressing extractive summarization based on graphs and complex networks measurements have been proposed
in the work of antiqueira et al
nodes resent sentences and an edge connect two sentences if they share signicant lemmatized nouns
then in order to give a numerical value to each node some complex network measurements are applied
the best ranked nodes sentences are selected to compose the nal extract
antiqueira et al
also implemented a summarizer based on a voting tem which combines the results of summaries generated by different measurements
the temario corpus was used to evaluate the results
some of the proposed systems achieved similar results compared to the top summarizers for brazilian portuguese
leite and rino explored multiple features using chine learning
the authors took into account supor features which is a supervised summarizer for brazilian portuguese and features based on complex network surements
in order to compose the extract using a machine learning perspective each sentence was classied as present or not present in summary
leite and rino also used temario corpus to evaluate the results obtaining excellent results
ribaldo et al
addressed the multi document marization mds task for texts in brazilian portuguese
all sentences from the corpus were identied and modeled as a single network
the pre processed sentences were represented as nodes which were linked by similarity measurements
to select the best ranked sentences the authors used the degree clustering coefcient and the shortest paths measurements
to create a summary devoid of redundancy the authors proposed a method to remove sentences with same content
the uation of results was performed on the cstnews brazilian corpus
the reported results showed that their method for portuguese mds yielded very good results which were close to the best system available for the language
in the work of amancio et al
networks are created as follows each lemmatized word is represented as a single node and edges are obtained by joining nodes whose corresponding words are immediately adjacent in the text
each edge weight is determined by the number of repeated associations between two words
after building a network several measurements strength shortest paths betweenness vulnerability and sity are computed at the word level
for sentence selection each sentence receives a weight based on the average weight of its content words
finally the n best weighted sentences are included in the nal summary
the authors found that diversity based measurements outperformed the best system proposed in
in the work of salton et al
text paragraphs are represented as nodes and edges are established between two nodes according to a similarity measure based on the number of shared words
routing algorithms such as bushy and depth rst paths were used to select the most important paragraphs
the algorithms were evaluated using a corpus of documents in english
the best algorithm selected
of paragraphs chosen by human summarizers
mihalcea dened a network of sentences which are connected according to the number of terms they share
to select the most informative sentences mihalcea used mendation algorithms for web pages including both google s page rank and hits
three network types were considered undirected forward edges reecting the reading ow of text and backward edges going from the current to the previous word in the text
the evaluation was performed on the english corpus and the portuguese temario
the results of the hits algorithms were superior to the best system when both forward and backward networks were used
for the portuguese scenario the backward network evaluated by the page rank algorithm provided the best performance
iii
methodology in the current paper we propose a method based on complex network measurements for portuguese multi document marization mds
we make an extension of antiqueira et al
and ribaldo et al
works by using new dynamical work measurements to characterize complex networks
each extracted sentence from documents is represented by a node and the edges are created if two sentences are semantically similar
this proposal is divided into ve stages document pre processing sentence vectorization network creation plication of network measurements and summarization i
e
sentence selection
a
document pre processing in order to model sentences as network nodes a set of changes must be applied to the original texts
such changes include the elimination of unnecessary words and the mation of words into their canonical form
this stage includes text segmentation this stage divides texts into sentences
we consider as a sentence any text segment separated by a period exclamation or question mark
we used the python nltk library for the text segmentation
elimination of stopwords and punctuation marks for the elimination of unnecessary words we used a list of stopwords for portuguese
morphosyntactic labeling part of speech tagging is portant for word lemmatization and for the identication of all nouns composing a sentence
in this phase we used the mxpost tagger for portuguese
lemmatization in this phase we obtained the canonical form of each word with the aim of processing in the same canonical form different variations of a word
table i shows an example of the document pre processing stage
b
sentence vectorization we used the tf idf weighting for vector representation of sentences since this metric was employed with satisfactory sults for many nlp tasks
to get the vector of a sentence we calculate the tf idf value of each of its corresponding words where tf is the term frequency and idf is the inverse document frequency
table i example of the pre processing stage applied to a piece of text extracted from wikipedia
the rst column shows the original text divided into six sentences
in the second column we show the pre processed text and shared nouns between sentences are highlighted
original text divided into sentences
brazil is the largest country in south america
it is the world s fth largest country by both area and population
it is the largest country to have portuguese as an ofcial language and the only one in america
bounded by the atlantic ocean on the east brazil has a coastline of kilometers
it borders all other south american countries except ecuador and chile
brazil s economy is the world s ninth largest by nominal gdp of pre processed text brazil be large country south america be world ve large country area population be large country have portuguese ofcial language america bound atlantic ocean east brazil have coastline kilometer border south america country ecuador chile brazil economy be world nine large nominal gdp c
network creation this stage creates two network models for document resentation
the rst network hereafter referred to as noun based network follows the antiqueira s work
the second variation of network hereafter referred to as tf idf based network is based on ribaldo s work
the particularities of these models are noun based network in this model each node represents a sentence comprising lemmatized nouns
there is an edge between two sentences when there is at least one noun in common between such sentences
the number of word repetitions between both sentences indicates the edge weight linking the sentences
tf idf based network to create this network we rst need to determine the tf idf vector representation of each document sentences
then each node network is represented by a sentence and the edge between two sentences is based on the similarity between the tf idf vectors of both sentences
the similarity is computed as the cosine similarity obtained from the tf idf vectors
figure shows an example of the two network models proposed in this work which were generated from the example in table i

d
application of network measurements in this stage we use a set of network measurements with the aim of giving a value of importance weight to each node
this weight allows us to rank the nodes so that the the best ranked sentences nodes compose the nal summary
every network measurement is used in an individual way therefore there is one summary for each measurement
in addition to the traditional network measurements degree strength shortest paths clustering coefcient betweenness and page rank we used additional measurements to take into account not only the topological structure of the networks but also their dynamical behavior
this can be achieved by considering dynamical processes occurring on the top of the networks
for simplicity sake we considered variation of random walks to study the dynamical behavior of the networks
such a dynamics gives rise to a series of measurements including concentric metrics accessibility symmetry and absorption time
the metrics employed in this work are detailed below
degree the degree of a vertex i is the number of edges connected to that vertex
strength for weighted networks the strength of a vertex i is the sum of the weights of its corresponding edges
clustering coefcient it is a measure to characterize the presence of loops of order three in a network
it measures the probability that two neighbors of a node are connected
shortest paths a shortest path between two vertices i and j is one of the paths dij that connects these vertices with a minimum length
the length of a path is determined by the number of edges connecting the vertices i and j
the similarity between distances is converted to distances using two distinct rules ij if or wij and ij if or ij wmax wij if ij wij if where wij is an element of the weighted matrix w representing the edges weight i
e
the original similarity indexes and and are the obtained distances
betweenness this measure is normally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between two nodes passing through some node of interest
page rank in this measurement a node i is relevant if it is connected to other relevant nodes
concentric measurements this type of measurement resents a set of eight indexes that are able to extract valuable topological information along hierarchical levels of networks
a hierarchical level allows a natural and powerful extension of basic measurements
the basic denition of any concentric measure relies on the cation of the ring i
e
the set of nodes which are d hops away from i
the following are some of the metrics that were proposed in the work of costa and silva concentric number of nodes number of nodes belonging to the ring
concentric number of edges number of edges connecting nodes inside the ring
concentric node degree number of edges extending from the ring to
concentric clustering coefcient division of the number of existing edges in the ring by the total number of possible edges in this ring
convergence ratio ratio between the concentric node degree and the number of nodes at the next concentric ring
intra ring node degree it is the average degree of the nodes at the ring considering only the edges located in the ring
inter ring node degree it is the ratio between the node degree and the number of nodes in the same ring
concentric common degree the average degree considering all the connections of nodes at a specic ring
accessibility the accessibility quanties the number of nodes actually accessible from an initial node
to calculate this measure consider that p j represents the probability of reaching a vertex j from i through a self avoiding random walk of length h
this measure considers the paths from the vertex i to each of the vertices located in the concentric ring of distance h and it is calculated as exp p j log p j j generalized accessibility because the accessibility surement depends on the parameter h a new version of accessibility can be considered without such a parameter
the generalized accessibility is based on a matrix nential operation
this operation allows the calculation of transition probabilities considering walks of all lengths between any pair of vertices
this measurement has been employed with sucess in other text classication tasks
symmetry the network symmetry is a normalized sion of accessibility where the number of accessible nodes is used as normalization factor
to calculate this measure concentric random walks are used as a way to avoid transitions to previous concentric levels
therefore changes must be made in the network so that the transitions do not use edges within a same concentric level
these changes originate two types of symmetry backbone symmetry and merged symmetry
in the backbone symmetry the edges that connect nodes belonging to the same concentric level are disregarded
in the merged symmetry these edges have cost and the nodes connected by them are collapsed
the symmetry is calculated as i p j log p j i where p j is the probability of reaching a node j from node i through a self avoiding random walk of i length h and is the set of accessible nodes that are at a distance h from the node i
the objective of using this measurement is to determine if nodes with a higher degree or lower degree of symmetry are good indicators of sentence importance
we tested this metric by selecting nodes with greater and lower symmetry
absorption time this metric is dened as the time it takes for a particle in an internal node to reach an output node through a random walk
the absorption time quanties how fast a randomly walking particle is absorbed by the output vertices assuming that the particle starts the random walk at the input node
according to this measurement sentences with lower absorption time are probably the appropriate sentences to form part of the summary
table ii summarizes the adopted network measurements for this work and how they are going to be used for summarization purposes

summarization in this stage the best ranked sentences are selected to compose the summary
in the rst place generated summaries must respect a established size
this size is adapted according to the size of references summaries
generally summaries have a compression rate of of the original text
also for mds it is important to avoid redundancy in the selected sentences
redundancy could occur when identical or similar sentences are represented in the graph as different nodes and it is frequently indicated by links with very high degree of similarity
in this paper we use the redundancy method proposed by ribaldo et al

in this work it is set a redundancy limit that a new selected sentence may have in relation to any of the previously selected tences
if this limit is reached this new sentence is considered redundant and it is ignored and the summarization process goes to the next candidate sentence otherwise the sentence is included in the summary
ribaldo et al
dened this limit as the sum of the highest and the lowest cosine similarity between all sentences of the original texts
iv
results in this section we show the achieved results from the evaluation of our systems for portuguese multi document summarization mds
we used the cstnews which is a set of documents that were extracted from on line brazilian news agencies
this corpus contains news items which are divided into clusters
each cluster contains or documents on the same topic
our systems were evaluated by using the metric which compares the erated summaries and the human generated summaries from cstnews
this metric was used because it has been shown that there is a strong correlation between rouge indexes and manual human judgement
for comparison purposes table iii shows the results from other works that achieved the best results for mds gistsumm which was the rst mds system produced for portuguese cstsumm which follows a cst based method cross document structure theory mead that is based on centroids sentence position and lexical features extracted from the sentences and bushypath and path systems which adapt the relationship map approach for mds
in this paper in table iii list of works for portuguese mds with the respective average recall scores
systems gistsumm bushypath path cstsumm



systems mead top baseline random baseline


order to compare our systems with other works shown in table iii and two baselines we show in table iv the average recall scores obtained from the proposed systems
with the aim of generating baseline summaries the rst baseline called top baseline selects the rst n sentences of the source document while the random baseline randomly selects sentences from the source document
in this work two experiments were carried out
in the rst approach we make a simple selection of best ranked sentences without using the anti redundancy detection method ard
in the second approach the ard method is used
the results in table iv show that applying anti redundancy detection ard methods does not have a big impact on the summary quality
we can see that ard methods had a slightly better performance than the simple sentence selection method
in some cases the results obtained without the ard method outperformed the ones obtained with such a ltering of sentences
we could conclude there is not great relevance in applying the adopted ard methods for the cstnews corpus
it remains therefore to be probed in future works the efciency of other methods for elimination of redundant sentences
the proposed methods achieved a good performance since they outperformed the majority of the results from other works for mds
we evaluated the noun and tf idf based networks
both networks displayed a similar performance
according to table iv traditional network measurements like degree shortest paths page rank betweenness and some of their weighted versions yielded the best scores
the measurements based on the dynamical behavior of the networks such as sorption time and generalized accessibility measurements also displayed an excellent performance
the backbone symmetry table iv r results for portuguese mds
in in the rst two columns is shown the performance of our systems without using the anti redundancy detection method ard
in last columns is shown the results by using the anti redundancy detection method ard
results in blue represent the best systems while those in orange represent the worst systems

measurement h achieved a good performance when the least symmetric nodes were taken into account in other cases however symmetry measurements yielded very low rouge scores
the accessibility measurement was outperformed by the top baseline score when it was evaluated at the second hierarchical level
such a performance decreased when further hierarchical levels were taken into account
finally the tems based on concentric and clustering measurements yielded the lowest results
v
final remarks in this paper we probed the efciency of several plex networks measurements for the multi document tive summarization task
we used novel dynamical complex networks metrics such as absorption time and generalized accessibility which achieved excellent scores
our results suggest that such measurements could be used to improve the characterization of networks for the summarization task as they complement the traditional analysis using a dynamical point of view
because all these measurements are based on a random walk with distinct preferential strategies we believe that such a walk should be further explored in further works
in order to improve the summary quality it would be important to use more sophisticated methods to represent documents as d

these methods include for example word dings to get a better representation of texts
also in another approach the document set could be represented as a multilayer network where each network layer sponds to a different document of the group of documents
it would also be important to develop an approach that bines both traditional document summarization techniques and complex network concepts
for example methods based on machine learning could be combined with traditional features like sentence length proper nouns or sentence location
