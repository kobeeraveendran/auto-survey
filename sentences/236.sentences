v i x r a abstract information has incorporating related text proven successful in stock market prediction
however it is a huge challenge to utilize texts in the enormous forex foreign currency change market because the associated texts are too redundant
in this work we propose a bert based hierarchical aggregation model to summarize a large amount of nance news to predict forex movement
we rstly group news from different aspects time topic and category
then we extract the most crucial news in each group by the sota extractive summarization method
finally we conduct interaction between the news and the trade data with attention to predict the forex ment
the experimental results show that the category based method performs best among three grouping methods and outperforms all the baselines
besides we study the inuence of essential news attributes category and gion by statistical analysis and summarize the inuence patterns for different currency pairs
introduction deep learning and natural language processing technologies have been widely applied in market prediction tasks strau et al
alostad and davulcu li et al
ni et al
and the market related nance news has proven very useful for the prediction ding et al
xu and cohen
however the studies of tion in forex market which is the largest market in the world with the highest daily trading volume is much less than that in the stock market
ure shows the average numbers per hour of forex related news
there is a large amount of nance news related to forex trading with different ence so it is a huge challenge to extract the useful semantic information from news
most of ous works bakhach et al
shen and liang this work is done when deli chen is a intern at mizuho securities
figure average numbers per hour of forex related news from reuters in
us eu represents news related to us europe or both of them
pradeepkumar and ravi contreras et al
weeraddana et al
on forex diction ignore related text totally and focus on the forex trade data only which loses the important mantic information
yet existing works seifollahi and shajari nassirtoussi et al
ing nance news in forex prediction mainly rely on manual rules to build feature vectors which can hardly access the semantic information effectively
to make better use of nance news we propose a novel neural model bert based hierarchical gregation model bham to summarize a large amount of nance news for forex movement diction
we suppose that the nance news is dundant and only a small amount of news plays a crucial role in forex trading
so the key point in is how to extract the most important news
bham we design a hierarchical structure to tract essential news at the group level rst and then aggregate the semantic information across all groups
we expect the news is more related group and less related inter groups to make the traction more effective
we design three grouping methods from different aspects time topic or egory
at the group level we concatenate news headlines in the same group and regard news traction in each group as an extractive tion task
we modify the sota extractive marization model proposed in liu to select the most important news
the connection process can let the selected news both content aware and context aware
followingly we conduct modal interaction between news data and trade data through attention mechanism to predict the forex prediction
the trade data represents the tory movement of the forex and the news data resents the environment variable
these two types of information are highly related
we conduct experiments on four major currency pairs usd eur usd jpy usd rmb gbp and the experimental results show that the category based bham performs best among all the baselines and proposed methods in all currency pairs
based on this method we analyze the ence of input time and prediction time on forex trading
we also analyze the inuence of news category and news region and nd various ence patterns for different currency pairs which may be enlightening to the forex investors
the main contributions of this works are summarized as follows we design a novel neural model to rate nance news in forex movement tion
to the best of our knowledge this is the rst work to use the neural model to rize a large amount of news for forex ment prediction
we propose three news grouping methods from different aspects time topic and egory
experiments show that the category based method performs best and outperforms all the baselines
based on our experiments we study the fect of time parameters on forex trading
we also analyze and summarize different ence patterns of nance news both category and region on different currency pairs
related work bert devlin et al
is a potent trained contextualized sentence representation and has proven obvious improvement for many nlp tasks sun et al
xu et al

liu proposes a modied bert for extractive rization and achieve the state of the art result in extractive document summarization task
there have been many studies applying the lated text in market prediction tasks
moreover the text assisted stock movement prediction has tracted many researchers interest
most of these works predict stock movement based on single news si et al
utilize the sentiment analysis to help the prediction
duan et al
adopt the summarization of news body instead of headline to predict
ding et al
propose the driven event embedding method to make the cast
yet some others choose multi news hu et al
propose a hybrid attention network to bine news in different days
however the number of combined news is still limited and much smaller than that of forex news
compared to stock prediction works about forex prediction is much scarce and most of these works al
bakhach et al
yong et al
roledene et al
contreras et al
weeraddana et al
do not consider the text information
shen and liang employ stacked autoencoder to get the trade data representation and adopt support vector regression to predict
de almeida et al
combine svm with genetic algorithms to optimize investments in forex markets based on history price
tsai et al
choose the volutional neural network to process the trading data
besides only limited works utilize the forex related text in the prediction process
nassirtoussi et al
adopt the wordnet miller and sentiwordnet baccianella et al
to tract the text semantic and sentiment information and build the text feature vector to forecast forex movement
following this work seifollahi and shajari add word sense disambiguation in the sentiment analysis of news headlines
vijayan and potey apply the algorithm in alyzing text
this kind of method pays more tention to access a xed feature vector from news and can only represent news on a shallow level
in this work we propose a selection and aggregation neural framework to process the larger amount of nance news and employ the powerful pre trained bert as text encoder which can learn the deep semantic information effectively
approach
problem formulation each sample in the dataset y contains the set of news text the forex trade data y and the forex movement label
and y happen in the same input time window
to be more specic is a list of news groups
l is the number of groups
the methods for figure the overview of the proposed model
figure the bert input in each news group
data representation to predict the forex movement
dividing groups are introduced in section

each news group is a sequence of nance news in chronological der
y is the trade data embedding accessed by the method introduced in section

and is the forex movement label telling whether the forex trade price is up or down after a certain time we call it prediction delay
the forex movement prediction task can be dened as assigning ment label for the news input and trade data input

model overview the overview of the bert based hierarchical gregation model bham is displayed in ure
the model can be generally divided into two steps group extraction and groups aggregation
in the intra group extraction step news in the same group is connected as a continuous paragraph and we conduct extractive summarization on this paragraph to select the most important news
specically we employ bert as the encoder to get the contextualized paragraph representation and compute the importance score for each news
then we select and aggregate the top k k is a hyper parameters news to get the nal group representation
in the inter groups gregation step we rst access the trade data sentation by a layer perceptron and then employ the trade data representation as a query to late the attention scores of all the news group and obtain the nal news representation
finally we fuse the nal news representation and the trade
intra group extraction there will be lots of news in the same group and we suppose that only a small amount of news has the greatest inuence on the forex movement
the purpose of this step is to select the essential news from all news in group which is redundant and inspired by the bert based full of noise
tractive summarization model proposed in liu we modify this method to select the most crucial news in each group
all the news in the same group is related to the subject of this group and the connection of them in chronological order can be regarded as the continuous description of the group subject
the connection can make the news representations realize the context tion of this group by passing information among different news
we suppose the context tion can help select better news in group
the form of group news input for bert coder is illustrated in figure
we insert a cls token before each news and a sep token after each news
for the segment embedding we use the loop of ea eb to extend the raw segment embedding of bert to multi sentences
after the bert encoding all the cls tokens cls are garded as the semantic representations of the responding news
the importance score for each multi layer score inputtrade data inputmovementpredictionfx news attentiongroup newstoken embeddingsposition embeddingssegment news is calculated base on these cls tokens scorei clsi ti where i l l is the number of groups
clsi is the list of cls tokens in the th group
and are the trainable parameters
scorei is a list of values indicating the important scores of news
topk is an operation to select the top k pieces of news with the highest scores
then the group representation is calculated by the weighted sum of the top k cls tokens gi clsi j j the gi is the nal representation of the i th news group which contains the semantic information from the most important news in this group

inter groups aggregation the purpose of this step is to aggregate semantic information at the inter groups level
the forex trade data and the nance news are highly vant the trade data represents the history ment of forex and the nance news represents the environmental variable
so the combination of them can help us model the forex movement ter
in a certain input time news groups have ferent impacts on forex movement
so we employ the trade data as a query to calculate the attention weights of news groups
then the weighted sum of news groups and the trade data representation are nally fused to predict the forex movement
for forex trade data we apply a layer tron to access the trade data representation rt and each layer is a non linear transform with relu tivation function
then we calculate the attention weight between rt and gi wa atti where is the i th news group s attention weight to trade data
then we sum the news groups representations up to get the nal news mantic representation rs to fuse the news semantic and trade data sentations effectively we choose the fusion tion used in wang et al
mou et al
to fuse rs and rt and predict the movement r rt rs rt rs rt rs y r bp means element wise multiplication

methods of grouping news in this part we introduce the three news ing methods
the ideal division enables news groups to be high cohesion and low coupling which means the semantic information of nance news should be highly related intra group and less related inter groups
we suppose that extracting news by groups can reduce the extraction difculty compared to extracting from all news directly cause news in the same group is close to each other and has less noise
moreover this method can help us analyze the contributions of different groups


grouping by time in this method nance news is divided into groups according to the time when news happens
we set the time unit to minutes and news released in the same time unit will be divided into the same group
this method supposes that news happened closely is highly correlated


grouping by topic in this method nance news is divided into groups by news topic
the news topics are generated by unsupervised news clustering
in this work we choose the afnity propagation algorithm frey and dueck to generate news clusters out setting the number of clusters subjectively
moreover we choose the tf idf of gram features from news headlines
this method supposes that nance news focuses on several nance event ics at a particular time
news in the same topic describes this topic from different aspects and has a high correlation


grouping by category in this method news is divided into groups are the news by category
business sectors business general ness assets business commodities business affairs organizations rs gi atti l the reuters professional nancial news
reuters
com topic codes and merge some similar categories
science technology other
this method supposes that news in the same category is close to each other

trade data embedding the raw record of forex data includes the close high low trade prices for each minute
in der to extract all the possible features we build the trade data embedding y containing multi aspects raw number open close high low trade price for each trade minute
change rate change rate of open high low price compared to last trade minute
trade statistics mean value max value min value median variance of all the trade prices in input minutes
the min max scale is applied for each currency pair s samples to scale the raw numbers in y to according to the maximum and minimum value of each feature

training objective the loss function of the proposed model includes two parts the negative log likelihood training loss and the regularization item loss f log y is the model parameters
experiments show that the performance improves after adding larization
we train three models with different news grouping methods time topic and category and we call them bham time bham topic bham category respectively
experiment
dataset the experiment dataset is accessed from the fessional nance news providers
we collect forex trade data of four major currency pairs usd eur usd jpy usd rmb gbp from to
we collect the open close high low trade price for each trade minute
as for the nance news data we collect all the english news happened in trade time leased by reuters and match the news with target currency pairs according to news region
for ample we match usd eur with news related to us europe or both of them
the raw data contains both news headline and body and we utilize the headline only since the headline contains the most valuable information and has less noise
the forex movement label f is decided by the comparison of prediction time price and the input window ing price
we design the symbol usd to represent the prediction for the usd eur exchange rate with minutes input time and minutes prediction delay
to access more data for training we overlap the input time of samples
for example when overlap rate is two utive samples input time will be am and am
then the data samples will be twice as large as no overlap condition in the dataset the number of samples will increase from to
we reserve samples for developing and samples for testing
all the rest of samples are applied for training

experiment setting we choose the pytorch pretrained as bert implement and choose the bert uncased version in which there are layers hidden states and attention heads in the former
we truncate the bert input to tokens and ne tune the bert parameters during ing
we adopt the adam kingma and ba optimizer with the initial learning rate of

we apply the dropout srivastava et al
ularization with the dropout probability of
to reduce
the batch size is
the training epoch is with early stop
the weight of regularization is

the learning rate begins to decay after epoch
the overlap rate of data samples is and the number of lected news in each group is
when splitting the dataset we guarantee that the samples in train set are previous to samples in valid set and test set to avoid the possible information leakage
we tune the hyper parameters on the development set and test model on the test set
the forex prediction is conducted as a binary classication task up or down
the evaluation metrics are macro and matthews correlation coefcient mcc
mcc is often reported in stock movement forecast xu and cohen ding et al
because it can overcome the data imbalance issue

html pytorch pretrained bert results and analysis
comparison with baselines here we introduce the baselines in this work
since there are few existing works we modify two advanced models from stock prediction eld which adopt multi news as input for this task
sides we design some ablation variations of the proposed model to check the effects of different modules
the baselines are shown below nonews this method considers the forex trade data only and use a layer perceptron the setting is same as full model to encode the trade data and make prediction
this is a baseline to check the improvement by adding text information
svm this method chooses the support tor machine to predict the result based on the feature vectors extracted by the method duced in seifollahi and shajari
han this method is proposed in hu et al
for stock movement prediction
it includes a hybrid attention mechanism and gated recurrent unit to combine multi day s stock news to predict movement
we use ery minutes instead of each day as time unit for this method and the stocknet method cause there is too much news for forex ing and the experiments show that the latest news has the most inuence
stocknet this method is proposed in xu and cohen
it treats the prediction task as a generation task and designs a variational auto encoder to process days tweets to predict stock movement
nogroup this method does not group news and select key news directly from all news
noconnect this method does not connect news in the same group
instead it gets the representation for each news independently using bert
this method groups news by category
this method uses the directional lstm and self attention to place the bert as text encoder
the ber of lstm hidden states is and the hidden layer is
this method groups news by category
as shown in table all the three proposed figure the bham category model s performances macro on usd jpy pair under different ditions of input time and prediction delay
the dark colour means low performance and light colour means high performance
methods perform well and both bham topic and bham category methods outperform all the baselines
the bham category performs best among these methods which shows that the mantic information of nance news is mostly aggregated by category
all the methods get improved after introducing the text information which proves the related nance news is helpful for the prediction
the performance of nogroup method decreases by a large margin compared to bham category which demonstrates that the hierarchical structure works well
without erarchical structure selecting essential news rectly from all news has more noise and requires the model to have a stronger tting ability for a longer paragraph
after removing the news nection the performance of noconnect method drops sharply compared to bham category
cessing the news representation from the nected paragraph helps the news representation alize the context information in the group
the method performs worse than the bert based method which proves that bert has stronger power of sentence encoding
the two methods borrowed from stock movement tion are designed to consider all news s mation but the forex related news is redundant which can explain the poor performance of these two methods

effect of time parameters in this section we analyze the inuence of time parameters on model two crucial time and formance which are input method nonews svm han stocknet nogroup noconnect bham time bham topic bham category usd eur mcc



















usd jpy mcc



















usd rmb mcc



















usd gbp mcc



















table results of baselines and proposed methods on the test set input time window is minutes and prediction delay is minutes we observe similar result in other time settings
all the experiment results have proven signicant with p
by student t test
time tion delay
we choose the input minutes the prediction delay minutes and periment all combinations
we take the jpy for example to analyze the time effect of forex trading and we observe similar results in other currency pairs
the figure shows category model s performances macro on usd jpy pair under different combinations of put time and prediction delay
we can observe that with the increase of input time from utes to minutes the model performance proves too
however when we increase the input time continuously the model performance begins to decrease
too less text is not enough to port the prediction but too many texts may bring much noise
the ideal input time is around minutes
besides at all input time conditions the model s performances decline with the increase of prediction delay because events happened in the prediction delay time may also inuence the forex movement
we can also conclude that forex ment pays more attention to the latest news cause when masking the latest news input such as usd and usd the latter one can be seen as the former one masking the lastest minutes input the model performance declines obviously at almost all conditions

inuence of news attributes in this section we analyze the inuence of nance news s attributes category and region on tion results and summarize the inuence patterns for different currency pairs
we conduct the periments based on bham category


effect of news category the forex trading data s attention weights over news categories are calculated by equation
we sum up all the attention weights of test samples and calculate the proportions each category tributes
as shown in figure we display the inuence patterns of news category for different currency pairs
we observe that there are vious differences among currency pairs
eur trading pays more attention to the business sectors and politics international affairs news
usd jpy trading is mostly inuenced by ness sectors and science technology news
itics international affairs news has the most nicant impact on usd rmb trading and ness commodities news effects usd gbp ing most
the summarized inuence patterns can serve as decision making reference for forex traders when facing news from various categories


effect of news region the trading data s attention weight for selected news attij is calculated by the following formula attij atti j where atti is the trade data s attention on the i th category in equation and j in equation is the weight of selected news in group
we sum up all the selected news s attention according to their gions and access the region inuence weight
the results are shown in figure
for each currency pair the news are divided into three classes news related to region a only news related to region b only and news related to both region a and b
and we observe that the news related to both region a and b has the least inuence on all currency figure the attention distributions over categories for different currency pairs
figure the attention distributions over regions for different currency pairs
usd eur usd jpy usd rmb usd gbp























table impact of selection number in each group in bham category
means keeping all news
the sults have proven statistic signicant
pairs
news related to the us has the largest uence weight on usd jpy and usd gbp ing
yet news related to china europe has a larger inuence weight than news related to us in rmb usd eup trading
we can intuitively serve the inuence weights of different regions for forex trading which is helpful for the analysis and forecast of forex movement

impact of selection number the selection number in each group is an tial hyper parameter to control the amount of tracted information
as shown in table the bham category performs best when the tion number is in all currency pairs
when the selection number is small the model is too strict so that some crucial information will be missed
when the selection number is large some less inuential news will be selected and terfere model s decision
when we keep all news in the group the model s performance declines by a large margin
this experiment demonstrates that the selection mechanism plays an important role in the proposed model
conclusion in this work we propose a bert based chical aggregation model to summarize a large amount of nance news for forex movement diction
experiments show that our model forms all the baselines by a large margin which proves the effectiveness of the proposed work
we design three grouping news ods time topic and category and experiments show that the category based method performs best which shows that the semantic information of forex related news is mostly aggregated by gory
experiments about time effect prove that the proper input time is about minutes and the diction accuracy declines with the increase of diction delay
besides we analyze the inuence of news attributes on forex trading and observe some interesting conclusions business sectors news has the most inuence on usd eur ing and politics international affairs news effects usd rmb trading most
besides both jpy trading and usd gbp trading pay most tention to news from us
all these inuence terns can help forex traders handle different news culture entertainment spotrsscience eur more wisely and make better decisions
to our knowledge this is the rst work to lize the advanced nlp pre train technology in the enormous forex market and the results show the potential of this research area
promising ture studies may include designing more suitable grouping methods or combining news grouping and market predicting in an model
