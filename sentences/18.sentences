com into sentences representative abstract this paper describes a computationally inexpensive and efficient generic summarization algorithm for arabic texts
the algorithm belongs to extractive summarization family which reduces the identification and problem extraction sub problems
important keyphrases of the document to be summarized are identified employing combinations of statistical and linguistic features
the sentence extraction algorithm exploits keyphrases as the primary attributes to rank a sentence
the present experimental work demonstrates different techniques for achieving various summarization goals including informative richness coverage of both main and auxiliary topics and keeping redundancy to a minimum
a scoring scheme is then adopted that balances between these summarization goals
to evaluate the resulted arabic summaries with well established systems aligned english arabic texts are used through the experiments

introduction a summary can be defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts that contains a significant portion of the information in the original text
as the number of electronic documents rapidly increases the need for automatic techniques to assess the relevance of documents materializes
summaries could be displayed in search engine web pages results as an informative tool for the user to find the relevant and desired information
summarization process can be classified according to many directives method granularity generality and information richness
in general there are two methods for automatic text summarization extractive and abstractive
extractive summarization involves copying significant units usually sentences of the original documents
the goal of abstraction summary is to produce summaries that read as text produced by humans
therefore abstraction summary may need the building of an internal semantic representation the use of natural language generation of the sentences compression techniques the reformulation or the use of new word sequences that are not present in the original document
these methods are still difficult to achieve
extractive summaries can have different granularity levels which reflect the size of text unit to be extracted starting from word phrase distribution and up to complete paragraph extraction
concerning generality of summaries two types can be distinguished generic summaries and query driven summaries
the first type tries to represent all relevant topics of a source text
the second type focuses on the user desired query keywords or topics
another classification of summaries is based on its information richness
indicative summaries give a brief idea of what the original text is about without conveying specific content
it is used to indicate important topics to quickly decide whether a text is worth reading
the second type is informative summaries which are intended to cover the topics in the source text to provide some shortened version of the content

in this paper we present a computationally inexpensive and efficient generic summarization technique that focuses on keyphrase based extractive summarization
keyphrases that are automatically extracted from a document text are used to evaluate the importance of each sentence in the document
although there are numerous techniques for sentence to changing extraction strategy to achieve one or more summarization goals
a human summarizer has the ability to select the sentences to be presented according to many factors the maximum allowed number of sentences to be displayed and the number of topics to be covered in the document

also a human summmarizer may change the selection strategy if it was noticed that the document contains equal important or main supplementary concepts
therefore the main objective of our work is to demonstrate constructs smaller keyphrases a more flexibility method in directing the proposed sentence extractor towards one or more summarization goals
the goals are level extraction little attention including language is paid using extract the most that capture main topics
this may be useful in extracting very short summary informative sentences eliminate the domination of main topic on output important for is particularly summary
this documents that contain main and supplementing topics
keep sentence redundancy to a minimum
this is an essential requirement for a summarizer to allow a room for other concepts to be presented in the output
cover all important topics of the document
for long documents this puts the lower limit of compression
achieve balance between all previous goals
it language independent however the presented keyphrase extraction and summarization is heuristics are implemented to extract summaries of arabic documents
to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that exploits automatically extracted keyphrases to produce arabic summaries
the remaining of this paper is organized as follows the related works is presented in section and a fast revision of the accurate arabic lemmatizer is presented in section
the efficiency of the summary is mainly determined by the keyphrase extraction sub system
therefore one of the main contributions of this work is the modification done to an existing arabic keyphrase extraction subsystem that helps to select the relevant sentences to be in the summary
in section the keyphrase extraction algorithm is reviewed
the paper proposes the use of new heuristics to identify significant sentences
each heuristic has its pros and cons that affect the summarization results
section discusses these effects and introduces a combined heuristic to achieve a balance between summarization goals
in keyphrase based summarization
related works the basic idea of the extraction is to create summaries using words phrases sentences and even paragraphs pulled directly from the source text using statistical and linguistic analysis
word level summary has been started as early as in the
luhn introduced a way for summarization based only on word distribution in the source document
this representation abstracts the source text into a frequency table
similar approaches still used today to generate tag cloud interface
the focus is to present nouns or adjective noun pairs frequently mentioned in the the second representation reviews with font size proportional to their number of occurrences
keyphrases are in abstraction hierarchy
keyphrases are defined as a short list of terms to provide condensed summary of the topics of a document where important words and phrases that express the main topics are extracted
davanzo
al
proposed the lake system to extract keyphrases
the summary that approximates the summarization
list of keyphrases is presented as level most of the extractive summarization techniques consider sentence as a basic extraction unit
earlier techniques were based on surface level features such as occurrence of cue phrase markers eg
in conclusion in summary other researchers rely on formatting attributes such as position of sentences bold texts or headers
another class of summarization depends on scoring sentences which takes many forms based on statistical syntactic or semantic attributes
relevance measure rm and latent semantic analysis lsa were used to score sentences
the motivation is to identify topics and evaluate the importance of these topics
lexical chaining algorithm is another way to group the words of a given text so that the words of each group has a close semantic relation the motivation is to identify topics and evaluate the importance of these topics
chains are created by taking a new text word and finding a related chain for it according to relatedness criteria
barzilay and elhadad introduced an algorithm to compute lexical chains in a text merging several knowledge sources such as wordnet thesaurus a part of speech tagger and shallow parser for the identification of nominal groups
the chain representation approach avoids selecting different terms having the same concept using wordnet problem because all these terms occur in the same chain which reflects that they represent the same concept
goldstein presented a summarizer for news article generated by sentence selection
sentences are directly ranked for potential inclusion in the summary using a weighted combination of statistical and linguistic features
an english domain specific sentence scoring technique was presented in
the system ranks a sentence based on sentence position keyphrase existence cue phrase existence sentence length and sentence similarity to document class
some research has treated sentence extraction as a learning problem training material this approach exemplifies extracted sentences by providing sentence features and selection flag
the study of sobh
al introduced an arabic classifier that is trained to extract important sentences directly based on many features such as sentence length
in interactive document summarizer sentence position in paragraph sentence similarity number of infinitives in sentence and number of verbs in sentences
an ids using automatically extracted keyphrases is introduced by steve et

keyphrases are extracted from a document using the kea keyphrase extraction algorithm
each sentence in each document is then awarded a score using a heuristic based on the frequency of the document s keyphrases in the sentence
a further characteristic of an interactive summarizer is the ability to bias the summary towards a particular topic or set of topics
the methods described above belong to a family of that rely on word phrase or sentence techniques distribution where concept is a single or multiple words
in salton et al
paragraphs are represented as vectors then the similarity between paragraphs is evaluated
a graph of paragraphs as nodes and the similarities as links is constructed
given a threshold for similarity the link between two paragraphs exists only if the similarity is above that threshold
the summarization is based on paragraph selection heuristics that selects paragraphs with many connections with other paragraphs and present them in text order

the proposed system in this paper we propose an algorithm that belongs to extractive summarization family which reduces the problem into a sentence scoring and extraction problems
instead of scoring sentences directly keyphrases are used as attributes to evaluate the sentence importance
the algorithm is based on the intuition that the keyphrases represent the most important concepts of the text
the proposed algorithm is different from directly scoring sentences through learning systems
these algorithms usually determine absolute importance for selecting a sentence which is not true in all cases since the importance is also determined by the allowed maximum limit of compression
the algorithm extracts keyphrases contained in a text to be summarized
based on the extracted keyphrases each sentence within the text is ranked
the output summary is formed by extracting the sentences into the summary in order of decreasing ranks up to the specified summary length or percentage
in the importance of a sentence is determined by different heuristics
the current work introduces four scoring heuristics for achieving summarization goals and shows the pros and cons for each
the proposed system both of the word representation granularity level and its extracted morpho syntactic features directly affect the performance of keyphrase extraction subsystem and hence the summarizer output
section reviews the lemma level arabic analyzer
next sections describe the two algorithm subsystems keyphrase extractor and sentence extraction

arabic language analyzer lemma representation arabic is very rich in categorizing words and hence numerous techniques have been developed to evaluate the suitable representation level of arabic words in ir systems
two levels have been debated root level and stem level
the main problem in selecting a root as a standard representation level in information retrieval systems is the over semantic classification
many words that do not have similar semantic interpretations are grouped into the same root
on the other hand stem level suffers from semantic classification
stem pattern may exclude many similar words sharing the same semantic properties
for example arabic broken plurals have stem patterns which differs from their singular patterns
in our work we devoted towards lemma form representation level of arabic words
lemma refers to the set of all word forms that have the same meaning and hence capture semantic similarities between words
on a word form conflation scale the minimum stem level and below the maximum root level
the keyphrase extractor used in our work is based on the existing arabic keyphrase extractor ake
the original linguistic processing of ake was based on an annotated arabic corpus
to improve ambiguity resolution of arabic pos tagging and increase the coverage scope of language analysis we have replaced the based module with an accurate root based lemmatizer module which achieves maximum accuracy of
and
for first seen documents
the input document is segmented into its constituent sentences based on the arabic phrases delimiter characters such as comma semicolon colon hyphen and dot
table shows part of the output of the lemmatizer
the accurate root based arabic lemmatizer performs the following tasks lies slightly above a extracts pos tagging of the document words
ambiguity is resolved using metadata about patterns roots and infixes indications of arabic words
transforms inflected word form to its dictionary canonical lemma form
for nouns and adjectives lemma form is the singular indefinite masculine if possible form and for verbs it is the perfective third person masculine singular form
features of the document words
the modifications to ake are c extracts relevant morpho syntactic features that replacement of based analyzer with support keyphrase extraction purposes

lemma based keyphrase extraction the first step of the proposed summarizer algorithm is to extract indicative keyphrases of the document at a lemma level
we employ the existing arabic keyphrase extractor system
the extractor is supplied with linguistic knowledge to enhance its efficiency instead of relying only on statistical information such as term frequency and distance
the main modification done to ake subsystem is the replacement of the annotated arabic with the accurate arabic lemmatizer to extract the required lexical lemma based analyzer
inclusion of latin words and unrecognized words in keyphrases they are treated as arabic nouns
c recognition of numerals
d adding new sets of syntax rules that limits allowed word category sequences in candidate keyphrases
the linguistic and statistical features are used to learn the linear discriminant analysis classifier to extract relevant the keyphrases
after modifications keyphrase extractor subsystem re evaluated
the modified lemma based arabic keyphrase extractor is based on three main steps linguistic processing candidate phrase extraction and feature vector calculation
the following sections review these steps
the output of is

candidate phrases extraction the second step of the kp extractor is to extract all possible phrases of one two or three consecutive words that appear in a given document as n gram terms
to extract effective candidate keyphrases n gram terms are then filtered according to syntactic rules that limits allowed pos sequences
table shows an example of the output grams candidate keyphrases
table sample of extracted grams keyphrases sentence
candidate phrases cp abstract form of cp

feature vector calculation each candidate phrase is then assigned a number of features used to evaluate its importance
the following features are adopted normalized phrase words npw which is the number of words in each phrase normalized to the maximum number of words in a phrase
the phrase relative frequency prf which represents the frequency of abstract form of the candidate phrase normalized by dividing it by the most frequent phrase in the given document
the word relative frequency wrf the frequency of the most frequent single abstract word in a candidate phrase excluding article words normalized by dividing the maximum number of repetitions of all phrase words in a given document
it by normalized sentence location nsl which measures the location of the sentence containing the candidate phrase within the document
normalized phrase location npl feature is adopted to measure the location of the candidate phrase within its sentence
normalized phrase length nplen which is the length of the candidate phrase in words divided by the number of words of its sentence
g sentence contain verb scv
this feature has a value of zero if the sentence of the candidate phrase contains verb
is it question iit this feature has a value of one if the sentence of the candidate phrase is written in a question form
in our work we use the same lda learning model of the corpus based arabic keyphrase extractor

evaluating lemma based arabic keyphrase extractor the web lemma based version with since we have changed the central language processing module of the keyphrase extractor it was necessary to reevaluate its performance
the performance of the proposed lemma based version of the arabic ke is evaluated in two experiments
the first experiment uses same dataset described in to compare the output keyphrases of those extracted by the based ake kp miner web link

table shows extracted keyphrases from the four systems
the results of the first experiment given in table show that the modified version of the keyphrase extractor has on average better performance than the based system in terms of precision and recall
the additional benefit we get is the increased language coverage of lemma based system
in the second experiment the data set is a parallel english arabic texts
aligned texts from english unicef publication and its corresponding arabic translation are used to compare extracted arabic keyphrases using the proposed keyphrase extractor to corresponding english extracted ones

arabic texts are fed to lemma based ake and kp miner while their corresponding english texts are fed to both of kea and extractor systems
kea identifies candidate keyphrases by computing feature values tfxidf the first occurrence which is the percentage of the document preceding the first occurrence of the term term length in words and node degree of a candidate phrase which is the number of phrases in the candidate set that are semantically related to this phrase

table english unicef sample document unicef humanitarian action and resilience guided by the convention on the rights of the child unicef in strengthened its core humanitarian policy to uphold the rights of children and women in crises
unicef reframed its core commitments for children cccs in emergencies as the core commitments for children in humanitarian action reflecting wider shifts in unicef s own work in these contexts as well as the organization s commitment to humanitarian reform
key changes include expanding the core commitments for children to include preparedness before the onset of a crisis and adopting an early recovery approach during response with disaster risk reduction integrated throughout
the core commitments for children also moved from a focus on activities to broader strategic results that link humanitarian action to the fulfillment of children s and women s rights in each of unicef s programme sectors
they also reflect the recognition that realizing these core commitments requires the contributions of a multitude of actors including clusters
thus reconceived unicef s humanitarian action offers a potential platform for supporting resilience at the national and community levels
a few recent examples illustrate how this has manifested in affected countries
the revised core commitments for children also tighten the link between humanitarian action and development
this stronger integration contributes to unicef s institutional flexibility the nimbleness with which our programmes adjust to evolving situations
in addition the sharpened focus on disaster risk reduction and local capacity development as explicit strategies contribute to communities own flexibility in the face of multiple shocks throughout the broader cycle of prevention response and recovery
in ethiopia unicef has ported disaster risk reduction through a led decentralized health extension programme to provide essential health and nutrition services
this programme has had a significant impact in the communities results show an increase in national treatment capacity of severe acute malnutrition from cases per month in to cases per month in
through the treatment of children suffering from malnutrition those with severe acute malnutrition can now be identified earlier and receive life saving treatment closer to home thus helping reduce children s vulnerability

sentence extraction the sentence extraction algorithm exploits keyphrases that are automatically extracted from document text as the primary attributes of a sentence
sentence ranking is determined by assigning scores to each sentence of the document based on extracted keyphrases
different scoring schemes are adopted to achieve one or more goals of summarization
the output summary is then formed by extracting the sentences into the summary in order of decreasing ranks up to the specified summary length or percentage
the proposed summarizer extracted sentences are sequentially presented in the same sequence as the original text to preserve the information flow
the four different subsections describe heuristics for scoring sentences based on keyphrases
for each document the top twelve extracted keyphrase are employed through the evaluation experiments
in all experiments a compression ratio is set to
following in
summing keyphrases heuristic once extracted keyphrases scores have been computed the next step of the algorithm is to score sentences
in the first heuristic scoring is based on summing scores for all lemma keyphrase forms that appear in the sentence
the summing heuristic is given by for each sentence s sum all the scores of lemma form keyphrases contained in s
find nss by normalizing sentences scores by the maximum score
sentences are then ranked based on their normalized summing scores nss and an percentage of sentences are extracted into a summary
the algorithm is greedy since it favors a sentence that contains many important concepts
for small percentage summarization the algorithm succeeds to capture minimum number of sentences that carry most important topics of the document
table shows the output summary of the sample document
table summary output based on nss


the main problems with summing based algorithm are its limited coverage and redundant sentence selections
a document usually consists of several topics
main topics are described by many sentences and hence have high scores
supplementing concepts are usually described by few sentences and hence have small scores
in summing based algorithm many sentences that describe same focus topic dominate the selection
all sentences containing the main topic will get higher scores which may lead to redundant sentences selection and does not provide a room for other topics to appear in the summary
we therefore defined a second heuristic based on counting keyphrases instead of summing their scores

counting keyphrases heuristic one solution to cover the major topics of the document as much as possible is to score sentences according to count of keyphrases instead of their scores
the counting heuristic is given by for each sentence s count all lemma form keyphrases contained in s find ncs by normalizing the sentence count scores by the maximum score
this gives equal importance to all keyphrases and hence concepts
sentences that have more keyphrases are extracted and put in a summary
table shows summarization result for counting score heuristic
table summary output based on ncs




the problem of it is noticed that the algorithm tends to select longer sentences because they are more likely to achieve high count scores
this may be useful for a summary where longer sentences tend to be more easily interpreted without surrounding context
topic count heuristic solves domination of the output summary
however it does not guarantee the avoidance of redundant topic selection
the same problem exists also with summing heuristic
some authors repeat important sentences in many parts of the document with little word variations
the problem was solved in previous work by adding a filter which removes redundant sentences based on cosine similarity measurement between all extracted sentences
in the current research we have another approach discussed in the third heuristic
main

keyphrase coverage oriented heuristic both of the previously described two heuristics are based on scoring sentences and do nt guarantee complete coverage of all concepts of the document for a summary length
also very similar sentences can be extracted
the coverage heuristic is given by for each lemma form of keyphrase k increment the score of the first sentence containing k find nks by normalizing the sentence key scores by the maximum score
in the coverage oriented algorithm only one sentence is extracted for each keyphrase
it starts by high score keyphrases extract the sentence that contains the first appearance of this keyphrase to summary if it is not already exist
in this heuristic only one sentence at most is extracted for each keyphrase
the algorithm covers all the major topics of the document and at the same time keeping redundancy to a minimum
table shows the resultant summary
table summary output based on merging heuristic
table summary output based on nks



merging heuristics the fourth heuristic merges different scoring techniques to achieve a balance between summarization goals
this should lead to further improvement of the source text abstraction
the scoring of merging heuristic is formed by summing previous normalized scores this is given by merging score nss ncs nks evaluating automatic text summarization systems is not a straightforward process since it is an elusive property
since there are no arabic standard summarization documents we compare extracted arabic sentences with existing well established extractor system
the following procedures are adopted through the experiment apply the proposed system to generate a summary for arabic texts with compression ratio of of the document sentences
extract the corresponding english sentences to have the equivalent english summary
generate the english summary of english texts corresponding to arabic ones using extractor system
compare the similarity of the equivalent english summary and english summary
table shows the compression of a sample document merging heuristic summaries
table presents its equivalent english summary
extractor summarization is given in table
the average results of similarity between extractor and the proposed system is nearly for compression summaries
more evaluation is still required to measure the similarity at different compression ratios


table equivalent english summary with shaded area represent similarities with extractor guided by the convention on the rights of the child unicef in strengthened its core humanitarian policy to uphold the rights of children and women in crises
unicef reframed its core commitments for children cccs in emergencies as the core commitments for children in humanitarian action with disaster risk reduction integrated throughout
the core commitments for children also moved from a focus on activities to broader strategic results that link humanitarian action to the fulfillment of children s and women s rights in each of unicef s programme sectors
thus reconceived unicef s humanitarian action offers a potential platform for supporting resilience at the national and community levels

this programme has had a significant impact in the communities results show an increase in national treatment capacity of severe acute malnutrition from cases per month in to cases per month in

conclusions to this in research we have presented an arabic summarization for extracting relevant sentences from free texts
the system exploits statistical and linguistic features important keyphrases
identify through experiments we show that different keyphrase based scoring schemes can direct the proposed sentence extractor towards one or more summarization goals
