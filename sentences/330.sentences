v i x r a abstract in this paper we construct a new japanese speech corpus for speech based summarization and simplication jsss nounced triple s
given the success of reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences we aim to design more difcult tasks for delivering information to humans
our corpus contains voices recorded for two tasks that have a role in ing information under constraints duration constrained to speech summarization and speaking style simplication
it also contains utterances of long form sentences as an optional task
this paper describes how we designed the corpus which is available on our project page
index terms speech corpus japanese speech summarization speaking style simplication text to speech
introduction text to speech tts synthesis achieved to synthesize human quality speech in very limited tasks e

reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences of some rich resourced languages
both open source code and open speech corpora help open innovation of speech based technologies
since we have released high quality and large scale japanese speech corpora
the jsut and jsut song corpora are for voice synthesis and the jvs and jvs music corpora are for multi speaker singer modeling
open projects developed by third ties provide synthesis engines and machine learning recipes ing our corpora
with the success of reading style speech synthesis from short form sentences we aim to design two challenging tasks for delivering information to humans duration constrained text to speech summarization and speaking style tion
the former summarizes text by a spoken language at a sired duration and the latter synthesizes speech intelligible for non native speakers
these tasks help provide information der the constraints of time limitations or language prociency
they are challenging because their speech characteristics are far from those of basic reading style speech
for these tasks we developed a new japanese speech corpus jsss pronounced triple s
our corpus poses speech data and its transcription
we recorded speech with high quality settings studio recording uncompressed dio format and a well experienced native speaker
we also recorded speech of and long form sentences as an tional task
our corpus has eight hours of high quality speech data and is available at our project page
from the next section we describe how we designed the corpus

corpus design our corpus consists of the following four sub corpora
summarization utterances for duration constrained to speech summarization simplication short utterances spoken in slow ble style short form short utterances spoken with read style long form long utterances spoken with read style the directory structures of the corpus are listed below
sub dir name indicates the sub directory described in the following sections

long form sub dir name original transcript




summarization automatic text summarization generates a short coherent summary of given text shortening it while retaining its important content
text length constrained text tion is text summarization technology that has practical plication it abstractively summarizes text to t a device that plays a summary
against such textual length constraints this sub section addresses speech length constraint
namely we propose a new task named speech length constrained or duration constrained text to speech summarization
it tively summarizes text with a spoken language to a desired speech duration
we recorded speech for this task
the text to be rized was web news which we saved in original
txt
our speaker summarized the texts and uttered them to t duration that the speaker chose in advance
the durations chosen for each text were around and sec
we did not set time limits for recording and the speaker could re record as many times as needed
after the recording rst we manually transcribed the speech
then we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks and added sentence level time alignment as shown low
we saved the transcription in transcript

benesse corporation conducted a survey of ried women between the ages of and to nd out what the chinese characters for this year would be and the number one choice was which means funny or change


furthermore positive characters are listed in the chinese characters for next year
first place is bright second place is fun and third place is happy


i feel hopeful that next year will be bright fun and happy


simplication given the effect the global pandemic has had on japan in there is a question of how we can convey emergency and lifeline information to the approximately three million eign residents living in japan
the immigration vices agency of japan and the agency for cultural affairs ported that many foreign residents prefer simple japanese rather than english for information services
simple japanese speech is much different from standard reading style speech
simple japanese sentences use daily use phrases with a ited vocabulary and are uttered in a slow intelligible style
text simplication with lexical constraint can potentially articially simplify vocabulary in text
on the other hand here we deal with speaking style simplication which aims to cially synthesize speech in a slow intelligible style
fore we instructed a speaker on the speaking style and recorded speech of simple pre designed sentences
an example is below
cf
there was a big earthquake
when uttering a long form sentence that consists of tiple sentences human speakers usually insert phrase breaks between word transitions without punctuation
this plays an important role in listenable and expressive speech
thesizing such speech is more challenging than ing basic short utterances
to construct a corpus for it we recorded speech uttering wikipedia articles corresponding to sub dir name
our speaker uttered articles paragraph by paragraph excluding tables gures and their captions
ter the recording we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks and sentence level time alignment as shown below

in kagawa prefecture udon is a particularly popular local dish and the amount consumed per person is also the highest in japan in terms of prefectural statistics


this is one of the most successful ples of a regional brand using the name of a region as a brand for food and other items resulting in an increase in the number of tourists an increase in the amount of udon produced and an increase in name recognition



in this sub corpus we saved the original text in nal
txt and transcription in transcript
txt
note that punctuation in the transcribed text was inserted at the phrase breaks so the positions differ from that of the original text

results of data collection in this sub corpus we saved the text in transcript
txt and manually converted it into in hiragana

short form synthesizing an isolated short utterance is a basic tts task
to build a basic tts system we recorded speech data of form sentence utterances
we prepared three subsets sponding to sub dir name from the jsut corpus as follows
phoneme balanced minimal set mid sized set that includes japanese matopoeias large sized set after the recording we manually added punctuation at the phrase breaks
note that the positions are different from the original data stored in the jsut corpus
syllabary that shows pronunciation we hired a female native japanese speaker who is not a professional speaker but has voice training
we recorded her voice in an anechoic room at the university of tokyo using an ipad mini with a mounted shure a microphone
the rst author directed the recording
her voice was nally sampled at khz and downsampled to khz by sptk
we recorded in bit sample riff wav format and coded in bit sample format
sentences transcriptions were encoded in
for duration constrained text to speech summarization we used the livedoor new corpus as the original text to be summarized
for speaking style tion we followed text and speaking style instructiond provided by hirosaki
for long form utterances we used three featured japanese articles from wikipedia sanuki udon downloaded

statistics table lists the number of utterances and durations for each sub corpus
simplication and short form consist of short utterances approximately seconds per utterance
rization and long form consist of utterances approximately seconds per utterance approximately times longer than short utterances
the total duration is approximately hours which is slightly shorter than our previous corpus designed for the end to end tts

conclusion in this paper we constructed the jsss voice corpus
we signed the corpus for text to speech summarization style simplication and form tts synthesis
