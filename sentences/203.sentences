v i x r a abstract unilateral contracts such as terms of service play a substantial role in modern digital life
however few users read these documents fore accepting the terms within as they are too long and the language too complicated
we propose the task of summarizing such legal documents in plain english which would able users to have a better understanding of the terms they are accepting
we propose an initial dataset of legal text pets paired with summaries written in plain english
we verify the quality of these maries manually and show that they involve heavy abstraction compression and initial experiments show that cation
pervised extractive summarization methods do not perform well on this task due to the level of abstraction and style differences
we conclude with a call for resource and technique opment for simplication and style transfer for legal language
introduction although internet users accept unilateral contracts such as terms of service on a regular basis it is well known that these users rarely read them
nonetheless these are binding contractual ments
a recent study suggests that up to of users do not fully read the terms of service before accepting them obar and oeldorf hirsch
additionally they nd that two of the top three factors users reported for not reading these ments were that they are perceived as too long formation overload and too complicated cult to understand
this can be seen in table where a section of the terms of service for a ular phone app includes a word paragraph that can be distilled down to a word summary
the european union s general data protection original text by using our services you are agreeing to these terms our trainer guidelines and our privacy policy
if you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of the parent you are agreeing to these terms on behalf of yourself and your who are authorized to use the services pursuant to these terms and in our privacy policy

bottom a summary written by a community member of tldrlegal
regulation the united states plain ing act and new york state s plain glish law show that many levels of ment have recognized the need to make legal mation more accessible to non legal communities
additionally due to recent social movements manding accessible and transparent policies on the use of personal data on the internet sykuta et al
multiple online communities have formed that are dedicated to manually annotating various unilateral contracts
we propose the task of the automatic rization of legal documents in plain english for a non legal audience
we hope that such a logical advancement would enable a greater ber of people to enter into everyday contracts with a better understanding of what they are agreeing to
automatic summarization is often used to duce information overload especially in the news domain nenkova et al

summarization has been largely missing in the legal genre with notable exceptions of judicial judgments dar and lapalme hachey and grover

and case reports galgani et al
as well as information extraction on patents tseng et al
tang et al

while some companies have conducted proprietary research in the marization of contracts this information sits hind a large pay wall and is geared toward law professionals rather than the general public
in an attempt to motivate advancement in this area we have collected sets of contract sections and corresponding reference summaries which can be used as a test set for such a task
we have compiled these sets from two websites icated to explaining complicated legal documents in plain english
rather than attempt to summarize an entire ument these sources summarize each document at the section level
in this way the reader can ence the more detailed text if need be
the maries in this dataset are reviewed for quality by the rst author who has years of professional contract drafting experience
the dataset we propose contains sets of allel text
we show the level of abstraction through the number of novel words in the reference maries which is signicantly higher than the stractive single document summaries created for the shared tasks of the document understanding conference duc in over et al
a standard dataset used for single document news summarization
additionally we utilize several common readability metrics to show that there is an average of a year reading level difference tween the original documents and the reference summaries in our legal dataset
in initial experimentation using this dataset we employ popular unsupervised extractive rization models such as textrank mihalcea and tarau and greedy kl haghighi and derwende as well as lead baselines
we show that such methods do not perform well on this dataset when compared to the same methods on duc
these results highlight the fact that this is a very challenging task
as there is not rently a dataset in this domain large enough for pervised methods we suggest the use of methods developed for simplication style transfer
in this paper we begin by discussing how this task relates to the current state of text tion and similar tasks in section
we then dataset is available at
lauramanor duce the novel dataset and provide details on the level of abstraction compression and readability in section
next we provide results and ysis on the performance of extractive tion baselines on our data in section
finally we discuss the potential for unsupervised systems in this genre in section
related work given a document the goal of single document summarization is to produce a shortened summary of the document that captures its main semantic content nenkova et al

existing research extends over several genres including news over et al
see et al
grusky et al
scientic writing tac jaidka et al
yasunaga et al
legal case reports et al

a critical factor in ful summarization research is the availability of a dataset with parallel document human summary pairs for system evaluation
however no such publicly available resource for summarization of contracts exists to date
we present the rst dataset in this genre
note that unlike other genres where human summaries paired with original documents can be found at scale e

the cnn dailymail dataset see et al
resources of this kind are yet to be curated created for contracts
as tional supervised summarization systems require these types of large datasets the resources leased here are intended for evaluation rather than training
additionally as a rst step we restrict our initial experiments to unsupervised baselines which do not require training on large datasets
the dataset we present summarizes contracts in plain english
while there is no precise tion of plain english the general philosophy is to make a text readily accessible for as many english speakers as possible
mellinkoff tiersma
guidelines for plain english often suggest a preference for words with saxon etymologies rather than a latin romance etymologies the use of short words sentences and paragraphs
tiersma kimble
in this respect the proposed task involves some level of text cation as we will discuss in section

however existing resources for text simplication target eracy reading levels xu et al
or ers of english as a second language zhu et al

additionally these models are trained
gov ing wikipedia or news articles which are quite different from legal documents
these systems are trained without access to sentence aligned lel corpora they only require semantically similar texts shen et al
yang et al
li et al

to the best of our knowledge however there is no existing dataset to facilitate the transfer of legal language to plain english
data this section introduces a dataset compiled from two websites dedicated to explaining unilateral contracts in plain english and
these websites clarify language within legal documents by providing summaries for cic sections of the original documents
the data was collected using and a json interface provided by each website s api
summaries are submitted and maintained by members of the site community neither website requires nity members to be law professionals

focuses mostly on software licenses however we only scraped documents related to specic companies rather than generic licenses the scraped i

figure unique n grams in the reference summary contrasting our legal dataset with duc single document summarization data
while the multiple references can be useful for system development and evaluation the qualities of these summaries varied greatly
therefore each text was examined by the rst author who has three years of professional experience in contract drafting for a software company
a total of sets had at least one quality summary in the set
for each the annotator selected the most tive summary to be used in this paper
of the accepted summaries more than thirds of them are templatic summaries
a summary deemed templatic if it could be found in more than one summary set either word word or with just the service name changed
ever of the templatic summaries which were selected as the best of their set there were unique summaries
this indicates that the platic summaries which were selected for the nal dataset are relatively unique
a total of summaries were outright rejected for a variety of reasons including summaries that were a repetition of another summary for the same source snippet were an exact quote of the original text included opinionated language that could not be inferred from the original text or only described the topic of the quote but not the content
we also rejected any maries that are longer than the original texts they summarize

though these metrics were originally formulated based on us grade levels we have adjusted the numbers to provide the equivalent age correlated with the respective us grade level
we ran each measurement on the reference summaries and original texts
as shown in table the reference summaries scored lower than the original texts for each test by an average of years
words we also seek to single out lexical culty as legal text often contains vocabulary that is difcult for non professionals
to do this we obtain the top words ws most associated with summaries and top words wd most associated with the original snippets described below and consider the differences of ari and f k measures
we chose these two measures because they are a weighted sum of a word and sentential properties as sentential information is kept the same word sentences the differences will reect the change in readability of the words most associated with plain english summaries original texts
to collect ws and wd we calculate the log odds ratio for each word a measure used in prior work comparing summary text and original documents nye and nenkova
the log odds ratio compares the probability of a word w occurring in the set of all summaries s vs
original texts d figure ratio of words in the reference summary to words in the original text
the ratio was calculated by dividing the number of words in the reference summary by the number of words in the original text

when compared to a standard abstractive news dataset also shown in the graph duc the legal dataset is signicantly more abstractive
furthermore as shown in figure the dataset is very compressive with a mean compression rate of
std

the original texts have a mean of
std
sentences per document and a mean of

words per document
the erence summaries have a mean of

readability to verify that the summaries more accessible to a wider audience we also compare the readability of the reference summaries and the original texts
full texts we make a comparison between the original contract sections and respective maries using four common readability metrics

we calculate the differences in years of ari and f k scores between ws and wd
f f
hence there is a year reading level distinction between the two sets of words an indication that lexical difculty is paramount in legal text
summarization baselines we present our legal dataset as a test set for tracts summarization
in this section we report baseline performances of unsupervised tive methods as most recent supervised abstractive summarization methods e

rush et al
see et al
would not have enough training data in this domain
we chose to look at the lowing common baselines textrank proposed by mihalcea and tarau textrank harnesses the pagerank algorithm to choose the sentences with the highest similarity scores to the original ment
klsum an algorithm introduced by haghighi and vanderwende which greedily selects the sentences that mize the kullback lieber kl divergence text and proposed between the original summary
a common baseline in news rization is to select the rst sentences of the original text as the summary see et al

with this dataset we include the rst sentence as the summary as it is the closest to the average number of sentences per ence

lead k a variation of this baseline selects the rst k sentences until a word limit is satised
random k this baseline selects a random sentence until a word limit is satised
for this baseline the reported numbers are an erage of runs on the entire dataset
settings we employ lowercasing and zation as well as remove stop words and ation during pre
for textrank sum lead k and random k we produce maries budgeted at the average number of words among all summaries rush et al

ever for the sentence which causes the summary to exceed the budget we keep or discard the full sentence depending on which resulting summary is closer to the budgeted length
results to gain a quantitative understanding of the baseline results we employed rouge lin
rouge is a standard metric used for uating summaries based on the lexical overlap tween a generated summary and gold reference summaries
the rouge scores for the vised summarization baselines found in this paper can be found in table
in the same table we also tabulate rouge scores of the same baselines run on duc over et al
documents with mary lengths of words following the same settings
note that our performance is a bit ent from reported numbers in mihalcea and tarau as we performed different pre processing and the summary lengths were not processed in the same way
was used for lemmatization and identication of this paper we utilized the textrank package from summa nlp
com textrank stop words
tldrlegal combined duc r l r l r l r l
textrank
klsum

lead k random k























































table performance for each dataset on the baselines was measured using and rouge l
crucially rouge scores are much higher on duc than on our legal dataset
we speculate that this is due to the highly abstractive nature of this data in addition to the divergent styles of the summaries and original texts
in general lead k performed best on both and duc
the performance gap between textrank and lead k is much larger on duc than on our dataset
on the legal datasets textrank outperformed lead k on drlegal and is very close to the performance of lead k on
additionally random k performed only about rouge points lower than lead k on our dataset while it scored almost points lower on the duc dataset
we tribute this to the structure of the original text news articles i
e
duc follow the inverse pyramid structure where the rst few sentences give an overview of the story and the rest of the ticle content is diverse
in contracts the sentences in each section are more similar to each other ically
qualitative analysis we examined some of the results of the unsupervised extractive techniques to get a better understanding of what methods might improve the results
select examples can be found in table
as shown by example the extractive tems performed well when the reference maries were either an extract or a compressed sion of the original text
however examples show various ways the extractive systems were not able to perform well
in the extractive systems were able to select an appropriate sentence but the sentence is much more complex than the reference summary
lizing text simplication techniques may help in these circumstances
in we see that the reference summary is much better able to abstract over a larger portion of the original text than the selected sentences
shows that by having much shorter sentences the reference summary is able to cover more of the original text
is able to restate word inal text in words
finally in the sentences from the original text are extremely long and thus the automated summaries while only having one sentence are and words respectively
here we also see that the reference summaries have a much ent style than the original text
discussion our preliminary experiments and analysis show that summarizing legal contracts in plain english is challenging and point to the potential ness of a simplication or style transfer system in the summarization pipeline
yet this is lenging
first there may be a substantial domain gap between legal documents and texts that isting simplication systems are trained on e

wikipedia news
second popular supervised proaches such as treating sentence simplication as monolingual machine translation specia zhu et al
woodsend and lapata xu et al
zhang and lapata would be difcult to apply due to the lack of aligned parallel corpora
possible directions clude unsupervised lexical simplication utilizing distributed representations of words glavas and stajner paetzold and specia pervised sentence simplication using rich tic structure narayan and gardent or supervised style transfer techniques shen et al
yang et al
li et al

however there is not currently a dataset in this domain large enough for unsupervised methods nor corpora aligned but comparable in semantics across legal and plain english which we see as a call for ture research

conclusion in this paper we propose the task of summarizing legal documents in plain english and present an initial evaluation dataset for this task
we gather our dataset from online sources dedicated to plaining sections of contracts in plain english and manually verify the quality of the summaries
we show that our dataset is highly abstractive and that the summaries are much simpler to read
this task is challenging as popular unsupervised extractive summarization methods do not perform well on this dataset and as discussed in section rent methods that address the change in register are mostly supervised as well
