org abstract we describe a new method for summarizing ities and dierences in a pair of related documents using a graph representation for text
concepts noted by words phrases and proper names in the document are represented positionally as nodes in the graph along with edges corresponding to semantic lations between items
given a perspective in terms of which the pair of documents is to be summarized the algorithm rst uses a spreading activation technique to discover in each document nodes semantically related to the topic
the activated graphs of each document are then matched to yield a graph corresponding to similarities and dierences between the pair which is rendered in natural language
an evaluation of these techniques has been carried out
with the mushrooming of the quantity of on line text information triggered in part by the growth of the world wide web it is especially useful to have tools which can help users digest information content
text summarization attempts to address this problem by taking a partially structured source text extracting information content from it and presenting the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs
in exploiting summarization many modern information retrieval applications need marization systems which scale up to large volumes of unrestricted text
in such applications a common problem which arises is the existence of multiple uments covering similar information as in the case of multiple news stories about an event or a sequence of events
a particular challenge for text summarization is to be able to summarize the similarities and ences in information content among these documents in a way that is sensitive to the needs of the user
in order to address this challenge a suitable sentation for content must be developed
most able text summarization systems which aim at bility e

echosearch rau kupiec et al

provide a capability to extract tences or other units that match the relevance criteria used by the system
however they do nt attempt to understand the concepts in the text and their ships in short they do nt represent the meaning of the text
in the ideal case the meaning of each text would be made up say of the meanings of sentences in the text which in turn would be made up of the ings of words
while the ideal case is currently sible beyond a small fragment of a natural language it is possible to arrive at approximate representations of meaning
in this paper we propose an approach to scalable text summarization which builds an abstract content representation based on explicitly ing entities and the relations between entities of the sort that can be robustly extracted by current mation extraction systems
here concepts described in a document denoted by text items such as words phrases and proper names are represented ally as nodes in a graph along with edges ing to semantic and topological relations between cepts
the relations between concepts are whatever relations can be feasibly extracted in the context of the scalability requirements of an application these include specialization relationships e

which can be extracted based on a thesaurus as well as association relationships such as relationships between people and organizations or coreference relationships between tities
salient regions of the graph can then be input to further synthesis processing to eventually yield natural language summaries which can in general go well beyond extracts to abstracts or
it is also important to note that in computing a salience function for text items most eldable text summarization systems do not typically deal with the context sensitive nature of the summarization task
a user may have an interest in a particular topic which may make particular text units more salient
to vide a degree of context sensitivity the summarization algorithm described here takes a parameter specifying the topic or perspective with respect to which the american association for articial the implementation at the time of writing is intelligence www

conned to extracts
summary should be generated
this topic represents a set of entry points nodes into the graph
to termine which items are salient the graph is searched for nodes semantically related to the topic using a spreading activation technique
this approach diers from other network approaches such as the use of ral nets

the hopeld net approach discussed in chen et al
in two ways rst the structure of our graph reects both semantic relations derived from text as well as linear order in the text the latter via the positional encoding the linear order is especially important for natural language
second as will be claried below the set of nodes which become highly activated is a function of link type and distance from entry nodes unlike other approaches which use a xed bound on the number of nodes or convergence to a stable state
of course if we are able to discover given a topic and a pair of related documents nodes in each ument semantically related to the topic then these nodes and their relationships can be compared to tablish similarities and dierences between the ment pair
given a pair of related news stories about an event or a sequence of events the problem of nding similarities and dierences becomes one of comparing graphs which have been activated by a common topic
in practice candidate common topics can be selected from the intersection of the activated concepts in each graph i
e
which will be denoted by words phrases or names
this allows dierent summaries to be ated based on the choice of common topic
algorithm fsd graphs find similarities and dierences takes a pair of such activated graphs and compares them to yield similarities and dierences
the results are then subject to synthesis processing to yield document summaries
these graph construction and manipulation niques are highly scalable in that they yield useful summaries in a reasonable time when applied to large quantities of unrestricted text of the kind found on the world wide web
in what follows we rst scribe the graph representation and the tools used to build it followed by a description of the graph search and graph matching algorithms
we also provide an evaluation which assesses the usefulness of a variety of dierent graph based multi document summarization algorithms
representing meaningful text content a text is represented as a graph
as shown in ure each node represents an underlying concept responding to a word occurrence and has a distinct input position
associated with each such node is a feature vector characterizing the various features of the word in that position
as shown in part of the gure a node can have adjacency links adj to textually jacent nodes same links to other occurrences of the same concept and other links corresponding to adj alpha same phrase adj adj

name adj adj coref adj adj name
figure graph representation tic relationships represented by alpha to be discussed below
phrase links tie together sequences of jacent nodes which belong to a phrase part
in part we show a name link as well as the coref link between subgraphs relating positions of name currences which are coreferential
name links can be specialized to dierent types e

person province
the concepts denoted by phrases and names cated by ellipses around subgraphs in figure are tinguished from the concepts denoted by words which make up the phrases and names
tools for building document graphs our experiments make use of a sentence and graph tagger which contains a very extensive expression based sentence boundary disambiguator aberdeen et al

the boundary tion module is part of a comprehensive preprocess pipeline which utilizes a list of abbreviations and a series of hand crafted rules to identify sentence aries
then the alembic part of speech tagger erdeen et al
is invoked on the text
this ger uses the rule sequence learning approach of brill
names and relationships between names are then extracted from the document using sra s towl krupka a system
then salient words and phrases are extracted from the text using the tf
idf metric which makes use of a reference corpus derived from the trec harman
the weight dwik of term in document i is given by dwik tfik trained on about words of wall street journal text the tagger obtained accuracy on a arate test set of words of wsj aberdeen et al

phrases are useful in summarization as they often ten denote signicant concepts and thus can be good indicators and descriptors of salient regions of text
our phrase extraction method nds candidate phrases using several patterns dened over part of speech tags
one pattern for example uses the maximal sequence of one or more adjectives followed by one or more nouns
once stop words are ltered out the weight of a candidate phrase is the average of the tf
idf weights of remaining i
e
content words in the phrase plus a factor which adds a small bonus in proportion to the length of the phrase to extract more specic phrases
we use a contextual parameter to avoid redundancy among phrases by selecting each term in a phrase at most once
the weight of a phrase w of length n tent words in document i is i p n dwik n where is if the word has been seen before and otherwise
we now discuss the alpha links
association lations between concepts are based on what is vided by netowl for example bill gates president of microsoft will give rise to the link president between the person and the organization
in lieu of ization links between concepts we initially took the simple approach of pre computing the semantic tance links between pairs of words using wordnet
miller based on the relative height of the most specic common ancestor class of the two words ject to a context dependent class weighting parameter
for example for the texts in figure the words idence and house are very close because a sense of residence in wordnet has house as an immediate pernym
this technique is known to be oversensitive to the structure of the thesaurus
to improve matters the corpus sensitive approach of resnick see also smeaton and quigley using the reference corpus has also been implemented however the full exploitation of this along with suitable tion techniques will have to await further research
graph search by spreading activation the goal of the spreading activation algorithm derived from the method of chen et al
is to nd all those nodes that are semantically linked to the given activated nodes
the search for semantically related text is performed by spreading from topic words to other document nodes via a variety of link types as scribed previously
document nodes whose strings are equivalent to topic terms using a stemming procedure stem are treated as entry points into the graph
the weight of neighboring nodes is dependent on the type of node link travelled
for adjacent links node weight is an exponentially decaying function of activating node weight and the distance between nodes
distances are scaled so that travelling across sentence boundaries is more expensive than travelling within a sentence but less than travelling across paragraph boundaries
for the other link types the neighboring weight is lated as a function of link weight and activating node weight
the method iteratively nds neighbors to the given starting nodes using stem in matching strings associated with nodes pushes the activating nodes on the output stack and the new nodes on the active stack and repeats until a system dened threshold on the number of output nodes is met or all nodes have been reached
as an example we show the the average weights of nodes at dierent sentence positions in the raw graph in figure
the results after spreading given the topic tupac amaru are shown in figure
the spreading has changed the activation weight surface so that some new related peaks have emerged e

sentence and old peaks have been reduced e

sentence which had a high tf
idf score but was not related to tupac amaru
the exponential decay function is also dent in the neighborhoods of the peaks
unlike much previous use of spreading activation methods for query expansion as a part of tion retrieval salton and buckley chen et al
our use of spreading activation is to reweight the words in the document rather than to decide for each word whether it should be included or not
the later synthesis module determines the ultimate selection of nodes based on node weight as well as its relationship to other nodes
as a result we partially insulate the summary from the potential sensitivity of the ing to the choice of starting nodes and search extent
for example we would get the same results for tupac amaru as the topic as with mrta
further this means the spreader need not capture all nodes that are vant to a summary directly but only to suggest new regions of the input text that may not immediately appear to be related
this has distinct advantages compared to certain information retrieval methods which simply nd gions of the text similar to the query
for example the reuters sentence plotted in figure and shown in figure might have been found via an information retrieval method which matched on the query tupac amaru allowing for mrta as an abbreviated alias for the name
however it would have not found other formation related to the tupac amaru in the reuters article the spreading method follows a link from tupac amaru to release in sentence via adj to other stances of release via the same link eventually ing sentence where release is adj to the name tor polay the group s leader
likewise the algorithm spreads to sentences and in that article which mention mrta but not tupac amaru
in the ap cle a thesaurus link becomes more useful in ing a similar connection it is able to nd a direct link from tupac amaru to leaders via adj in sentence and from there to its synonym chief in sentence via alpha which is adj to victor
summarizing multiple documents by graph matching the goal of fsd graphs is to nd the concepts which best describe the similarities and dierences in the given regions of text
it does this by rst ing which concepts nodes are common and which are dierent
the computation of common nodes given graphs and is given by common
ferences are computed by dif f erences common
concept g holds if there is a in g such that either or
the user may provide a threshold on the minimal number of uniquely ered concepts or on the minimal coverage weight
currently the synthesis module simply outputs the set of sentences covering the shared terms and the set of sentences covering the unique terms hilighting the shared and unique terms in each and indicating which document the sentence came from
this is something course the relation could also be found if the system could correctly interpret the expressions its chief in the ap article and their leader in the reuters article

in the next phase of search we expect to better exploit the concepts in the text their semantic relations and concepts from the thesaurus to link extracts into abstracts
sentence selection is based on the coverage of nodes in the common and dierent lists
sentences are ily selected based on the average activated weight of the covered words for a sentence its score in terms of coverage of common nodes is given by where s
the score for dierences is lar
the user may specify the maximal number of tences in a particular category common or dierent to control which sentences are output
as an example consider the application of graphs to the activated graph in figure the reuters article and an activated graph in figure an ap article of the same date describing the same hostage crisis
the activated graphs had words in mon out of words for the former graph and for the latter
the algorithm extracts ties with the commonalities with the strongest ations being on top
the high scoring commonalities and dierences are the ones shown in figure
the gorithm discovers that both articles talk about victor polay e

the reuters sentence mentioned earlier and the ap sentence fujimori japanese sador residence and cabinet
notice that the system is able to extract commonalities without tupac amaru being directly present
regarding dierences the rithm discovers that the ap article is the only one to explain how the rebels posed as waiters sentence and the reuters article is the only one which told how the rebels once had public sympathy sentence
evaluation eectiveness of spreading activation graph search methods for evaluating text summarization approaches can broadly classied into two categories
the rst is an extrinsic evaluation in which the quality of the mary is judged based on how it eects the completion metric accuracy precision recall time mins usefulness of text in deciding relevance to usefulness of text in deciding irrelevance to preference for more or less text full text




too much text
summary




just right
table summaries versus full text task accuracy time and user feedback condition without spreading with spreading without subgraph extraction



table mean ratings of multi document summaries commonalities dierences of some other task
the second approach an sic evaluation judges the quality of the summarization directly based on user judgements of informativeness coverage
in our evaluation we performed both type of experiments
in our extrinsic evaluation we evaluated the ness of graph search spreading in the context of an information retrieval task
in this experiment jects were informed only that they were involved in a timed information retrieval research experiment
in each run a subject was presented with a pair of query and document and asked to determine whether the document was relevant or irrelevant to the query
in one experimental condition the document shown was the full text in the other the document shown was a summary generated with the top sentences
subjects four altogether were rotated across experimental ditions but no subject was in both conditions for the same query document pair
we hypothesized that if the summarization was useful it would result in ings in time without signicant loss in accuracy
four queries were preselected from the trec man collection of topics with the idea of ploiting their associated binary relevance judgments
these were where are the nuclear power plants in the u
s
and what has been their rate of tion what are the prospects of the bec separatists achieving independence from the rest of canada how widespread is the illegal posal of medical waste in the u
s
and what is being done to combat this dumping and why is the infant mortality rate in the united states higher than it is in most other industrialized
a subset of the trec collection of documents was indexed using the smart retrieval system from nell buckley
using smart the top hits from each query was reserved for the experiment
overall each subject was presented with four batches of query document pairs i
e
documents were a trec query and a document to be rized the entry nodes for spreading activation are those document nodes which are to non stop word terms found in the trec query
presented to each subject with a questionnaire after each batch
accuracy metrics in information retrieval include precision percentage of retrieved documents that are relevant i
e
number retrieved which were relevant total number retrieved and recall age of relevant documents that are retrieved i
e
ber retrieved which were relevant total number known to be relevant
in table we show the average precision and erage recall over all queries relevance decisions altogether
the table shows that when the summaries were used the performance was faster than with text
p
using analysis of variance f test without signicant loss of accuracy
while we would expect shorter texts to take less time to read it is striking that these short extracts on average one seventh of the length of the corresponding full text which in turn was on average about words long are eective enough to support accurate retrieval
in addition the subjects feedback from the questionnaire shown in the last three rows of the table indicate that the spreading based summaries were found to be ful
eectiveness of fsd graphs we also performed an intrinsic evaluation of our marization approach by generating summaries from fsd graphs with and without spreading activation
in this evaluation we used user judgements to assess rectly the quality of fsd graphs using spreading to nd commonalities and dierences between pairs of documents
when fsd graphs is applied to raw graphs which are not reweighted by spreading the proach does not exploit at all the relational model of summarization
we hypothesized that the spreading or extract subgraphs methods would result in more tinent summaries than with the raw graphs
for this experiment pairs of articles on international events were selected from searches on the world wide web including articles from reuters associated press the washington post and the new york times

figure texts of two related articles
the top salient sentences containing common words have these common words in bold face likewise the top salient sentences containing unique words have these unique words in italics
pairs were selected such that each member of a pair was closely related to the other but by no means tical the pairs were drawn from dierent geopolitical regions so that no pair was similar to another
the articles we found by this method happened to be short ones on average less than two hundred words long
a distinct topic was selected for each pair based on the common activators method
summaries were then generated both with no spreading using only the raw tf
idf weights of the words and with spreading
three subjects were selected and each subject was presented with a series of web forms
in each form the subject was shown a pair of articles along with a summary of their similarities and a summary of their dierences with respect to the pair topic
each subject was asked to judge on a scale of bad to good how well the summaries pinpointed the similarities and dierences with respect to the topic
each subject was rotated at random through all the forms and experimental tions so that each subject saw dierent forms and made decisions data points altogether
as shown in table using spreading results in proved summaries over not using spreading for both commonalities and dierences
it is interesting to note that the biggest improvement comes from the ences found using spreading
this reects the fact that the spreading algorithm uses the topic to constrain and order the dierences found
by contrast in a tf
idf weighting scheme words which are globally unique are rewarded highest regardless of their link to the topic at hand
conclusion we have described a new method for multi document summarization based on a graph representation for text
the summarization exploits the results of cent progress in information extraction to represent salient units of text and their relationships
by ing relations between units and the perspective from which the comparison is desired the summarizer can pinpoint similarities and dierences
our approach is highly domain independent even though we have trated its power mainly for news articles
currently the synthesis component is rudimentary relying on sentence extraction to exemplify similarities and ences
in future work we expect to more fully exploit alpha links especially by more systematic extraction of semantic distance measures along with corpus based statistics from wordnet
we also plan to exploit both text and thesaurus concepts to link extracts into stracts
