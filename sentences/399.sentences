this paper summarizes highlights of the

and
sessions of the xxvith international cosmic ray conference in salt lake city which were devoted to issues of origin composition acceleration and propagation
introduction a review of a collection of papers on cosmic ray origin acceleration and agation is necessarily broad
historically international cosmic ray conferences have separated the papers in these extensive subjects for consideration by ent rapporteurs
however since the rome conference in a new precedent has been established with a review of all these elds becoming the responsibility of one individual
this has perhaps been propelled by the burgeoning number of astrophysics related contributions to the meetings and has reduced the hensiveness possible in a rapporteur s written summary
this tract represents my attempt to assemble a description of interesting and new results presented at the salt lake city conference pertaining to the origin acceleration and propagation themes
space limitations preclude completeness and accordingly i ask for ance from authors who feel their work is not given a sucient exposure here
i also oer the standard disclaimer that the views expressed here are personal and may the contributing authors not reect the perspective of the management i

origin and composition the power supply for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays is traditionally attributed to supernova remnants yet there is much debate as to the mass and type of the progenitor stars the specic nature of the circumstellar environment and the galactic origin of the material accelerated
this discussion has spawned a eld rich with ideas with diagnostics largely provided by cosmic ray primary compositional data
the papers presented at this meeting generally relate to one of two problems i the discussion of whether fresh supernova ejecta or environmental dust grains provide the seeds for cosmic ray acceleration and explanations of the li be and b abundances the well known libeb problem
early ideas on cosmic rays focused on the environment for their acceleration assuming some pre existing seed population rather than addressing the question of the origin of such seed material
over a period of time it became clear that the galactic cosmic ray photosphere abundance ratios provided valuable clues to the origin of galactic cosmic ray matter
such ratios exhibit e

see berberg tsao barghouty og

a general enrichment of refractory elements i
e those with high condensation temperatures mg al si fe and ni relative to highly volatile ones principally h he n ne and ar
two competing tions of this property emerged
the rst is that low energy ions are pre accelerated in stellar coronae to enrich the interstellar medium ism before participating in acceleration at proximate snr shells
in early work suggested that ment correlates with elemental rst ionization potential fip see also silberberg et al
og

with high fip elements being somewhat suppressed
the fip interpretation was largely driven by the discovery that fip biases the composition of solar energetic particles hence the connection to stellar coronae was made
the second proposal originated with bibring cesarsky and epstein where erosion products of grains formed from old material seed the acceleration process so that enrichment should correlate with volatility
the acceleration process is then naturally enhanced in non linear snr shocks with increasing mass to charge a q ratio of the species in a manner commensurate with observed abundances
while fip proponents are invoking atomic physics concepts and a volatility terpretation appeals to molecular physics the two views are not entirely opposite fip and volatility are clearly related quantities albeit in a rather subtle manner
for many light and heavier sub fe elements these two scenarios provide ble gcr solar abundance ratios
yet success of the fip based models is contingent upon a number of disconnected and controversial assumptions pertaining mostly to h he and and the contribution of wolf rayet winds
in contrast the ity description oers a more coherent picture with fewer debatable assumptions depending principally on the chemistry and composition of interstellar grains
it is therefore becoming the more widely accepted description with the work of felter ramaty og

coming out in support of volatility as the descriptor of cosmic ray abundances
nevertheless their research group had previously vocated fresh supernova ejecta as the seeds for acceleration as opposed to the grains created from older matter in the model of meyer drury ellison
this was a major point of controversy that was addressed and resolved at the conference based on two discriminating pieces of information
the rst diagnostic concerned the c and o ratios
these elements provide ical diagnostics since they possess intermediate fips and are moderately volatile and hence are bridge elements between the volatiles and the refractories
both are key products of nucleosynthesis in massive o and b stars which are the genitors of the type ib and ii supernova that dominate the observed supernova population
the property crucial to the success of the grain acceleration tion is that these two species are present in grains e

various oxides and graphite in just the appropriate amounts to explain their abundances
consequently it becomes apparent that interstellar grain chemistry is the important parameter for the composition problem and should be a focus of future research eorts
the second decisive indicator concerned the age of the seeds for acceleration
since grains can be much older than the snrs that tap them the grain induced cosmic ray composition picture is less subject to temporal restrictions vided by unstable nuclei that oer markers of the chronology of nucleosynthesis
foremost among these is the electron k capture decay of to with a half life of around years for which the ace experiment has recently provided discriminating information the low abundance of relative to fe and the high abundance of weidenbeck et al
og

implies a passing of at least years between nucleosynthesis and acceleration
meyer drury ellison have consistently argued that grains are easily old enough to satisfy the ace temporal constraints
while lingenfelter et al
had advocated a fresh ejecta scenario don lingenfelter ramaty s contribution og

indicated an evolution in their position so that the two groups concurred that the ace dataset does indeed provide age lower bounds that render fresh i
e
young ejecta unlikely seeds for the acceleration process at snr shocks
focus has now turned to timescales of ejecta mixing well in excess of years which can be suitably probed waddington og

by abundance measurements of actinides such as th np cm and pu
westphal og

discussed the potential for the ecco experiment aboard the international space station to provide such discriminating data
the mixing question is pertinent to the discussion of whether superbubbles with many snib snii explosions as opposed to more isolated ism regions with snia progenitors are the locales for cosmic ray origin
the site issue still unresolved provides a natural progression to the libeb problem
this longstanding conundrum relates to the abundances of li be and b in old halo stars the principal spallation products of reactions of nucleosynthetic or ambient and in collisions with hydrogen and helium of either ism or ejecta origin see e

korejwo et al
og

for accelerator data on fragmentation spallation cross sections for various products in the gev nucleon range
balmer like line be ii observations indicate a linear correlation e

ramaty lingenfelter kozlovsky og

fields olive og

of the abundance of libeb with fe metallicity fe h in these metal poor stars note that fe h is eectively an age parameter for these systems
yet theoretically see the review in libeb is expected to increase quadratically with fe h since for a constant supernova rate libeb h should scale as the integral over time of the supernova rate times the total number of antecedent supernovae in the galaxy
this apparent conict becomes cleaner observationally by considering be alone since it provides no ambiguities some of the is probably a product of primordial nucleosynthesis and much of the population may result from neutrino induced spallation on in supernovae
presentations on explaining be h evolution at the conference included papers by ramaty lingenfelter kozlovsky og

and parizot drury og

og


a result common to these two groups is that by separating the light and metallic spallation participants in space a decoupling between the metallicity of stars and their age is eected
this is achieved if there is no signicant mixing between metal poor ism that is accelerated at a supernova remnant s forward shock and the enriched high metallicity ejecta accelerated at a remnant reverse shock parizot drury og


the dominant contributions to be production are then spawned by i low metallicity ism ions accelerated by forward shocks colliding with metal rich supernova ejecta and enriched ejecta material accelerated at reverse shocks interacting with light elements from the surrounding ism
in each case the be production is independent of the ism metallicity generating a be h halo star abundance proportional to fe h metallicity
for this reason ramaty lingenfelter kozlovsky og

argue that the be h evolution with fe h is a strong indication that fresh ejecta are crucial to cosmic ray origin
reconciling the be production with the ace observations of should be a major objective of future studies
supernova cosmic ray energetics also play a constraining role in this discussion with both ramaty et al
and parizot drury observing that there is an underproduction of be by over an order of magnitude in the early galaxy if most supernovae explode in the average ism
this has motivated papers by higdon ramaty lingenfelter og

and parizot drury og

that describe how a superbubble starburst locale for libeb generation can provide prepared metallicity enhanced environs due to the ob stellar associations
the production rate can increase more than tenfold to match the observed abundances in this scenario because the spallation reactions involving enriched ambient cno can tap the greater accelerating potential of forward shocks in snrs
a cautionary note for the libeb problem was sounded by fields and olive og


while historically fe h has been used as the marker of metallicity for discussing be production fields and olive argued that the o h ratio is a far more appropriate indicator since oxygen is an actual participant in the spallation tions that spawn be
the consequences of such a shift in perspective are substantial
the evolution of o h does not trace fe h linearly so that o and fe are dierent indicators of metallicity
accordingly fields and olive observe that be h is more strongly dependent on o h than fe h in halo population ii star atmospheres more closely resembling the quadratic dependence that was anticipated in incipient theoretical considerations of the libeb abundances
the implication of their work is that the so called libeb problem is a tempest in a teapot
this is not entirely discouraging for theorists in their quest for nailing the origin of cosmic rays since the data spread in the be h versus o h diagram is considerable observationally it is more problematic to determine oxygen metallicity than fe h
future rened observations from uniform consistent stellar atmospheres should resolve this issue
propagation studies of propagation have perhaps had the slowest evolution of the covered here
this is essentially imposed by the pace at which new and ing experimental data relating to this complex problem are forthcoming
properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy remain enigmatic presently prohibiting the elimination of any one of the handful of preferred propagation models
foremost in this group is the canonical leaky box approximation the tool of choice for most members of the propagation community due to its simplicity
more cated and physically realistic models with various mutations are the halo diusion picture wind scenarios turbulent diusion model and calculations invoking acceleration each with their proponents see for a review
there are a number of standard tests for the viability of each of these we shall explore here the latest results separately for the cases of propagation of ions and electrons
ions a signicant number of papers were presented many producing very similar results
the leaky box model lbm where a one zone scenario is envisaged with an escape length or rather grammage xlb forming the principal model parameter and the halo diusion picture hdm where the galactic disk and halo represent two regions distinct in their source and diusion properties were the most common invocations e

og


















while these two models dominate the discussion here propagation in galactic winds og









and contributions from re acceleration og







were also considered
in the lbm the grammage parameter is often specied as a broken power law in rigidity r e

ptuskin et al
og

increasing as a moderate power of
particle velocity at non relativistic speeds and declining roughly as xlb for relativistic energies e
this form is chosen i to explain the observed ening of the primary cosmic ray spectrum from the approximately
spectrum expected at sources ii match the observed secondary primary ratios of stable species and to accommodate spectral shapes observed in the transition region between the modulated and unmodulated ion spectrum
coecients of these portionalities are of the order of a few g to match densities of the interstellar medium and establish scale heights above the galactic plane of the order of a kpc or so
physically the decline in xlb as a function of rigidity corresponds to the pectation of greater losses for more energetic particles
the cosmic ray production in the lbm is homogeneous in space not being coupled to the galactic plane
the halo diusion model e

introduces more complexity distinguishing between galactic disk and halo with dierent source densities and propagation characteristics in each region
spatial uniformity can be assumed in each region e

ptuskin et al
og

og

or disk and halo can possess inhomogeneous distributions in altitude z above the plane e

strong moskalenko og


in accord the diusive escape parameter is usually set to xe with the dependence of the diusion coecient for kolmogorov turbulence
essentially free escape arises at the halo extremities in this scenario and the selective connement of matter near the plane renders the pathlength distribution for losses exponential as in the leaky box model
the vertical height of the disk is constrained by the diusive lengthscale for interesting radioactive isotopes years discussed below
a distinct advantage of ballistic lifetime i
e
of the hdm is that it can accommodate the observed low cosmic ray anisotropies that are almost constant out to ev e

see also hillas og

more easily than the lbm due to its weaker dependence of loss scale on rigidity
d d d primary source spectra for species such as carbon and iron alone are insucient to discriminate between leaky box and halo diusion models e

see ptuskin et al
og

being more dependent on solar modulation properties such as the assumed potential

webber og

strong moskalenko og


stable secondary to primary ratios are somewhat more sensitive to model characteristics since they probe energy loss rates in matter traversal i
e
xlb and xe for dierent species involved in nuclear interactions with the interstellar medium
the most popular choices for these ratios corresponding to spallation reactions involving the principal components of cosmic rays are those of boron to carbon b c and sub iron group to iron nuclei
the spectrum of the spallation products traces that of the parent nuclei when they are created with a subsequent steepening being induced by the energy dependent propagation eects
nevertheless the increased data spread appearing in such ratios is sucient to preclude unequivocal discrimination between models so that the lbm and hdm are equally viable e

og

based on analysis of stable secondaries
hence considerable eort was expended in a number of papers that focused on radioactive isotopes
the abundances of suitable secondary radioactive nuclei vide clues to the connement time of cosmic rays in the galaxy e

streitmatter stephens og

and therefore oer observational diagnostics tary to those engendered by matter traversal
suitability is naturally governed by signicant elemental abundances and lifetimes that approximate typical galactic disk diusion timescales of myr
therefore excellent choices include beta decay
myr inverse beta k capture
myr and beta cay
myr is also a possible option though its decay lifetime is still not precisely determined
while often quoted al mg and cl ar fractions represent parent daughter nuclei pairs the ratio of choice for decay is senting the relative abundance of surviving to its sister spallation product rather than its decay ospring
this alternative is aorded by the measured cross sections for spallation reactions in accelerators
note that is optimal for experimental purposes due to the lower mass resolution required to distinguish it from other isotopes
of particular interest is the trans relativistic regime of gev nucleon where time dilation eects are sampled
since the mean proximity of sources from the solar system diers for the leaky box and halo diusion models the fractional abundances of radioactive nuclides expected for the two scenarios are generally disparate
various data model isons were presented by ptuskin soutoul streitmatter og

streitmatter stephens og

and simon molnar og

sometimes expressed as relative abundances the experimentalists preference and sometimes as ing fractions perhaps the theorist s choice which incorporate model dependent information
variations in theoretical predictions were modest and preference for either the lbm or hdm is indiscernible given that model parameters can be priately ne tuned the abundance ratio data from voyager ulysses and missions are typically accurate to only a factor of two
yet the potential for vances in this eld in the near future is signicant
the recent ace data from the cris experiment e

yanasek et al
og

and weidenbeck s highlight talk these proceedings reduced experimental uncertainties in these ratios in the

gev nucleon range down to the level
further gains are anticipated with isomax hams et al
og

which will extend the range of exploration up to a few gev so as to more completely probe the mildly relativistic regime
the possible inuence of galactic winds and interstellar cosmic ray re acceleration complicate the propagation problem
winds away from the galactic disk ically at km sec necessarily enhance loss rates and therefore can impose less stringent requirements on the energy dependence of the diusion and lead to anisotropies in the diusion tensor breitschwerdt dogiel volk og

these authors argue that such winds may explain the small ratio of radial gradients of diuse gamma rays to cosmic rays
ptuskin et al
og

indicate that wind and minimal re acceleration models are both just as consistent with stable secondary primary ratio data as the lbm and hdm
re acceleration models did not achieve the same exposure and topicality as in previous cosmic ray ences
their basic properties are understood
depletions of low energy cosmic rays due to in transit acceleration eectively eliminate the need for a broken power law for the variation of the escape length xlb with rigidity
re acceleration alleviates the problem of weakly rigidity dependent low level anisotropies by permitting a reduced dependence of the escape length on r
at the same time re acceleration has a profound inuence on ions below gev nucleon jones et al
og

that have long residence times this becomes an asset when trying to t b c and sub spectral attenings in the low energy modulation range
in concluding the discussion of ion propagation note that two formalism papers were contributed by forman og

and ragot og

which focused on quasi linear theory aspects of particle diusion in eld turbulence gyro resonant and non resonant respectively works that while interesting for propagation cialists are more salient to heliospheric issues in the sh sessions
electrons considerations of electron propagation were largely conned to the work of one research group webber and his collaborators
nothing extremely new was coming yet discussion of electrons provides an interesting forum for the interplay between cosmic ray physics and astrophysics
the observed cosmic ray total tron spectrum is steeper in the gev range than its ion counterpart suggesting either that ions and electrons possess distinct propagation tics or that electron source spectra are steeper than ion ones
this latter native was promoted in several papers stephens og

higbie et al
og

rockstroh et al
og

and peterson et al
og


inferences in this direction are facilitated by broadening the dynamic range of cosmic ray energies sampled using data of astronomical origin
the diuse radio synchrotron spectrum is very informative since it evades modulation eects and can therefore probe lower electron energies principally in the
gev range
however the model independence of such information is marred at low energies by signicant free free absorption in the ism peterson et al
og


matching tions of the radio derived e spectrum with the cosmic ray electron one measured at higher energies requires assuming a mean interstellar eld of around
while the aforementioned papers advocated an
electron source spectrum the data spread is sucient to render an
spectrum not implausible for the particular diusion model invoked by rockstroh et al and peterson
al
since deductions pertaining to the cosmic ray origin are contingent upon propagation and tion assumptions the atter source spectra are not presently excluded
higbie et al
og

argued that modelling the diuse gamma ray sion with the same monte carlo propagation simulation again points towards a steeper e source distribution simultaneous tting of the pion decay bump in the mev egret data and the relatively steep comptel mev trum with a bremsstrahlung component both experiments were on board the compton gamma ray observatory provides the basis for this assertion
porter protheroe og

arrive at a dierent conclusion when modelling diuse gamma ray emission arguing in favour of atter electron source spectra
these disparate inferences largely reect dierences in propagation models and therefore indicate the limits that should be placed on such assertions at this stage
stephens og

addressed positron propagation and claimed a small sign dependence of modulation while potentially interesting data uncertainties limit this interpretation to merely a prediction for future experimental verication
acceleration theory and astrophysics the subject area of the theory of particle acceleration and astrophysical cations was the most diverse in terms of the material presented at the conference
hence only principal focal points can be addressed in this brief exposition
acceleration theory the discussions of cosmic ray propagation hinge on the widely used assumption that the sources of cosmic rays produce quasi power law populations e with


this is readily satised by test particle acceleration at the strong shocks formed at supernova remnant shells as the expansion ploughs through the ism
this feature has lead to the almost universal acclaim that snrs are the ev
yet there site of cosmic ray acceleration at least up to the knee at are many subtleties including those related to deviations from the test particle approximation how shock heating of the downstream gas is inuenced by the uid dynamics questions of the eciency of injection particularly for electrons and what are the dierences between relativistic and non relativistic shocks
the issue of validity of the test particle approximation is important for the cosmic ray problem
the beauty of diusive acceleration was underscored by the natural explanation it provided for the power law slope of the cosmic ray distribution over many decades in energy
yet this attractive feature is contingent upon two criteria i that the accelerated particles do not modify the dynamics of the shocked ow i
e
act only as test particles to the problem and that there is no particular energy scale for losses of particles
it is palpable that neither of these properties is satised in shocks in snr shells thereby eliminating the most aesthetic son for considering shock acceleration as the principal means of energizing cosmic rays
nevertheless such acceleration is virtually inevitable at the interface between supersonic and subsonic ows and hence is widely accepted to be ubiquitous in astrophysical systems by theorists and experimentalists alike
non linear shock acceleration eects and their implications featured prominently in the contributed papers and are suitably discussed in the reviews of
when the accelerated ions have sucient pressure to modify the ow dynamics in the shock environs they can no longer be considered as test particles
the cosmic ray ions act to slow down the ow upstream of the shock discontinuity resulting in an increase of the overall compression ratio r above the canonical test particle value of r if the system sustains signicant losses of particles or energy
this strengthening of the shock adds to the non thermal ion pressure modifying the ow speed further and thereby provides a feedback that denes the non linearity of the acceleration process
such non linear eects are present in snr shocks because they are inherently strong have had sucient time at least in the sedov phase to accumulate signicant pressure in the cosmic rays and suer losses on the largest spatial scales
electrons seldom contribute to the dynamics e

unless they possess a peculiarly large abundance relative to the cosmic ray e p ratio of in the gev range
a principal signature of these non linearities in strong snr shocks is the upward spectral curvature in the non thermal ions a consequence of higher energy ions generally having larger diusive scales and thereby sampling greater eective compression ratios in the cosmic ray modied ow
concomitantly the tion is enhanced with increasing mass to charge a q ratio implying a relative profusion of higher metallicity species that was salient for the cosmic ray origin discussion above
berezhko ksenofontov og

and ellison et al
og

illustrate such predictions of non linear acceleration theory and emphasize that spectral curvature is consistent with all particle or individual species data given the signicant experimental spread below the knee an argument supported by zatsepin sokolskaya og


this line of reasoning is obviously at odds with the common wisdom that the cosmic ray spectrum is a beautiful power law
merit can be found in both perspectives which are not inherently incompatible the spectral curvature predicted is suciently small enhancements by a factor of a few over several decades in energy that it essentially can not be discriminated from exact power laws as an appropriate model for the cosmic ray spectrum below the knee
in any case since the cosmic ray measurements represent a convolution of source properties and propagation characteristics such a distinction loses ing
in this regard gamma ray signatures in the gev to tev band from isolated remnants will be more informative in seeking evidence of spectral curvature
the critical point for discussion is that spectral cutos expected in snrs ally around tev see berezhko volk og

yoshida yanagita og

could impose structure in the cosmic ray spectrum more severe than observed near the knee
this is a principal outstanding problem for cosmic ray studies its resolution requires more detailed spectral and compositional tion in the vicinity of the knee the access project should help provide this
the kascade air shower experiment provided some interesting results salient to this issue namely deductions of proton and fe spectra from muon data haungs et al
he

chilingarian et al
he


complementary inferences from gamma ray upper limits casa mia results marko et al
og

hegra observations horns et al
og

are currently not constraining
non linear acceleration induced spectral curvature obviously will impose more severe requirements on propagation models both by requiring a stronger dence of the escape length on rigidity and by increasing diculties in minimizing anisotropies of the highest energy particles in the galaxy
another non linear feature is the reduction of the compression ratio of the viscous subshock i
e
shock tinuity below r thereby reducing the dissipational heating of the downstream plasma ellison berezhko og


this property is pertinent to the pretation of x ray line emission from snrs computations of x ray bremsstrahlung in snr emission models and the deduced electron to proton ratio the latter impacts the gamma ray ux expected from remnants
several papers were devoted to such astrophysical signatures and are discussed below
the injection issue was the subject of two papers gieseler jones kang og

and sugiyama fujimoto og

though neither paper treated tron injection a perennial concern for theorists
gieseler et al
developed kang jones diusion convection equation approach to modelling acceleration at linear shocks by incorporating a description due to malkov of the interaction of thermal ions with self generated magneto hydrodynamic mhd waves
it is clear what advantages this step has to oer over antecedent developments by kang jones that parameterized injection eciencies e

see og

which cussed an interesting use of an adaptive mesh technique to improve the dynamic range of lengthscales that can be probed
the injection formalism incorporated in og

is based on quasi linear theory which has limited applicability to lence in the environs of strong modied shocks
sugiyama fujimoto simulated jection in such strong turbulence by computing ion motions in large amplitude mhd waves using techniques employed in hybrid and full plasma simulations
their test particle investigation of essentially coherent acceleration in time dependent tric elds in the shock neighbourhood yielded expected results which are usually generated by more complete plasma simulations reviewed in namely that suprathermal ions are produced in signicant numbers on timescales considerably larger than the ion gyroperiod
such coherent eects are an integral part of the dissipational heating in the shock layers and naturally provide injection that seeds diusive acceleration at higher energies
from a small pot pourri of papers treating diverse acceleration problems i wish to highlight two contributions before proceeding to the astrophysically oriented ferings
the rst was the presentation of a simple analytic model of non linear acceleration in plane parallel shocks by ellison berezhko og

specifying a complete and continuous particle distribution via a thermal component plus a three piece broken power law representing non thermal ions
the power law slopes energies of connection between the various spectral portions and the normalization coecients are self consistently determined in a modelling of the ow ics only the eciency of injection from thermal energies need be specied as a parameter
the model possesses great potential for astrophysical applications due to its facility and agrees well with more complete predictions of monte carlo and kinetic transport equation techniques
the second interesting result was in the discussion by drury et al
og

og

of pile ups in cosmic ray electron source distributions near the imum i
e
cuto energy due to signicant synchrotron losses
this issue has had various preceding treatments with the conclusion that only test particle shocks with compression ratios r could yield a build up of electrons near the cooling cuto i
e
an improbable occurrence
the new feature of drury et al
s work is that momentum dependent diusion scales are treated so that synchrotron cooling of electrons suciently remote downstream from the shock can result in losses from the system additional to those due to convection
the criterion for build ups relaxes to r
generating an interesting regime of phase space where strong shocks potentially can yield these spectral bumps
essentially pile ups arise when mentum losses in cooling outpace the spatial losses that are integral in determining the index of the canonical test particle distribution
such pile up considerations could prove very relevant to the interpretation of non thermal x ray emission and tev gamma ray spectra from snrs
astrophysical applications supernova remnants were the dominant subject of astrophysical applications of acceleration theory
while dynamical calculations of cosmic ray acceleration at snr shocks and limited models of radio to gamma ray emission from these cles have been around for a long time this eld has really burgeoned in the last half decade following the detection by the egret experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory of a number of unidentied gev ray sources with snr celestial associations and the subsequent campaigns by atmospheric cerenkov telescopes to search for tev emission from ous prime candidate remnants see and buckley s rapporteur paper in these proceedings for reviews of this eld
the eld now possesses conrmed detections in non thermal x rays and tev gamma rays in a few sources an enviable position compared with the status years ago
the models have rapidly become more phisticated and complete in their radiation predictions
two alternative techniques are at the forefront of this acceleration problem both being represented at the conference i berezhko et al
s semi analytic solution of the time dependent spherical transport equation for ions and ellison baring and collaborators use of a monte carlo simulation of diusive acceleration
these approaches each have their virtues and limitations
berezkho et al
s method handles all the time dependent eects self consistently but requires a parametric specication of injection whereas the monte carlo simulation which automatically injects ions from the thermal populations models steady state parallel shocks and incorporates eects of time dependence through a hybridization involving sedov evolution of shock parameters
both methods must parameterize electron injection an position due to current shortcomings in acceleration theory
there is a remarkable convergence of results from these two complementary models as is patently evident in the spectral comparison presented by ellison berezhko og


while there are some ne scale dissimilarities this global agreement has led to a fairly robust set of predictions for radio x ray and gamma ray astronomy embodied in the conference papers of berezhko and volk og

berezhko ksenofontov petukhov og

and ellison et al
og


principal features include the virtual constancy and peaking of the maximum particle energy and gamma ray luminosity throughout the sedov epoch og

og

and prominent pion decay emission for high circumstellar densities in both the gev and tev wavebands for ambient elds approaching mg synchrotron cooling is sucient to render such hadronic emission dominant in the super tev range ellison et al
og

and berezhko volk og

who also explore remnant properties for explosions in wind bubbles spawned by massive progenitors
such pion decay signatures are potentially almost biguous evidence of the presence of cosmic rays in supernova remnants
the quest for such a proof of cosmic ray acceleration in snrs is of primal importance to the cosmic ray community
acquisition of this evidence seems imminent given the impending ground based and spaced based gamma ray experiments scheduled to come on line in the next years
theory is currently well placed to interpret the anticipated wealth of new information to be aorded by these programs
there was a marked paucity of papers addressing relativistic shocks at the ference
this was in spite of considerable recent interest in their acceleration erties by modellers of the topical gamma ray burst grb phenomenon and the probable relevance to generation of ultra high energy cosmic rays
baring og

provided the principal oering at the conference on acceleration predictions at relativistic shocks highlighting the major needs for grb theorists quantifying the injection eciency particularly for electrons and determining the spectral index which is not uniquely specied in terms of the shock compression ratio and the time and maximum energy of acceleration
none of these properties can be discerned easily and there is a major need to redress such gaps in our knowledge
baring explored spectral dierences between large angle scattering and pitch gle diusion in ultrarelativistic plane parallel shocks i
e
those with bulk lorentz factor and conrmed the nding of bednarz ostrowski that in the case of pitch angle diusion the power law spectrum for accelerated cles approaches approximately
as the shock speed asymptotes to the speed of light
ostrowski og

discussed the possibility of acceleration at shear layers bordering relativistic jets in active galaxies
as intuitively expected he served the acceleration to be rapid due to large kinematic boosts acquired when particles diuse between the jet and surrounding medium
yet no indication of the eciency of injection was proered and it is unclear that this type of boundary layer acceleration can be very eective in the presence of shear turbulence that is naturally established in jet entrainment of the surrounding ambient material
it is also uncertain whether such kinematic boosts to particle energies in either of these extragalactic environs can enhance the sources ability to generate cosmic rays with e ev an issue that should be the focus of future research
ultra high energy cosmic rays the study of ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs bridges the interests of cosmic ray physicists and astrophysicists
while the perennial problem of what is the metallicity of ev cosmic rays i
e
protons vs
fe remains focus at this meeting was centered on the highest energy ones namely those around and above ev
this subject the greisen zatsepin kuzmin gzk cuto at was driven largely by the recent announcement takeda et al
that there is a signicant excess of cosmic rays above the gzk cuto with events now detected mostly agasa data above ev
papers at the meeting can be categorized as those discussing arrival directions and those addressing spectral issues
stanev and hillas og

provided a detailed statistical analysis of arrival directions for events with energies e eev exploring possible associations and anisotropies on various angular scales
their conclusions were that there is no signicant correlation between uhecr directions and those of extragalactic supernovae and that there was only a marginal enhancement of uhecr ux near ion deections in galactic and extragalactic magnetic the supergalactic plane
elds clearly de correlate directions of prospective sources and observed events nicantly
tkaczyk og

posited upper limits to the neutron content of via analysis of their anisotropy using the fact that neutrons are ected by these magnetic elds
stanev and hillas did indicate however that there was signicant clustering on angular scales less than primarily spawned by two uhecr triplets pair groupings were not unusually numerous
the auger and owl projects will obviously increase the database dramatically and improve such statistical analyses immeasurably
directional information was also a focus of horns et al
og

who used data from the hegra scintillation array to search for high energy gamma ray associations with uhecr events and tant anisotropies
one particular marginal association stood out a excess in the sky at gamma ray energy of ev coincident with the arrival direction of the eev fly s eye cosmic ray
in a paper supporting this directional analysis horns og

simulated electromagnetic cascades initiated by uhecrs
two discussions relating to extragalactic source spatial distributions were fered by ptuskin rogovaya zirakashvili og

and medina tanco og


these two works focused on explaining the excess implied by the uhecr observations with essentially the same premise natural clustering of galaxies provides source densities that exceed on small distance scales the average density for a uniform homogeneous spatial distribution
this property obviously weights the calculation of cosmic ray cooling by photo pion production on the microwave background and permits a population of uhecrs above the traditional gzk ev
both groups eectively assumed that cosmic ray production o at rates trace galaxy luminosity to some extent since the latter underpins ical detectability
ptuskin et al
and medina tanco reached the same conclusion that the galaxy distributions can permit cosmic ray distributions commensurate with the observed spectrum thereby resolving any purported observation theory discrepancy
their conclusion was arrived at by dierent analyses ptuskin et al
invoked a fractal distribution of galaxies as a mathematically motivated tion of clustering while medina tanco made use of the data collection of the cfa survey at redshifts z

hence the bottom line here is that there appears to be no need to seek a galactic connection for the ev events
papers addressing the actual source of uhecrs were exceedingly sparse with the only oerings being the galactic scenarios of olinto epstein blasi og

and blasi og


olinto et al
envisage neutron stars acting as sources of ultra high energy fe stripped o the stellar surfaces by intense electric elds induced by rotation
key properties of their picture include a very at source spectrum modelling structure around and above the ankle in the cosmic ray trum and of course a heavy metallicity of the uhecr population
conditions for minimal eects of energy degradation of accelerated fe nuclei on the surrounding pre ejecta are achieved for fast rotators i
e
millisecond pulsars
their model has a number of attractive features however its viability is contingent upon the ease with which iron can be stripped from the star this issue is somewhat controversial in the pulsar community with skeptics in the majority appealing to the large work function of fe to argue their case
blasi og

suggested an exotic origin super heavy dark matter in the galactic halo comprising lated quasi stable particles that are relics of the early universe
these particles are purported to spawn neutral and charged pions in spontaneous decays so that electromagnetic signatures are generated principally gamma rays in the mev range appropriate for exploration by the proposed glast experiment
this scenario suers from the drawback that it is dicult to discriminate spectrally its predictions from those of more mainstream origins of diuse emission
in a lated paper medina tanco watson og

indicated that present statistical limitations on uhecr anisotropies preclude discrimination between various dark matter halo distributions
due to the proximity of their sources neither of these origin scenarios need to address so called gzk violations
future directions to conclude it is appropriate to identify a list of salient tasks for the cosmic ray community relating to the subjects discussed here
for origin composition ists the question of how old the seed material is still remains and a reconciliation of ace data constraints with inferences from the libeb problem is needed
data it is also on actinide abundances should help probe matter mixing timescales
important to determine whether o metallicity is a better indicator than fe h for the libeb problem
for the propagation community extending the data range of unstable secondary to primary ratios to span the trans relativistic regime gev nucleon will help discriminate between propagation models while ace has made progress here we await future ights of isomax
improving spectra and composition studies around the knee are clearly a major priority for the acceleration community to discern how eective snrs are at accelerating up to these energies
a related issue is the search for pion decay signatures in gamma ray emission from remnants which would provide the rst unequivocal proof that snrs are indeed the galactic sites of acceleration the opportunity for this resolution seems nent
on the theoretical side three dimensional plasma simulations are desperately needed to elucidate the electron injection problem and considerable investment in the study of acceleration at relativistic shocks would advance the astrophysics of active galaxies and gamma ray bursts
for the uhecr eld it is anticipated that the database increase due to auger and owl projects will provide a clearer picture of the spectral anisotropy and clustering properties of such high energy particles enabling discrimination between various postulates of their origin
