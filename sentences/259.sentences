fr january abstract the amount of user generated contents from various social medias allows analyst to handle a wide view of conversations on several topics related to their business
nevertheless keeping up to date with this amount of information is not humanly feasible
automatic summarization then provides an interesting mean to digest the dynamics and the mass volume of contents
in this paper we address the issue of tweets summarization which remains scarcely explored
we propose to automatically generated summaries of micro blogs conversations dealing with public gures e reputation
these summaries are generated using key word queries or sample tweet and offer a focused view of the whole micro blog network
since state of the art is lacking on this point we conduct and ate our experiments over the multilingual clef replab topic detection dataset according to an experimental evaluation process
introduction the amount of the information collectively generated by users on online social networks have drastically increased ing these last years
and online social interactions provide a real time reect of real world events on people opinions but frequently remains unprocessed due to the sheer quantities of it
hence understanding social events become cial for entities concerned with their online reputation
these entities typically spend a lot of money to obtain reliable satisfaction polls using call centers and surveys and online social networks are certainly carrying key information to anticipate and react to the versatility of public opinions
the high volume of conversations and the velocity of answers make impossible to keep up to date with all events of interests related to a specic business
considering this amount a preprint of ijcla january of documents automatic approaches are needed
more precisely automatic text summarization appears indispensable to cope with the increasing amount of information
an increasing number of social media analysis sma services and community managers use micro blog streams to analyze keep in touch with the market mood
twitter offers the trends service and if social event detection itself has already been studied it does not end story
indeed it does only provide cues of the existence of these events and an access to the last related tweets either they are really informative or not
as well as usual generic summarization will always provide the same global abstract from a pool of tweets
end users are then not aware to capture the main information to completely understand what this event is about
and probably the most crucial aspect what are twitter users saying about this event
towards this goal we are interested in using these events as queries to produce guided automatic summaries of the tweets streams
considered queries could be a topic conceptual topic a cluster label or even a sample tweet illustrating the topic
the main objective is to allow business analyst to quickly digest the focused information avoiding the peculiar choice of keywords and concepts denition which is non accessible to non technical person
this problem can also be considered as a question answering qa issue where system has to exactly answer a question expressed in natural language
qa systems are confronted with a ne and difcult task because they are expected to supply specic information and not whole documents or pools of documents
currently there exists a strong demand for this kind of text processing systems on the internet
a qa system comprises a the following stages transform the questions into queries then associate them to a set of documents filter and sort these documents to compute various degrees of similarity identify the sentences which might contain the answers then extract text fragments from those that constitute the answers
in this phase an analysis using named entities ne is essential to nd the expected answers
search engine are more about answering queries whatever their form while in our case topic label can be very and sometimes words from the queries are even absent from the contents when the query is about ethics or tion
as such we conduct an experimental evaluation for query driven micro blogs summarization
we investigate different statistical summarization systems evaluated with fresa for summarization informativity and map for the ranking and information retrieval aspect
the rest of this paper is organized as follows section provides related works in automatic summarization and blogs summarization
in section we discuss the issue and provide details about our approaches
a discussion of our results is provided in section
finally section gives our conclusions on our work and open several perspectives
related work an abstract is by far the most concrete and most recognized kind of text condensation
we adopted a simple method usually called extraction that allows to generate summaries by extracting relevant sentences
essentially this extraction aims at producing a shorter version of the text by selecting the most relevant sentences of the original text which we juxtapose without any modication
the vector space model has been used in information extraction information retrieval ir qa and it may also be used in text summarization
most research efforts in summarization emphasize generic summarization
user query terms are monly used in ir tasks
however there are few papers in literature that propose to employ this approach in rization systems
in the systems described in a learning approach is performed
a document set is used to train a classier that estimates the probability that a given sentence has to be included in the extract
in several features document title location of a sentence in the document cluster of signicant words and occurrence of terms present in the query are applied to score the sentences
in learning and feature approaches are combined in a two step system a training system and a generator system
score features include short length sentence sentence position in the document sentence position in the paragraph and tf
idf metrics
recent works integrate more sophisticated methods from machine learning ml and natural language processing nlp elds
automatically summarizing micro blogs conversation is a relatively new area of research
it recently attracted several research teams in europe used to focus on automatic summarization of events
with their dataset on tweet sized specic summaries became a reference to benchmark micro blogs summarization approaches
which by the way also inspired who focused on soccer match summarization
partly using the same datasets mackie et al
proposed a comparative evaluation of different summarization methods and looked for the most effective evaluation metrics from these summarization methods
a preprint of ijcla january these works intended to be representative but their evaluation was event detection centered since their purpose was to nd the most relevant tweet with regards to the given event
although detecting goals with the mass of tweets on a specic topic in a short period of the timeline appears to be solved producing a summary of the defense efciency during the match which is nearer usual micro blogs summarization scenarios is still a wile open door
summarizing micro blogs can be viewed as an instance of automated text summarization which is the problem of automatically generating a condensed version of the most important content from a pool of contents a long document or several documents
this summary can be generated for a particular user or to answer a specic question this is called guided or personalized summarization
having as purpose to group tweets regarding their usefulness to a given topic wen and marshall proposed to digest twitter trending topics using hidden markov models to rank the most important tweets related to each of their selected topics
problem statement and selected approaches we dene the micro blogs summarization issue as the task that given a pool of tweets and a user generated query provides a focused view of the pool
the query is a real world complex question called long query answering in which the answer is a summary constructed from a set of relevant documents
in the authors also focused on event detection
in our case the selected events are given by the user and its impact is two fold first the user could give a non relevant query which means there are no tweets or only one tweet from the pool that answer his query or a too generic query which in this case can be answered by a too larger set of tweets secondly a given tweet could answer two different queries and this information may not be in the reference our objective is to use summarizers as tweets selector
the systems are provided tweets from those they have to chose the most representative ones that answer the query but also contains information from the complete pool
so the user is able to understand the why s and wherefores
below we compare two tweets selection methods and we test them with a set of provided queries
our generic summarization system includes a set of eleven independent metrics combined by a decision algorithm
query based summaries can be generated by our systems using a modication of the scoring method
in both cases no training phase is necessary in our system

cortex summarizer cortex is a single document extract summarization system
it uses an optimal decision algorithm that bines several metrics
these metrics result from processing statistical and informational algorithms on the document vector space representation
the idea is to represent the text in an appropriate vectorial space and apply numeric treatments to it
in order to reduce complexity a pre processing is performed on the question and the document words are ltered lemmatized and stemmed
the cortex system uses metrics see for a detailed description of these metrics to evaluate the sentence s relevance
for instance the topic sentence overlap measure assigns a higher ranking for the sentences containing question words and makes selected sentences more relevant
the overlap is dened as the normalized cardinality of the intersection between the query word set t and the sentence word set s
the system scores each sentence with a decision algorithm that relies on the normalized metrics
before combining the votes of the metrics these have been split into two sets one set contains every metric i
while the other set contains every metric i
values equal to
are ignored
we then compute two values and which give the sum of distances positive for and negative for to the threshold
the number of metrics is which is in our experiment s t i
i
x a preprint of ijcla january the value given to each sentence s given a query q is calculated with
i i
x then q
else q
the cortex system is applied to each document of a topic and the summary is generated by concatenating higher score sentences

artex artex computes the score of each sentence by calculating the inner product between a sentence vector an averagepseudo sentence vector the global topic and an averagepseudo word vector the lexical weight
the summary is generated concatenating the sentences with the highest scores
an average document vector which represents the global topic of all sentences vectors is constructed
the lexical weight for each sentence i
e
the number of words in the sentence is obtained
a score for each sentence is calculated using their proximity with the global topic and their lexical weight
let


be a vector of the sentence



the average pseudo word vector was dened as the average number of occurrences of n words used in the sentence n x j bj x and the averagepseudo sentence vector bj as the average number of occurrences of each word j used through the sentences the weight of each sentence is calculated as follows finally a random summarizer was implemented in order to create a baseline system
this baseline system picks sentences at random from the tweet set
a random value in the range was assigned to each sentence i
experimental setup and evaluation in this section we describe the experimental evaluation that we undertake to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to address the following question
for a given query are automatic summarizers able to retrieve and return as summary tweets which were manually selected as answering this query
how much the returned tweets are informative regarding the expect set of tweets and the complete pool we use the topic detection task where we are given a set of tweets concerning each entity and experts queries to evaluate our proposal
that is to say given a query to propose an overview of entity s e reputation using provided micro blog contents

replab collection we conducted our evaluation using the replab bilingual collection which includes more than tweets spread in clusters
the collection covers a set of entities from economic domains automotive artists banking and universities
more details about the collection and its annotation are available in
are available at
uned
a preprint of ijcla january we will consider the clusters as queries for the rest of this paper
for each entity around tweets are provided with a set of queries with around tweets per query
queries address a large set of facts events conversations songs or products comments news reports

we dismissed all queries having more than related tweets such as trash called other topics and less than tweets in this case the query should be the tweet which leads to a total number of queries of
we kept queries with very similar labels such as pictures on social network and photo in social network
note that all queries are in english even if all answering tweets are in spanish

evaluation protocol evaluating summaries is known to be a challenging part
in this work the reference summaries for the systems summaries to evaluate against are the clusters dened by the specialists from llorente a leading spanish e reputation rm
clusters are groups of tweets that are related by a common theme
they represent a focused view of the entity e reputation regarding this theme
we considered a step evaluation
first we evaluate the quality of the tweets hierarchy where we expect our system the return as n rst tweets those that were tagged by the experts as belonging to the cluster labeled with the query
ranking quality is estimated separately for each query using the mean average precision map
map allows comparing an ordered vector output of a submitted method to a binary reference manually annotated data
the map is computed as follows m ap n n x where n is the total number of tweets n the number of tweets correctly found i
e
true positives the precision at rank i i
e
when considering the rst i tweets found and is if the ith tweets is related to the query and otherwise
then based on the hierarchy we select the rst sentences to compose the summary
in order to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries we compare our proposed summaries to the reference summary using fresa
fresa a framework for evaluating summaries automatically is a method based on information theory which evaluates summaries without using human references
fresa is based on the works of
fresa calculates the divergence between a source text p and a summary q via n grams statistics grams grams grams and their
we also propose to compute fresa between the automatic summaries and reference summary and the initial set of document to estimate an informativity

performances the main goal of our evaluation was to verify if automatic summarizers are efcient enough to provide a reduced set of tweets which is informative enough regarding a given query
table shows the fresa score between the summarizers and the source documents which is the total pool of tweets
the way the replab was built lead to very scores when it comes to compare the manual references for a given query to the complete pool of tweets
clusters where made of tweets that are only focusing on a specic event without concerns to the rest of the pool while summarizer tried to include a part of background information
summarizer reference cortex artex baseline



table fresa results summarizers vs test corpora
during the annotation process tweets were grouped in clusters with a various size from to and then annotators selected a label from the cluster which represent the main concept the query expressed in the cluster
on complicate queries where many misunderstandings can take place once the process was done if some tweets were more relevant regarding another cluster they were switched to this new cluster
table shows the fresa score between the summarizers and the human reference corpora
in order to see which of the tweets selected by summarizers are relevant we computed the map to compare rizers ranking to the human reference

choosing tweets and affecting them weights obviously perform really bad with regards to the map since there is almost no chance to put the expected tweets at the heading ranks

we consider a query which all systems reported at least one relevant tweets annie le s family sues yale this query refers to a student that was murdered on the campus of the yale university
map obtained by the systems are


respectively for artex cortex and the baseline
fresa values for this particular query are

and

the summarizers expecting the baseline returned the following content report annie le s family sues yale university after grad student s killing new haven ct the family of a slain ya


as most relevant tweet mainly because the query itself was extracted from the tweets
then if artex also extracted more tweets related to this event cortex found tweets concerning other campus matters
table shows the number of query for which summarizer had an a non null map that is to say for this queries systems were able to select at least one relevant within the top documents returned
the baseline low map performance is also illustrated here with a very small number of non null queries
summarizer cortex artex baseline table number of queries having a non null map
this low performance can be caused by the queries and references characteristics
we should investigate both erties effects on the summarization performance
indeed according to our experiments cortex was able to produce summaries informative with regard to the complete set of tweets which means it would be able to obtain greater formances over vague queries which have more than relevant tweets
alternatively artex obtained interesting performance in selecting the most relevant tweets for queries having a limited number of tweets
another aspect is that the reference is limited since a tweet belongs to one and one only query
it then seems obvious since there are very similar queries
we also do not considered a decision strategy over all queries
that is to say when a tweet appears to be very relevant to one query the system should avoid it when computing the scores for the others queries
according to the way the reference is built it would lead to better performances nevertheless it will imply to drift from the original search problem
conclusive discussion in this paper we conducted extensive experiments on a real world dataset proposed by the clef replab lenge
one of the challenge proposed was to identify a group of tweets that can explain a particular query
such information retrieval or search task can be evaluated as a traditional ranking information retrieval problem
in other words systems will be a ranking of tweets where the most relevant appear at the rst position of the returned list of tweets
for each entity from replab we used the topics proposed by e watcher specialists as queries to build automatic summaries of the tweets steam
these summaries reect how does people perceive the entity with regard to this topic but also what do they mainly say about this topic
we have presented rather simple statistical summarizers without knowledge which obtained interesting performances in this complex guided summarization task according to our evaluation
the performed experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are able to catch differences between tweets with regard to the queries
a preprint of ijcla january maybe more then summarizing social medias contents evaluating the quality of these automatically generated maries is an important research issue
besides keeping up to date with the last information systems have to deal with contents informativity and to provide the most interesting tweets in order to help the end user to answer his query
nevertheless manually generating reference summaries for each possible query is not possible
moreover as the issue is still relatively young we are also lacking a specic automatic evaluation framework for this task
the main contribution of this paper is nally to draw the base line of query based automatic summarization of blogs and its evaluation
our intuition is that by guessing the expected queries we are able to summarize the tweets stream and in this way ease a later clustering or classication stage
instead of working at a single tweet granularity systems would be able to handle a summarized cluster
in the future we intend to extend the process by automatically generating summaries from the most informative tweets
this way for each query we will allow the user to handle a short readable piece of text
