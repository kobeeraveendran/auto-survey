miller a adepartment of physics university of washington seattle washington usa high energy scattering experiments involving nuclei are typically analyzed in terms of light front variables
the desire to provide realistic relativistic wave functions expressed in terms of these variables led me to try to use light front dynamics to compute nuclear wave functions
the progress is summarized here

introduction much of nuclear physics is concerned with the transition between nucleon meson and quark gluon degrees of freedom with deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering drell yan production and high energy e ep and p pp reactions being some of the tools of vestigation
since high energies are involved it is absolutely necessary to incorporate relativity
our project is to implement poincare invariance in nuclear physics by using light front dynamics
this is useful in analyzing experiments because the canonical mentum variable is closely related to experimental observables
the challenge is to use these variables while incorporating the dynamical richness necessary to properly describe nuclei
consider the plus momentum distributions fb m which give the ability that a nuclear baryon b or meson m has a plus momentum of
if the relevant nuclear wave functions depend on the canonical spatial variable is x
this leaves to be used as a time variable
thus the light front dynamics is very dierent than the usual dynamics
if this light front formalism is used m are simply related to the square of the ground state nuclear wave function
thus the use of light front dynamics provides vast simplicities provided one can obtain the ground state wave function using realistic lagrangians and many body techniques
it is easier to carry out such a program for the eective hadronic lagrangians of nuclear physics than for qcd because hadrons all have a non zero mass and because the vacuum is not a condensed state of nucleon anti nucleon pairs
another advantage is that the fock state expansion of the wave function is in terms of on shell particles
the remainder is meant to present a brief outline of the progress
the main goal is to provide a series of examples to show that the light front can be used for high energy realistic nuclear physics
this work is partially supported by the usdoe

light front quantization of hadronic lagrangians you have to have a lagrangian l no matter how bad
we use ones in which the degrees of freedom are nucleons vector and scalar mesons and pions
the existence of l allows the derivation of the canonical symmetric energy momentum tensor t
in light front dynamics the momentum is p p p where p is the total momentum operator r t
the development operator is p
one necessary detail is p that that t must be expressed in terms of independent degrees of freedom
one uses the equations of motion to express the dependent degrees of freedom in terms of the independent ones and uses these constraint equations in the expression for t
except for chiral lagrangians the necessary quantization procedure has been carried out long ago by other

infinite nuclear matter in mean field approximation plus momentum distributions the rst problem we tried to solve is that of understanding nuclear matter in the mean eld approximation using the walecka model
this problem has been solved in a manifestly covariant so that the existing results for the energy of the system provide a useful check of our light front procedure
we are able to reproduce the standard results
the interesting feature of light front dynamics that one is able to calculate the momentum distributions
for this simple problem we found that the nuclear vector mesons carry about a third of the nuclear plus momentum but their momentum distribution has support only at

thus the vector mesons do not contribute to nuclear deep inelastic scattering
this zero mode eect occurs because in the mean eld approximation the meson elds of an innite system are constant in both space and time
this is an intriguing result which is caused by the large values of the scalar and vector potentials which are characteristic of the walecka model
the nucleons carry only of the nuclear plus momentum a result in severe disagreement with deep inelastic scattering data
it is necessary to see if it survives for the case of nite sized nuclei and if correlations between nucleons are included

finite nuclei in mean field approximation we that the necessary variational principle is a constrained one which xes the expectation value of the total momentum operator p to be the same as that for p
this is the same as minimizing the sum of the total momentum operators p
a new light front version of the equation for the single nucleon modes was obtained and a new numerical technique for their solution was introduced
the ground state wave function is treated as a meson nucleon fock state and the meson elds are treated as expectation values of eld operators in that ground state
the resulting equations for these expectation values was shown to be closely related to the usual meson eld equations
the computed binding energies are essentially the same as for the usual equal time theory
the nucleon plus momentum distribution fn peaks for about seventy percent of the nucleon mass which again is far too small to be consistent with deep inelastic scattering data
the mesonic component of the ground state wave function was used to determine the scalar and vector meson momentum distribution functions and the vector mesons were found to carry about thirty percent of the nuclear plus momentum
we are currently investigating other lagrangians which lead to smaller magnitudes of scalar and vector potentials and therefore yield better descriptions of the deep inelastic scattering data

pions and chiral symmetry light front quantization of a chiral lagrangian can be performed if one uses a grangian due to
pion nucleon scattering at tree level was shown to reproduce soft pion theorems
nucleon nucleon scattering the weinberg type is the light front version of the lippman schwinger equation
this equation is equivalent to the the blankenbecler sugar equation except that retardation eects need to be
our hadronic chiral lagrangian was to obtain a light front version of a one boson exchange nucleon nucleon potential obep
the accuracy of our description of the nucleon nucleon nn data is good and similar to that of other relativistic obep models

nuclear matter with nucleon nucleon correlations the trivial nature of the vacuum in the light front formalism was exploited in the equations analogous to the the hartree fock and brueckner hartree fock equations
applying our light front obep the nuclear matter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced
the computed value of the compressibility mev is smaller than that of alternative relativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually comes out too large
we showed that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by a nn interaction is a consistent approximation and that the formalism allows one to calculate corrections to this approximation in a well organized manner
the mesonic fock space components of the nuclear wave function are studied also and aspects of the meson and nucleon plus momentum distribution functions are computed
we nd that there are about
excess pions per nucleon
the magnitudes of the scalar and vector potentials are far smaller than found in the mean eld approximation
if we neglect the inuence of two particle two hole states to approximate the nucleons are found to carry as opposed to the of mean eld theory of the nuclear plus momentum
this represents a vast improvement in the description of nuclear deep inelastic scattering as the minimum value of the ratio is increased by a factor of twenty towards the data which is not enough to provide a satisfactory description
we can be optimistic about future results because including nucleons with momentum greater than kf would substantially increase the computed ratio since decreases very rapidly with increasing values of and because m would increase at high momenta turn now to the experimental information about the nuclear pionic content
the yan experiment on nuclear targets showed no enhancement of nuclear pions within an error of about for their heaviest target
understanding this result is an important challenge to the understanding of nuclear dynamics
here we have a good description of nuclear dynamics and our enhancement is within errors with the drell yan data

summary the light front approach has now been applied to innite nuclear matter in the mean eld approximation nite sized nuclei in the same approximation n and nn ing and to correlated nucleons in innite nuclear matter thus it seems that one can use the light front approach to compute nuclear energies wave functions and the tally important plus momentum distributions
there are indications that the computed quantities will ultimately be in good agreement with experiment
but the use of light front dynamics in nuclear physics is only in its infancy and much remains to be done to understand nuclear deep inelastic data the future expected ood of data on the e ep and p pp reactions
