br abstract of on probabilities this paper aims to introduces a new algorithm for automatic speech to text statistical summarization based divergences and graphs
the input is a text from speech conversations with noise and the output a compact text summary
our results on the pilot task cccs multiling french corpus are very encouraging
keywords automatic text summarization jensen shannon s divergence of probabilities speech to text summarization graph model
introduction nowadays a lot of information is daily generated
it is necessary to have available memory storage because each datum must be processed and the the information contained therein analyzed
is manual analysis is impossible because it necessary a huge number of persons to analyze this information in an available time
the summary is a short text with main ideas of original text torres moreno and reduces the read time to analyze these data
in news audio is widely used in daily life on the interviews radio and on the internet and conversations
a call centre conversation creates a lot of conversations every day
these centers has issues and tasks
it is essential the control of the discussed topics and the results obtained by customers in these calls
one way to analyze and accelerate the data processing is speech summarization that is different from traditional text summarization because there are other problems in these texts as speech errors sentences of different sizes and colloquialisms
multiling is a community driven initiative for benchmarking multilingual summarization systems nurturing further research and pushing the state of the art in the area
the multiling initiative features the following tasks multilingual multi document summarization multilingual single document summarization online forum summarization and call centre conversation summarization cccs
the cccs pilot task consists in creating systems that can analyze call centres conversations and generate written summaries reecting why the customer is calling how the agent answers that query what are the steps to solve the problem and what is the resolution status of the problem favre et al

we developed the lia rag summarization system based on the rag system pontes et al
coupled with some post processing rules in order to generate a nal summary
lia rag uses a graph model to analyze and verify a set of documents e

the conversation transcription for cccs pilot task
lia rag creates a summary computing the relevance of the words and the similarity among the sentences
the system uses a simple post processing to improve the quality of the nal summary
of the rest of the paper is organized as follows section describes related work on automatic summarization conversations
texts sections and analyze the graph model and the system used in this work
section describes the results obtained for multiling decoda french corpus and section concludes this work

v i x r a related works automatic text summarization ats aims to creates a summary containing the main ideas of a textual document mani and mayburi mani torres moreno
the summary can be an extraction or abstraction of a single document or multi document
the extraction process identies the most informative sentences of a document and creates a summary by assembling of these sentences luhn torres moreno
extraction may be guided in this case the algorithm selects by a query
the most relevant information follow a particular topic
the abstraction algorithms create new or reformulate sentences from original texts seno seno and nunes and the extraction methods use the key sentences of texts barzilay and mckeown torres moreno
works about abstraction usually uses syntactic and semantic knowledge of a language to create the summary
this procedure veries the best construction of a sentence barzilay et al

this type of summarization uses fusion to help the review of information
seno proposed a method to fusion similar sentences in brazilian portuguese based on a symbolic and domain independent approach
this method allows the fusion by union and by intersection of a document cluster
fusion by union preserves the overall message of the cluster while fusion by intersection analyses the redundant information considered most in the cluster
seno and nunes described how to identify common information between sentences in brazilian portuguese using lexical knowledge syntactic and semantic rules of paraphrasing
important jorge et al
developed a summarizer system based on the cst model cross document structure theory
the system proposed analyses redundancy and contradiction among different information sources in brazilian portuguese
barzilay et al
developed a method to generate automatic summaries by identifying and synthesizing similar elements in a cluster of documents
this method creates the summary based on similarity between the sentences and topic
barzilay and mckeown described an approach to fusion sentences through the to synthesize repeated text to text information from multiple documents
this method uses a syntactic alignment in sentences technique to identify common information
the identication step sentences are processed and a new text is generated with the same content
after metrics similarity a way to calculate the similarity between sentences is to use co occurrence of words
he et al
proposed a fusion method using co occurrence skip bigram and information density to evaluate relevant sentences hennig and albayrak developed ones
a multi document model to summarize by analyzing the co occurrence of sentence term and sentence bigram using the jensen shannon js divergence
and to select the most another method to obtain relevant sentences uses compression as reported in pitler
pitler uses approaches based on syntactic trees sentences and discourse
filippova describes a multi sentence compression method using a word based graph
the summarization by extraction does not have the same quality as the summaries produced by abstraction because it uses surface methods based on statistical calculations to verify the sentence relevance
however the extraction is general and do not require deep analysis of the language barzilay and mckeown pontes et al

pontes et al
use graph theory to create concomitant with js divergence multi document summaries by extraction
their system describes a text model as a graph where the sentences are represented by vertices two similar sentences
and the edges connect their approach calculates the stable set of the graph aiming creating the summary containing sentences with general information of the cluster linhares et al
and without redundancy
model the text as graph model and use a heuristic greedy algorithm to obtain the relevant sentences in the text
the speech summarization task is more complex and it involves other problems
it is more difcult to identify utterance boundaries because it may be fragmented contain disuencies and also because speech recognition introduces errors
meetings involve multi party conversation with overlapping speakers
the language used is tend to be partial informal and utterances fragmentary ungrammatical and include many the speech ellipses and pronouns
however signal may provides additional information that emphasizes a piece of text as prosody murray et al

mckeown et al
described some ways summarization as a speech to use a text summarization
they described some work about summarization of broadcast news and meetings
murray et al
analyzed extractive summarization of multiparty meetings
they described maximal marginal relevance and latent semantic analysis to create the summary based on prosodic and lexical features
modeling the problem sentences
documents extraction statistical this paper aims to design a system to summarize its most by several important techniques were used to build a language independent system
the proposed methods are based on a specic preprocessing of words a weighting function of sentences and a bag of words model to represent the text content
this model uses k matrices represented by sk mn and constructed from k documents where ma is the number of sentences and na is the number of distinct words in the document a a k
the cell ij of the matrix represents the frequency of word j in the sentence i f pij of the document a
this stage was constructed using the libraries and algorithms from cortex summarization system torres moreno et al

jensen shannon divergence we use jensen shannon js divergence to measure the similarity between sentences
let w be a words set in p and q
p and q represent the probability distribution between two objects two individuals sentences or a sentence and a set of sentences
the divergence will then calculated among these two objects
the js divergence is symmetric and provides a stable way to measure the difference between two distributions equation
pw log ww pw pw qw qw log qw pw qw the js divergence value ranges from
it is closer to zero when the distributions are similar and they differ in another case
in the case there is a word in a sentence that is missing in another one a smooth different weighting will be used to avoid null values and have a smoother distribution hiemstra
if a word w is not present in the sentence q then the smooth is calculated by the equation where
voc which voc is the number of distinct words in r is the variable that controls the relevance of the missing word in the sentence and n is the number of words in r louis and nenkova
qw pw n
term frequency inverse sentence frequency tf isf one way to verify the initial relevance of a word and a sentence to the text is through the tf isf
this metric is based on term frequency in the text and it is calculated by the equation
tf isf log n nw where tf w is frequency of term w n is total number of documents and nw is number of documents that contain the term w
the lia rag system in general lines a text consists of several sentences with different topics
the text can be divided into several groups and each of them describes one step idea in the text
if a group is large then it is relevant to the text
it is possible to choose the sentences of the largest group and obtains the most relevant content
the main ideas of a text are generally analyzed and discussed several times
the vertices with higher degree have more similar sentences and then are important to the text
however it is not necessary to have a lot of similar sentences to be a relevant one
resumeur audio texte a base graphes rag is a summarizer system by sentence extraction which selects the main sentences of a text and uses a post processing to remove some errors and make the text more concise and compact

the rag algorithm rag uses graph theory and divergence metrics to calculate the similarity and to group the sentences
initially the system performs a ltering process to remove the brackets
then it performs a segmentation ltering and stemming processes to remove stopwords and reduce the words to their roots
rag accomplished this preprocessing and matrix transformation based on torres moreno et al

it calculates the relevance of each sentence based on tf isf metric equation and removes the less relevant sentences
the system creates a graph g which each vertex represents a sentence previously selected
the text is analyzed and modeled as a sentence graph vertices
based on equation it calculates the similarity between sentences
if the similarity between two sentences is less than
threshold obtained by empirical testing then the system creates an edge between them
so the vertices with higher degrees have the most relevant content of the text
however some sentences may have a small degree but they may contain important information
rag combines the tf isf and degree sentences to analyze the relevance of them
the relevance of the sentence i is dened by tf isf i where is the degree of vertex i and is the relevance of the sentence i
after the system creates a summary with the higher score sentences excluding similar or redundant sentences based on dice s coefcient bai et al

the gure describes the rag system

lia rag rag with a specic speech post processing the speech recognition process produces a text that contains several grammatical problems slang colloquialisms expressions and speech figure architecture of the rag system
recognition errors
an extraction summary algorithm selects the relevant sentences however the sentences may have some grammatical problems
is necessary to perform a treatment of this summary
so it the main analyzed aspects in this process are colloquialisms speech expressions and dates
lia rag system receives the summary as an in this input some speech expressions input
ideas or concepts in are used to connect oral conversations
lia rag removes these expressions because often they are incorrectly transcripted a noise source
the system eliminates several colloquialisms and the duplicated words
the system replaces some mistaken words by its correct form
the gure shows the architecture of the lia rag system
also results the tests were carried on a computer with
ghz processor and gb of ram on gnu linux systems lia rag base rand

table evaluation of test corpus
conclusion and perspectives divergence of probabilities in a graph model to extract key sentences in french speech to text summarization was very interesting
lia rag resources system uses very few language stopwords and stemming and has achieved good results
nevertheless the system is easily adaptable to other languages with only some modications in the preprocessing stage
an interesting perspective of this work consists in the utilization of the speech tags markers to improve the computation of the sentences score
in addition it is necessary to improve the post processing in order to increase the quality of the nal summary
finally the verication of the grammaticality and readability of the extracted key sentences can help to produce more realistic abstracts
acknowledgments this project was partially founded by a scholarship from funcap ce brazil
figure architecture of the lia rag system
debian bit operating system
the algorithms of rag were implemented using the perl language
we used the french decoda corpus bechet et al

the systems have to generate textual summaries with the main idea of each conversation belonging to the corpus
the conversations topics range from itinerary and schedule requests to lost and found to complaints the calls were recorded during strikes favre et al

each summary has of the number of words of each conversation transcription
we compared lia rag and rag systems with two baseline systems random and rst lead base
to evaluate the quality of the summaries multiling cccs used the system recall oriented gisting understudy evaluation determines the quality of an automatic summary based on the a candidate summary and the n grams of a set of reference summaries
more specically we used rouge n and rouge su measures
rouge n n
rouge is an n gram recall measure lin
the values of these metrics belongs to for the best result
the n grams of intersection of in order which for the table shows the results obtained using the systems over the training corpus
this corpus contains conversations transcription with words and summaries
both versions of rag provided the best results
the rag system identied the main sentences discussed the errors and in conversations
speech expressions decreased the informativeness
the post processing of lia rag allowed to improve the results
this process reduces errors and generates a more informative and concise summary
however the french test corpus has conversations options for running rouge
