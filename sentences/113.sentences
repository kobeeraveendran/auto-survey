v i x r a a semantic relevance based neural network for text summarization and text simplication shuming ma peking university xu sun peking university text summarization and text simplication are two major ways to simplify the text for poor ers including children non native speakers and the functionally illiterate
text summarization is to produce a brief summary of the main ideas of the text while text simplication aims to reduce the linguistic complexity of the text and retain the original meaning
recently most approaches for text summarization and text simplication are based on the sequence to sequence model which achieves much success in many text generation tasks
however although the generated simplied texts are similar to source texts literally they have low semantic relevance
in this work our goal is to improve semantic relevance between source texts and simplied texts for text summarization and text simplication
we introduce a semantic relevance based neural model to encourage high semantic similarity between texts and summaries
in our model the source text is represented by a gated attention encoder while the summary representation is produced by a decoder
besides the similarity score between the representations is maximized during training
our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art systems on two benchmark

introduction text summarization and text simplication is to make the text easier to read and understand especially for poor readers including children non native speakers and the functionally erate
text summarization is to simplify the texts at the document level
the source texts are often consist of many sentences or paragraphs and the simplied texts are some brief sentences of the main ideas of the source texts
text simplication is to simplify the texts at the sentence level
it aims to simplify the sentences to reduce the lexical and structure complexity
unlike text summarization it does not require the simplied sentences are shorter but requires the words are simple to understand
in some previous work extractive summarization achieves satisfying performance by lecting a few sentences from source texts radev et al
cheng and lapata cao et al

by extracting the sentences the generated texts are grammatical and retain the same meaning with the source texts
however it does not simplify the texts but only shorten the texts
some previous related work regards text simplication as a combination of three operations splitting deletion and paraphrasing which requires some rule based models or heavy tic features zhu bernhard and gurevych woodsend and lapata filippova et al

sequence to sequence model is a widely used end to end framework for text generation such as machine translation
it compresses the source text information into dense vectors with the neural encoder and the neural decoder generates the target text using the compressed vectors
for text and text for both text summarization and text simplication the simplied texts must have high semantic relevance to the source texts
however current sequence to sequence models tend to produce grammatical and coherent simplied texts regardless of the semantic relevance to source texts
table shows that the summary generated by a lstm sequence to sequence model is similar to the source text literally but it has low semantic relevance
in this work our goal is to improve the semantic relevance between source texts and generated simplied texts for text summarization and text simplication
to achieve this goal we propose a semantic relevance based neural network model srb
in our model we compress the source texts into dense vectors with the encoder and decode the dense vector into simplied texts with the decoder
the encoder produces the representation of source texts and the decoder produces the representation of the generated texts
a similarity evaluation component is introduced to measure the relevance of source texts and generated texts
during training it maximizes the similarity score to encourage high semantic relevance between source texts and simplied texts
in order to better represent a long source text we introduce a self gated attention encoder to memory the input text
we conduct the experiments on three corpus namely lcsts pwkp and ew sew
experiments show that our proposed model has better performance than the state of the art systems on two benchmark corpus
the contributions of this work are as follow we propose a semantic relevance based neural network model srb to improve the semantic relevance between source texts and generated simplied texts for text summarization and text simplication
a similarity evaluation component is shuming ma et al
a semantic relevance based neural network for summarization and simplication introduced to measure the relevance of source texts and generated texts and the similarity score is maximized to encourage high semantic relevance between source texts and simplied texts
we introduce a self gated encoder to better represent a long redundant text
we perform the experiments on three corpus namely lcsts pwkp and ew sew
experiments show that our proposed model outperforms the state of the art systems on two benchmark corpus

background sequence to sequence model most recent models for text summarization and text simplication are based on the to sequence model
the sequence to sequence model is able to compress source texts


xn into a continuous vector representation with an encoder and then generates the simplied text y


ym with a decoder
in the previous work nisioi et al
hu chen and zhu the encoder is a two layer long short term memory network lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber which maps source texts into the hidden vector


hn
the decoder is a uni directional lstm producing the hidden output st which is the dense representation of the words at the tth time step
finally the word generator computes the distribution of output words yt with the hidden state st and the parameter matrix w attention mechanism is introduced to better capture context information of source texts bahdanau cho and bengio
attention vector ct is calculated by the weighted sum of encoder hidden states where hi is an attentive score between the decoder hidden state st and the encoder hidden state hi
when predicting an output word the decoder takes account of the attention vector which contains the alignment information between source texts and simplied texts
with the attention mechanism the word generator computes the distribution of output words yt sof st ct tihi n x ti hi n hj p sof computational linguistics volume number admission is very hard cos attention admission is extremely competitive figure our semantic relevance based neural model
it consists of decoder above encoder below and cosine similarity function

proposed model our goal is to improve the semantic relevance between source texts and simplied texts so our proposed model encourages high similarity between their representations
figure shows our proposed model
the model consists of three components encoder decoder and a similarity function
the encoder compresses source texts into semantic vectors and the decoder generates summaries and produces semantic vectors of the generated summaries
finally the similarity function evaluates the relevance between the sematic vectors of source texts and generated summaries
our training objective is to maximize the similarity score so that the generated summaries have high semantic relevance to source texts

self gated encoder the goal of the complex text encoder is to provide a series of dense representation of source texts for the decoder and the semantic relevance component
in the previous work nisioi et al
the complex text encoder is a two layer uni directional long short term memory work lstm which produces the dense representation


hn from the source text


xn
however in text summarization and text simplication source texts are usually very long and noisy
therefore some encoding information in the beginning of the texts will vanish until the end of the texts which leads to bad representations of the texts
bi directional lstm is an alternative to deal with the problem but it needs double time to encoder the source texts and it does not represents the middle of the texts well when the texts are too long
to solve the problem we propose a self gated encoder to better represent a long text
in text summarization and text simplication some words or information in the source texts are unimportant so they need to be simplied or discarded
therefore we introduce a self gated shuming ma et al
a semantic relevance based neural network for summarization and simplication self gated layer admission is extremely competitive figure the self gated encoder
it measure the importance of each word and decide how much information is reserved as the representation of the texts
encoder which can reduce the unnecessary information and enhance the important information to represent a long text
self gated encoder try to measure the importance of each word and decide how much information is reserved as the representation of the texts
at each time step every upcoming word xt is fed into the lstm cell which outputs the dense vector ht where f is the lstm function and ht is the output vector of the lstm cell
a feed forward neural network is used to measure the importance and decide how much information is reversed where g is the feed forward neural network function and t measures the proportion of the reserved information
finally the reversed information is computed by multiplying t ht xt t ht tht where ht is the representation at the tth time step and is the input embedding of at the t time step

simplied text decoder the goal of the simplied text decoder is to generate a series of simplied words from the dense representation of source texts
in our model the dense representations of the source texts are fed computational linguistics volume number into an attention layer to generate the context vector ct ct tihi n x ti n p sof st st yt vt vs vt kvskkvtk where st is the dense representation of generated simplied computed by a two layer lstm
in this way ct and st respectively represent the context information of source texts and the target texts at the tth time step
to predict the tth word the decoder uses ct and st to generate the probability distribution of the candidate words where w and wc are the parameter matrix of the output layer
finally the word with the highest probability is predicted
semantic relevance our goal is to compute the semantic relevance of source texts and generated texts given the source semantic vector vt and the generated sementic vector vs
here we use cosine similarity to measure the semantic relevance which is represented with a dot product and magnitude source texts and generated texts share the same language so it is reasonable to assume that their semantic vectors are distributed in the same space
cosine similarity is a good way to measure the distance between two vectors in the same space
with the semantic relevance metric the problem is how to get the semantic vector vs and vt
there are several methods to represent a text or a sentence such as mean pooling of lstm output or reserving the last state of lstm
in our model we select the last state of the encoder as the representation of source texts vs a natural idea to get the semantic vector of a summary is to feed it into the encoder as well
however this method wastes much time because we encode the same sentence twice
actually the last output of the decoder sm contains information of both source text and generated shuming ma et al
a semantic relevance based neural network for summarization and simplication summaries
we simply compute the semantic vector of the summary by subtracting hn from sm vs sm hn previous work has proved that it is effective to represent a span of words without encoding them once more wang and chang

training given the model parameter and input text the model produces corresponding summary y and semantic vector vs and vt
the objective is to minimize the loss function l vt where is the conditional probability of summaries given source texts and is computed by the encoder decoder model
vt is cosine similarity of semantic vectors vs and vt
this term tries to maximize the semantic relevance between source input and target output
we use adam optimization method to train the model with the default hyper parameters the learning rate
and


in this section we present the evaluation of our model and show its performance on three popular corpus
besides we perform a case study to explain the semantic relevance between generated summary and source text

experiments
datasets we introduce a chinese text summarization dataset and two popular text simplication datasets
the simplication datasets are both from the alignments between english wikipedia and simple english wikipedia
the simple english wikipedia is built for the children and adults who are learning the english language and the articles are composed with easy words and short sentences
therefore simple english wikipedia is a natural public simplied text corpus
most of the text simplication benchmark datasets are constructed from simple english wikipedia
large scale chinese short text summarization dataset lcsts
lcsts is constructed by hu chen and zhu
the dataset consists of more than
million text summary pairs constructed from a famous chinese social media website called sina
it is split into three parts with pairs in part i pairs in part ii and pairs in part iii
all the text summary pairs in part ii and part iii are manually annotated with relevant scores ranged from to and we only reserve pairs with scores no less than
following the previous work we use part i as training set part ii as development set and part iii as test set
parallel pwkp
pwkp zhu bernhard and gurevych is a widely used benchmark for evaluating text simplication systems
it consists of aligned complex text from english wikipedia as of simplication wikipedia corpus
wikipedia
org
wikipedia
org weibo
sina
com computational linguistics volume number aug
and simple text from simple wikipedia as of aug

the dataset contains sentence pairs with
words on average per complex sentence and
words per simple sentence
following the previous work zhang and lapata we remove the duplicate sentence pairs and split the corpus with pairs for training pairs for development and pairs for test
english wikipedia and simple english wikipedia ew sew
ew sew is a publicly available dataset provided by hwang et al

to build the corpus they rst align the complex simple sentence pairs score the semantic similarity between the complex sentence and the simple sentence and classify each sentence pair as a good good partial partial or bad match
following the previous work nisioi et al
we discard the unclassied matches and use the good matches and partial matches with a scaled threshold greater than

the corpus contains about k good matches and k good partial matches
we use this corpus as the training set and the dataset provided by xu et al
xu et al
as the development set and the test set
the development set consists of sentence pairs and the test set contains sentence pairs
besides each complex sentence is paired with reference simplied sentences provided by amazon mechanical turk workers

settings we describe the experimental details of text summarization and text simplication respectively
text summarization
to alleviate the risk of word segmentation mistakes xu and sun sun wang and li we use chinese character sequences as both source inputs and target outputs
we limit the model vocabulary size to which covers most of the common characters
each character is represented by a random initialized word embedding
we tune our parameter on the development set
in our model the embedding size is the hidden state size of encoder decoder is and the size of gated attention network is
we use adam optimizer to learn the model parameters and the batch size is set as
the parameter is

both the encoder and decoder are based on lstm unit
following the ous work hu chen and zhu our evaluation metric is f score of rouge and rouge l lin and hovy
text simplication
the text simplication datasets contain a lot of named entities which makes the vocabulary too large
to reduce the vocabulary size we follow the setting by zhang and lapata
we recognize the named entities with the stanford corenlp ger manning et al
and replace the named entities with the anonymous symbols where loc org misc where n represents the n th entity in the sentence
to limit the vocabulary size we prune the vocabulary to top most frequent words and replace the rest words with the unk symbols
at test time we replace the unk symbols with the highest probability score from the attention alignment matrix following jean et al
jean et al

we lter out sentence pairs whose lengths exceed words in the training set
the encoder is implemented on lstm and the decoder is based on lstm with luong style attention luong pham and manning
we tune our hyper parameter on the development set
the model has two lstm layers
the hidden size of lstm is and the embedding size is
we use adam optimizer kingma and ba to learn the parameters and the batch size is set to be
we set the dropout rate srivastava et al
to be

all of the gradients are clipped when the norm exceeds
the evaluation metric is bleu score

it concludes that srb produces summaries with higher semantic similarity to texts

nts omits so many words that it lacks a lot of information
pbmt r generates some evant words like siemens martin and which hurts the uency and adequacy of the generated sentence
