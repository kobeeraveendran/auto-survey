com abstract current summarization systems yield generic summaries that are disconnected from users preferences and expectations
to address this limitation we present ctrlsum a novel framework for controllable summarization
our approach enables users to control multiple aspects of generated summaries by interacting with the summarization system through textual input in the form of a set of words or descriptive prompts
using a single unied model ctrlsum is able to achieve a broad scope of summary manipulation at inference time without ing additional human annotations or pre dening a set of control aspects during training
we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains of summarization datasets and ve control aspects entity centric and length controllable summarization contribution summarization on scientic pers invention purpose summarization on patent lings and question guided summarization on news articles in a reading comprehension setting
moreover when used in a standard uncontrolled summarization setting ctrlsum achieves state of the art results on the cnn dailymail dataset
introduction neural summarization systems aim to compress a document into a short paragraph or sentence while preserving key information
there are largely two categories of summarization systems extractive summarization that extracts important portions of a document cheng lapata nallapati et al
narayan et al
and abstractive summarization that freely generates novel sentences rush et al
see et al
paulus et al
which can produce coherent and uent summaries more exibly
in this paper we focus on abstractive summarization
typically abstractive summarization methods take a document as input and yield a generic summary to cover certain information identied by the model
however content of interest is user dependent
summaries should select information with respect to preferences of a user
for example figure shows an nba basketball news article and the reference summary describes several match results
however fans of certain basketball stars in these teams such as lebron james or stephen curry might only be interested in the matches they played and would like to know the player s scores as well
motivated by this we focus on controllable summarization which allows the users to manipulate the summaries from the model
we propose ctrlsum a framework to control summaries through control tokens in the form of a set of keywords or descriptive prompts
at training time the model learns to predict summaries conditioned on both the source document and keywords that serve as external guidance
during inference keywords and optional prompts which are the target prex to constrain decoding are combined as control tokens to convey user preferences as shown in figure
work done during internship at salesforce research and model checkpoints are available at
com salesforce ctrl sum
figure workow of the ctrlsum framework at inference time
users interact with summaries through textual control tokens in the form of keywords or prompts
keywords are required as input during training and testing while prompts are optionally used at test time
dashed lines represent optional paths control tokens can come from the source article user or both
the right portion of the gure shows actual outputs from ctrlsum
keywords and prompts are complementary
prompts do not perform well in many cases such as entity or length controlled summarization as our preliminary experiments imply but keywords can achieve those goals in a exible way for example by using entity as keywords or varying the number of keywords to control entities and length respectively
however keywords struggle in more open ended scenarios like summarizing a list of contributions of scientic papers while constraining the coding with prompt the main contributions of this paper is possibly sufcient to achieve the goal
ctrlsum is trained using only keywords as additional input which can be easily identied from training summaries
it requires neither extra human annotations nor pre dening control aspects for training yet is quite exible to achieve a broad scope of text manipulation as we will show in this paper
in contrast prior work primarily rely on pre dened control codes fan et al
liu et al
keskar et al
thus need to collect annotations for training and can not generalize to unseen control aspects easily at test time
we use pretrained bart lewis et al
as the underlying architecture and perform experiments on three datasets in three distinct domains cnn dailymail news articles hermann et al
arxiv scientic papers cohan et al
and bigpatent patent documents sharma et al

we quantitatively evaluate ctrlsum on ve control aspects entity centric
and length controllable summarization
summarizing the contributions of scientic papers summarizing the purpose of an invention
and summarizing answers to given questions in a zero shot reading comprehension setting

notably our approach also achieves comparable or superior performance to the strong bart summarization model on all datasets in a standard uncontrolled setting
leading to state of the art results on the cnn dailymail dataset
ctrlsum
overview unconstrained neural summarization methods are trained to learn the conditional distribution where and y represent the source document and summary respectively
the generated summaries depend solely on the document without human involvement
to control the output summaries we propose using additional control tokens to represent user preferences and training a summarization model that predicts the conditional distribution
the control tokens include keywords as extra inputs during training and inference
they can also optionally include prompts at test time to further constrain the decoding process
as shown in figure control tokens in the form of keywords prompts or a combination of both act as an interface between users and an otherwise black box neural model providing a exible way for users dwyane wade scored of his points in the first half and goran dragic added as the miami heat handed lebron james another loss on his former home floor with a victory over the cleveland cavaliers on monday ignoring tokens james scored of his points in the fourth quarter for cleveland which had its four game winning streak snapped

keywords q how many scores did stephen curry get a prompt q how many scores did stephen curry get a
to explicitly control automatic summarization
next we describe how to obtain automatic keywords for training as well as potential applications at test time

automatic keyword extraction in addition to extracting keywords from training data to train the model ctrlsum also features an automatic keywords extraction mechanism at test time which can be used to suggest automatic keywords according to user preferences or perform uncontrolled summarization without user signals
next we describe the keywords extraction methods at training and inference time respectively
training
for training we use the ground truth summary to identify keywords in the source document
specically we rst greedily select sentences from the document that maximize the rouge scores lin with the reference summary
this step constrains keywords to those found in important sentences
then we identify all the longest sub sequences in the extracted sentences that have matched sub sequences in the ground truth summary similar to the copying word recognition method in gehrmann et al

finally we remove duplicate words and stop words and keep the remaining tokens as keywords
compared to other keywords extraction methods riloff lehnert mihalcea tarau which output only a few salient words our extraction retains most content words found in the summary
this encourages dependence on the given keywords by building a reliable correlation between their presence in the input and the target
it in turn ensures that user provided keywords are not ignored by the model at test time which is catastrophic for a controllable summarization system
inference
we formulate the keyword extraction problem at test time as a sequence labeling task
concretely we train a bert based sequence tagger devlin et al
on the keywords and documents from training dataset
this tagger then computes the selection probability qj for each token in the test document
similar to training time extraction we rst select ns sentences with the highest average token selection probability
within these sentences words with qj are selected as keywords up to a maximum number of mmax
the three hyperparameters ns mmax are selected based on the uncontrolled summarization performance on validation datasets
the results are reasonably robust to different settings see appendix d for details

summarization training details format
at training time we prepend the keyword sequence to the source document separated with a special token
the summarization model is then trained to maximize in an end to end fashion
the keyword sequence maintains the order of the keywords as they were in the source document but we observe that the model often ignores this ordering as it frequently differs between source and target summary
we also separate keywords from different source sentences with the special token
in applications where the sentence boundary is unknown as when users propose their own keywords the token can be ignored as in some of our experiments
keyword dropout
as mentioned in
our keyword extraction strategy retains most words from the summary found in the source document
without regularization the dependence on such keywords is strong enough that the model rarely generates novel words in the summary
to remedy this we randomly drop keywords at training time so that the model learns to rely on keywords that are present in the input while also learning to still carry over key information from the source document that is not present in the keywords
note that keywords dropout is applied at training time only
next we are going to introduce the ve control aspects that we study in this paper as example use cases of ctrlsum
qualitative examples of them are shown in table

summarization inference with keywords
the keywords provide a generic interface to control multiple aspects of summaries which allows the user to optionally rely on automatically extracted keywords user provided keywords or a combination of both
this method provides clean separation of test time user control and the training process including pretraining
consequently ctrlsum can be adapted to new use cases without changing model parameters
for example though nothing during training specically focuses on controlling table qualitative examples from the output of ctrlsum
left column shows source or the generic reference summary
keywords are bolded
that the tokens are used as both keywords and prompts

the reinforcements come four days after isis began attacking northern iraq s baiji oil renery a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility renes much of the fuel used by iraqis domestically
the additional troops came from camp speicher a fortied iraqi base near the city of tikrit according to the media ofce of the hasd shaabi militia
the reinforcements include two federal police regiments an iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from hasd al shaabi
ignoring tokens the renery is kilometers miles from tikrit
reference multiple sclerosis is a degenerative condition of the central nervous system that affects nearly
lion of individuals in terms of their ignoring tokens
in this work we resort to regularized machine learning methods for binary classication and multiple output gression we propose a pipeline that can be used to predict the disease progression from patient reported measures
the obtained model is tested on a data set collected from an ongoing clinical research project

the sealed geometric shape has a rst light permitting surface and a second exible surface

contribution the main contributions of this paper are we propose a regularization based data analysis pipeline for the prediction of the transition point between relapsing remitting and secondary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis we test the performance of the proposed pipeline on a data set collected from patients currently enrolled in an ongoing funded project we discuss the potential role of patient reported outcome measures proms in the study of the disease evolution
purpose the purpose of the present invention is to provide an intraocular pressure measuring system that is small enough to be implanted in the eye of a patient entities or length examples below demonstrate the general applicability of keyword control to entity and length manipulation
entity control
the goal of entity control is to produce summaries that focus on entities of interest
figure exemplies summarization with respect to different players when those player names are included as keywords directly inuencing the summary
length control
users may have different preferences as to the length of summaries
we allow such manipulation of the summary length through a user specied length parameter
specically we rst separate the training data into buckets by summary length so that each bucket has the same number of examples
then we compute the average number of keywords kl for each bucket on the training data
at test time a user can specify length parameter l to include the kl keywords with the highest selection probability computed by the sequence tagger
this is similar to saito et al
which uses the number of guiding words to control summary length

summarization inference with keywords and prompts prompts are pre dened text sequences used as the target prex to constrain decoding
they have been utilized to perform multi purpose text generation with a single unied model radford et al
brown et al

in the ctrlsum framework prompts are a kind of control token sequence and we always use such tokens as both the target prex and keywords ablation results on using prompts as keywords or prex alone can be found in appendix c
we nd that using prompts as keywords besides prex helps focus on prompt related content and mitigate the over generation issue of vanilla summarization models as we will show in

to the best of our knowledge we are the rst to evaluate such a prompt based control method for summarization systems
summarizing contributions
existing datasets about scientic papers such as arxiv cohan et al
collect paper abstracts as the summaries which often include extra background context and lack detailed contribution descriptions for the associated paper
in many cases readers would benet from an explicit list of contributions in order to understand the novelty and value of the paper
for these cases we propose using control tokens the main contributions of this paper
this prompt then triggers generation of a summary focused on contributions
summarizing invention purpose
patent article summaries in existing datasets such as patent sharma et al
can be over complicated often covering core method details
yet for a non technical reader it would be preferred to provide a one sentence summary that states the purpose of the invention while ignoring technical details
to apply ctrlsum in this scenario we use the control tokens the purpose of the present invention is
this triggers a concise summary focused on patent purpose
question guided summarization
human summarization can be constrained by questions cinski et al
that require answers to be found in the summary
this points to an important connection between summarization and reading comprehension that we further explore
we esize that a summarization model can directly answer some questions about the article if guided properly
this suggests the possibility of subsuming reading comprehension as a form of tion
to verify this hypothesis we use the control tokens q question text a to trigger reading comprehension behaviour
we note that and keywords based control are complementary in practice while prompts could theoretically achieve any type of control empirically they often do not work well for many aspects and the model is very sensitive to the precise wording of the prompt
for example we found that using prompts such as a summary focused on entity is or a short summary is does not work as well as explicitly using keywords for entity or length control details can be found in appendix c
related work previous work on controllable summarization often collects control codes such as entity or length as supervision to train the model conditioned on both the code and article together fan et al
liu et al

these methods do not generalize for controlling aspects of the summarization that were not seen during training
recently saito et al
use the number of word prototypes to control summary length in a similar way to how we use keywords
interactive summarization provides a way for users to continuously control the information that is included in the summary bornstein et al
leuski et al

more broadly controllable text generation has been studied for styles hu et al
fu et al
he et al
topics tang et al
huang et al
and templates guu et al
wiseman et al
he et al

keyword guided text generation has been applied in other contexts with different motivations
gehrmann et al
utilize copying words at test time to mask copying operations in a marization task
li et al
and saito et al
use keywords as extra input to improve the uncontrolled summarization performance
wang et al
mou et al
and yao et al
use textual input to plan poetry dialogue and stories respectively

brown et al

experiments our experiments below are designed to test the control efcacy of ctrlsum on ve different aspects and examine the performance of ctrlsum in a traditional summarization setting without external control signals
also extensive model output examples can be found in appendix e

experimental details we perform experiments on three distinct domain summarization datasets cnn dailymail ndm news articles hermann et al

and bigpatent patent articles sharma et al

cated to tokens and the target summaries are truncated to tokens following zhang et al

the conditional distribution in ctrlsum is our ne tuned version of the pretrained bartlarge model lewis et al
which achieves state of the art performance on several summarization benchmarks
the automatic keyword tagger at test time is based on the pretrained bertlarge model devlin et al
ne tuned as described in

our summarization model implementation is based on the fairseq toolkit ott et al
and the automatic keyword extraction model is based on the huggingface transformers library wolf et al

complete setup and training details can be found in appendix a

for evaluation we measure commonly used rouge scores lin and the recently proposed bertscore zhang et al
when ground truth is available
for control related evaluation where we often do not have reference summaries we collect ground truth summaries when possible examine whether summaries respect the control signal or resort to human evaluation

entity control setup
we rst simulate user preference by providing the model with oracle entities extracted from the ground truth target
then we compare it to the model using automatic keywords in a uncontrolled setting to show the effect of oracle entities
to examine whether the decoded summaries respect entity change we sample documents and repeatedly acquire every entity in the document to generate summaries following fan et al

then we compute success rate the fraction of requested entity actually occurring in the output summaries
the results are reported in separation of whether the entity is from leading sentences or from the full article
to test if the summaries from different entity input are factually consistent with the document we sample another documents and for each we randomly sample one important entity that appears in the reference and one unimportant entity that occurs neither in the reference nor the leading three source sentences to produce summaries
for each article summary pair we ask annotators from amazon mechanical turk to make a binary decision as to whether the summary can be entailed from the article
we then take the majority vote as the result and report the fraction of factually correct summaries
we evaluate on cnndm only since many examples in arxiv and bigpatent do not have identiable entities
results
in table we observe that the use of oracle entities helps boost the score by
points compared with using automatic keywords which means ctrlsum is able to take advantage of the given entities
table shows the success rate and factual correctness evaluations
we include the numbers from fan et al
entitycode for reference point
we note that their numbers come table length control performance
mad measures the deviation of output length from reference length while pcc represents the correlation between given length signal and the actual output length

from a convolutional architecture see appendix b for ablation analysis on this and their method utilizes entity annotations during training time thus is not very comparable to ctrlsum
remarkably our model achieves a high success rate for both and full article entities reaching around
yet other systems struggle to include the given entities especially for the ones that do not occur in the beginning of the article
factual correctness scores from human annotators suggest that ctrlsum is able to generate factually consistent summaries no matter whether the entity of interest is important or not comparable to the unconstrained bart baseline

length control setup
similar to entity control we rst examine the effect of oracle length signal from the reference to simulate user preference
in addition to rouge and bertscore we measure the length distance between the decoded summary and the reference following liu et al

specically we compute the mean of absolute deviation mad of the actual length bucket code lsys of the decoded summary from the ground truth control code lref as ref
to assess the summary n variations as length signals change we further sample documents and decode different length summaries for each document
then we report the pearson correlation coefcient pcc between the input bucket code and actual bucket code
experiments are conducted on cnndm and arxiv
sys n results
in table ctrlsum with oracle length signals only presents relatively small gains over the automatic ctrlsum baseline
this implies that oracle lengths only convey limited additional information to help generate the reference summary
we also run the lengthcode baseline fan et al
based on bart where the ground truth length bucket code is prepended to the article at both training at test time
however lengthcode fails to consistently improve over bart with oracle length signals
moreover we nd that the bart model ne tuned with lengthcode method almost ignores the length signal with pcc close to as shown in table
this is not very surprising since length code would be less useful when the summarizers grow stronger which can already learn a good length predictor implicitly
in contrast ctrlsum with length guided keywords achieves high positive pcc between control signal and actual output length and is able to reduce the length deviation mad compared to automatic baselines

contribution and purpose summarization contribution summarization setup
there is no existing dataset to evaluate contribution marization of scientic papers bringing challenges to our evaluation
however researchers often summarize the bullet contributions of their paper in the introduction section which inspire us to extract such contribution claims as the reference summary
therefore we resort to the entire arxiv and download all the papers whose rst submission time is within the rst six months of that gives us k papers
we extract the introduction section and bullet contributions with regular expression and lter out the ones that fail
the contributions are used as the reference and the introduction section after removing the contribution claims is used as the source article we aim do not use the arxiv test set because we can only extract valid test points from it
the entire arxiv database is at
kaggle
com cornell university arxiv arxiv dataset used to train ctrlsum is collected before april according to their paper submission time thus there should be no data overlap between the training data and our contribution test data
table summarization performance on contributions of papers and purpose of inventions
the bart baseline uses prompts while ctrlsum use the same trigger as both keywords and prompts
model contribution patent purpose l bertscore p r l bertscore p r bart prompt ctrlsum























to predict contributions from the rest of the introduction section
this procedure leads to test examples
we test the model trained on arxiv
purpose summarization setup
to collect a test dataset that features one sentence invention purpose summaries we sample test examples from bigpatent and present their reference summaries to human annotators from amazon mechanical turk
for each example we ask one annotator to select the sentence that convey the purpose of the invention
we also provide the option for annotators that the invention purpose can not be identied
after ltering out the invalid examples we collect examples as our test data
results
table shows results of contribution summarization on scientic papers and invention purpose summarization on patent lings
through using the prompt text as both the decoder and keywords ctrlsum outperforms the bart baseline in most cases
we further report the precision p and recall r scores in bertscore besides
we observe that the bart baseline tends to over generate a full summary with low precision scores while ctrlsum is able to focus on keywords related content

question guided summarization setup
we directly test question guided summarization on reading comprehension benchmarks in a zero shot setting
specically we evaluate the cnndm summarization models on in domain newsqa trischler et al
and out of domain squad
rajpurkar et al
respectively
we note that some newsqa test articles are present in the cnndm summarization training dataset yet we think it is still a reasonable unsupervised setting since our model never sees questions or answers during training
in addition to comparing with the vanilla bart model we also include the zero shot performance from language models radford et al
without ne tuning as a reference point
we omit the largest model with
parameters since it can not be evaluated in our single gpu device due to memory limits
we report scores on the two benchmarks
results
bart is pretrained with a denoising task to predict the denoised version of the source and performs poorly on zero shot reading comprehension out of box as shown in table
interestingly however bart ne tuned on a summarization task without seeing any question answer pairs in the training data is able to improve the scores by
and
points on newsqa and squad respectively
moreover ctrlsum equipped with question keywords is able to further boost the performance by
and
points approaching the supervised matchlstm wang jiang score on newsqa
such results suggest that summarization might be a suitable transfer task for abstractive reading comprehension which we leave for future work to explore

automatic summarization table shows the uncontrolled summarization performance without any user input where our method uses the automatically extracted keywords as described in

on cnndm and arxiv datasets ctrlsum outperforms the strong bart and pegasus baselines by a large margin leading to new state of the art performance on cnndm
it also performs comparably to the bart baseline on bigpatent in terms of bertscore though with an inferior score
yet there is a big performance gap between bart based models and pegasus on bigpatent
the reasons might be different dataset sub optimal learning schedule or inherent difference between bart and pegasus

human evaluation in this section we present human evaluation results for both controlled and uncontrolled tion
full experiment details can be found in appendix a

controlled summarization
we present further human evaluation results to evaluate control directly by informing annotators the intended control signal
we conduct experiments on entity and purpose control
specically we inform the annotators our intent to obtain summaries focused on a specic entity or purpose of patent then we ask them to provide scores in scale over two dimensions control accuracy ca whether the summary contains accurate main information with respect to the intent and control relevance cr how the summary is relevant to the control intent overall a summary that contains redundant contents that are unrelated to the intent will be penalized
results including signicance tests are shown in table
the control accuracy for important entity control and purpose control are comparable between bart and ctrlsum without signicant difference p value
while ctrlsum shows signicantly better control relevance overall by focusing on the desired information
also the unconstrained bart are unable to generate unimportant entity related summaries and thus suffers from poor scores on both dimensions
uncontrolled summarization
we follow grusky et al
fabbri et al
to ask human annotators from amazon mechanical turk to score summaries scale over four dimensions factual consistency fac the summary should only contain statements that can be entailed by the source document relevance rel the summary should only contain important information of the source document fluency flu each sentence in the summary should be uent and coherence coh the summary should be well structured and well organized
results including signicance tests are present in table
the quality of summaries from all systems on all dimensions is generally good with a score mostly higher than

however most scores do not show signicant difference from ctrlsum automatic keyword with large p values despite their very different similarities against the reference summaries in terms of rouge bertscore e

ctrlsum with oracle keywords
this implies that the summary quality from different systems powered by strong pretrained models like bart has become difcult to be clearly distinguished by non expert mturkers
updated the bigpatent data to preserve casing and applied some format cleaning
we also note that non expert human judgement for summarization may be unreliable and exhibit poor correlation with expert judgement gillick liu fabbri et al

in this paper we propose a generic framework to perform multi aspect controllable summarization
the model is conditioned on keywords to predict summaries during training
at inference time the control tokens in the form of keywords or prompts enable users to interact with models in a very exible way
experiments on ve different control aspects demonstrate the efcacy of our method

bertscore evaluating text generation with bert
in proceedings of iclr
a experimental setup details a
general setup in this section we include additional experimental details left out in the main content due to space limitations
we ne tune the pretrained bartlarge model in all our experiments
specically we use the bart
large checkpoint from fairseq ott et al

for all bart based summarization models we ne tune with learning rate and a polynomial learning rate decay schedule the optimizer is adam kingma ba and batch size is
our optimization scheme and rameters follow the bart ne tuning instructions in fairseq examples
we train the summarization models with steps on cnndm steps on arxiv and steps on bigpatent
we train the bert tagger with learning rate adam optimizer and batch size of on all datasets
similar to summarization models the tagger is trained with and steps on cnndm arxiv and bigpatent respectively
also we adopt a sliding window approach so that the bert based tagger is able to handle sequences that are longer than tokens
for both rouge and bertscore evaluation we report the measure
we report the rescaled bertscore and the hash code is roberta




as mentioned in
we need three hyperparameters for automatic keywords extraction during inference the number of pre selected sentences ns the selection probability threshold and the maximum number of keywords mmax
we select these hyperparameters for each dataset based on the uncontrolled summarization score on validation dataset
the summarization performance is robust to these hyperparameters in a reasonable range as shown in appendix d
specically we use ns
mmax for cnndm ns
mmax for arxiv and ns
mmax
invention purpose summarization
in the experiment of summarizing invention purpose on patent articles

we examined whether the model would possibly copy source sentences through matching the prompts we search strings in the form of the purpose of some words or phrases is among test examples and only test articles are identied
this means the models are not generating by exactly matching prompts most of the time
a
human evaluation setup here we include details about human evaluation experiments in

controlled summarization
for controlled summarization we sample examples for each task and summaries of each example from all systems are presented together to the human annotator to be scored
for cnndm we provide article and summaries while for bigpatent we provide reference and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article
this is because the source patent documents are very long and hard to be read by non expert humans
we did not evaluate contribution summarization since it is unrealistic to ask humans to judge contributions of many scientic papers from various domains
we tried to hire workers from amazon mechanical turk rst but we failed to obtain reliable results from them they often ignored the given user intent and tended to score the text as uncontrolled summaries reected by very poor scores on unimportant entity summaries because these summaries do not contain the main information of the article even though we instructed them that the control signal is critical
therefore we ask two independent human annotators through personal correspondence from the authors of this paper
one of the annotator is a phd researcher on physics and the other is a law graduate on intellectual property in the united states
they are able to follow the given control intent and considered more reliable than the mturkers
we take the average of two annotators as the score for each example and average over all examples to obtain the nal score
uncontrolled summarization
for uncontrolled summarization we sample examples for each dataset and hire independent workers from amazon mechanical turk to conduct evaluation
for cnndm we provide article and summaries while for arxiv and bigpatent we provide reference and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article
this is because the source patent documents or scientic papers are very long and hard to be read by non expert humans
summaries of each example from all systems are presented together to the human annotator to be scored
the median score of workers is taken for each example and average over all examples is reported
b ablation analysis of entity control in table we observe that ctrlsum achieves a very high success rate of entity control compared to previous work fan et al
which can only succeed
and
of the time on and full article entities respectively
we perform ablation analysis to understand the important gradients that contribute to the success of ctrlsum
we train ctrlsum with another two architectures in addition to bart convolutional gehring et al
with the same hyperparameters as in fan et al
and transformer with the same hyperparameters as the base model in vaswani et al

note that the transformer model is trained from scratch without pretraining
results are shown in table
ctrlsum parameterized with a weaker convolutional architecture fails to depend on the keywords well with an over point success rate drop yet the success rate of transformer without pretraining only drops around points
this implies that the transformer architecture is critical for ctrlsum to depend on the keywords well while pretraining can further improves it
table entity control results on cnndm
success rate is the fraction of decoded summaries that actually mention the given entity
model success rate full article bart lewis et al
fan et al
ctrlsum conv ctrlsum transformer ctrlsum bart









c ablation analysis on keywords and prompts in the controlling aspects we studied ctrlsum uses control tokens either as keywords alone entity and length or as keywords and prompts together contribution purpose qa
here we present further results when control tokens are used as prompts keywords or both for entity control contribution control and newsqa tasks
specically for entity control we use the control tokens a summary focused on entity is for prompt and prompt keyword variants
in this case success rate is computed excluding the prompt text
the control tokens for other settings are the same as previous experiments
results are shown in table where keywords and prompts are of different importance for different tasks and are complementary in general
for example using prompts to control entities turns out to be difcult with a very low success rate we nd that the system fails to understand the prompt and produce summaries appropriately in most cases
however prompts contribute the most to contribution summarization with comparable performance with using prompts and keywords together while removing prompts and using keywords alone suffers from drastic performance drop to trigger the contribution
for newsqa task prompts and keywords demonstrate mixing effectiveness using either of them alone experiences over points loss compared to using them together
reference points the l scores with automatic keywords of ctrlsum conv is


while ctrlsum transformer obtained



tried several prompts variants for example qa style ones q what happened to entity a
none of them lead to meaningful entity a or q what do we know about entity control
table ablation analysis on the role of keyword and prompt respectively
entity success rate refers to the full article entity success rate

d robustness analysis of keywords extraction hyperparameters table shows the scores of uncontrolled summarization on the validation set with different keywords extraction hyperparameters
we use more ne grained stride size to iterate the mmax hyperparameter for cnndm since its source articles are usually shorter than arxiv and bigpatent
as observed the automatic summarization performance is relatively robust to these hyperparameters in a reasonable range

the decision was part of an american civil liberties union lawsuit brought on behalf of americans on the list
but the aclu is nt satised with the government s new policy outlined in documents led monday in federal courts in oregon pdf and virginia pdf
after years of ghting in court for complete secrecy and losing it s good that the government is nally now going to tell people of their status on the no fly list said hina shamsi director of the aclu national security project and the lead attorney on the case in a statement
unfortunately we ve found that the government s new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice evidence and a hearing

an ofcial with knowledge of the government s gures told cnn in that the list contained about names including about americans
before the change american citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither conrmed nor denied their inclusion on the list
now they ll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress with an option to request further information

citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the no fly list the department of homeland security said in a statement
in cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status the government will provide a second more detailed response identifying specic criterion under which the individual has been placed on the no fly list according to the court documents
an unclassied summary of that information will be provided to the extent feasible consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake court papers said
those who appear on the list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing with supporting materials or exhibits and will receive a nal written decision from the transportation security administration
the ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge

booker said that detonating a suicide bomb is his no
aspiration because he could nt be captured all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target the criminal complaint said
he made a video with a fort riley aireld in the background and said isis was coming to kill american soldiers both abroad and in the united states the complaint said
booker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components the complaint said
the plan was for condential informants to build a bomb and for booker to drive to fort riley and detonate it the complaint said
but the bomb was built with inert parts and would never explode the complaint said

synchronization of neural activity appears in different parts of the mammalian cerebral cortex and underlies different neural processes in both normal and anomalous brain functions
it has been suggested that synchronization plays a vital role in information processing in the brain e

processing information from different sensory systems to form a coherent and unied perception of the external world
on the other hand synchronization has been detected in pathological conditions such as parkinson s disease
and epileptic seizures have long been considered resulting from excessive synchronized brain activity though some recent studies suggest that this picture may be an over simplication
therefore understanding the mechanisms of synchronization may be a critical step in elucidating how neural systems work
it has stimulated a great deal of theoretical and numerical works such as the studies on the effects of the topological properties of underlying networks and the dynamical properties of synaptic coupling
it was recently shown that the response time of synaptic couplings inuences the stability of synchronized oscillation in the nonlocally coupled hodgkin huxley hh equations
if the response time of synaptic coupling is slower synchronized activity of the systems is instable for excitatory coupling
however the underlying dynamical mechanism of the inuence is not clear
in experimental studies it has been suggested that the generation of prolonged epileptiform neuronal synchronization is favored by lower efcacy of synaptic transmission
the numerical studies in a detailed computational model revealed that seizure like activity occurs when the excitatory synapses are weakened and the results were conrmed experimentally in mouse neocortical slices
according to the common accepted assumption that synchronization of neuronal activity underlies seizures the dynamical mechanism of synchronization may be useful for understanding the way the biological neural system works
in this work we numerically investigated the dynamical mechanism underlying the inuence of synaptic efcacy on ring synchronization in hh neuron networks
to do this we rst studied the dynamics of the response of hh neuron to excitatory synaptic current
when the efcacy of synapse is low namely strength is weak and duration is short the limit cycle is stable to the perturbation of the synaptic current
when synaptic efcacy is high synaptic current can induce the transition of the neurons from limit cycle to xed point or transient state
the transition is determined by dynamics of neuron s ionic channel
the decrease of synaptic current depresses the feedback of sodium ionic current which is responsible for the initiation of the spike
for simplicity we will refer to the transitions as spike death
in neuronal networks synaptic input of a neuron is the accumulation of the currents received from all presynaptic neurons
when the coherence of ring time of neurons is enhanced by the excitatory interaction the synaptic input of neurons transforms from the uctuating waveform into the pulse shape like the signal produced by one synapse
if synaptic efcacy is high the input signal can induce spike death of the neuron
then spike death disorders the adjustment of the rhythm of neurons and prevents neurons from ring spikes synchronously
in contrast for synapses of lower efcacy the duration of synaptic current is too short to induce spike death of neurons
additionally the ring synchronization is different from synchronous activity of oscillators for the existence of the transitions of neuron s state
the paper is organized as follows
the hh neuron model and the synaptic coupling were introduced in sec
the response of a hh neuron to synaptic current was investigated in sec
the inuence of the dynamics of neurons on ring synchrony was shown in sec
we investigated the inuence of efcacy of synaptic interaction on ring synchronization in excitatory neuronal networks
we found spike death phenomena namely the state of neurons transits from limit cycle to xed point or transient state
the phenomena occur under the perturbation of excitatory synaptic interaction that has a high efcacy
we showed that the decrease of synaptic current results in spike death through depressing the feedback of sodium ionic current
in the networks with spike death property the degree of synchronization is lower and unsensitive to the heterogeneity of neurons
the mechanism of the inuence is that the transition of neuron state disrupts the adjustment of the rhythm of neuron oscillation and prevents further increase of ring synchronization
article reference summary ctrlsum the main contributions of this paper are we investigated the dynamical mechanism underlying the inuence of synaptic efcacy on ring synchrony in hodgkin huxley neuron networks we found that the dynamics of synaptic current plays an important role in determining the stability of ring synchronization

for the understanding of surface reactions and the characterization of materials it is desirable to measure local forces close to a sample surface
the most common method to measure these surface forces is atomic force microscopy
historically the rst force measurements were static measurements for which the force is presented as a scalar function of the static tip sample separation the so called force
this representation is sufcient for conservative forces but the total tip surface force may also contain contributions from dissipative forces
since dissipative forces depend on probe velocity and past trajectory dynamic force spectroscopy methods are required for their measurement
moreover the visualization of dissipative forces as a function of position is valid only for a specic probe trajectory and simple force curves can not capture the full character of the interaction
despite the development of several dynamic surface forces are still usually treated as functions of the probe position only and represented by simple force curves
here we present a comprehensive framework for the representation and analysis of complex surface forces as they are measured by dynamic afm
we concentrate on the most common modes of dynamic afm amplitude modulated afm am afm and frequency modulated afm fm afm which can be considered as narrow frequency band
we explore the fundamental limit of force reconstruction with narrow band dynamic afm at xed probe height and show how minimal assumptions allow for a quantitative reconstruction of the tip surface interaction
at the heart of the afm apparatus is a micro cantilever with a sharp tip
the cantilever is rmly clamped at one end and the tip is located at the other end which can move freely
it is assumed that surface forces only act on the tip whereas the rest of the cantilever does not experience signicant surface forces
in dynamic afm an additional external drive force is applied to maintain an oscillatory motion
thus the dynamics are governed by the force between tip and surface the external drive force and the properties of the cantilever beam
since the cantilever is a three dimensional continuum object its motion is usually described by the amplitudes of different oscillation eigenmodes
in general these modes can cause the cantilever to bend in all directions in space
however the cantilever is positioned such that the softest exural modes bend the beam in a plane orthogonal to the surface plane
we restrict ourselves to the case where only these exural modes are excited by the drive force
due to this experimental conguration the cantilever is much more susceptible to the component of the tip surface force which is orthogonal to the surface plane
this component of the force is typically the most dominant component and the inuence of lateral force components is considered negligible
in this case the cantilever acts as a mechanical projector which reacts only to one component of a three dimensional force vector eld
the deection of a cantilever of length orthogonal to surface is described by a one dimensional euler bernoulli where is the young s modulus is the second moment of area is the mass per unit length of the cantilever is the position coordinate along the cantilever beam and is the time variable
the force term includes the surface forces acting as a point like load at position the external drive force and the hydrodynamic damping due to the surrounding
in atomic force microscopy afm tip surface interactions are usually considered as functions of the tip position only so called force curves
however tip surface interactions often depend on the tip velocity and the past tip trajectory
here we introduce a compact and general description of these interactions appropriate to dynamic afm where the measurement of force is restricted to a narrow frequency band
we represent the tip surface interaction in terms of a force disk in the phase space of position and velocity
determination of the amplitude dependence of tip surface forces at a xed static probe height allows for a comprehensive treatment of conservative and dissipative interactions
we illuminate the fundamental limitations of force reconstruction with narrow band dynamic afm and we show how the amplitude dependence of the fourier component of the force at the tip oscillation frequency gives qualitative insight into the detailed nature of the tip surface interaction
with minimal assumptions this amplitude dependence force spectroscopy allows for a quantitative reconstruction of the effective conservative tip surface force as well as a position dependent damping factor
we demonstrate this reconstruction on simulated intermodulation afm data

in this paper we discuss the mathematical aspects of the problems originating in the solution of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations
these equations describe a large variety of physical phenomena such as gasdynamics magnetohydrodynamics mhd shallow water equations elasticity equations
being nonlinear these systems usually require numerical methods for their solution
presence of discontinuous solutions motivates the necessity of the development of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental mathematical properties of hyperbolic systems
although such methods are rather well developed for the euler gasdynamic equations in the conservation law form their extension to more complicated hyperbolic systems is not straightforward
it requires a mathematical justication of the solution uniqueness a formulation of the selection principles for relevant solutions and nally an investigation of their physical validity
most of high resolution methods for gasdynamic equations use the exact or some of the approximate self similar riemann problem solutions to determine uxes through the computational cell surfaces
similar methods are expected to be developed for various types of hyperbolic systems
in this case we must construct the elementary self similar solution using only admissible discontinuities entropy consistent evolutionary

basically the choice of the solution must be made on the basis of the structure of the solution of the extended problem
all mentioned above makes very important the study of discontinuous solutions behavior under vanishing viscosity and dispersion to create a proper background for the development of high resolution numerical methods for hyperbolic systems more complicated than the euler equations of gasdynamics
we discuss several analytical and numerical solutions in the mentioned elds which illustrate the complexity of the selection problem and outline the methods of its solution
tvd upwind and symmetric differencing schemes have recently become very efcient tool for solving complex multi shocked gasdynamic ows
this is due to their robustness for strong shock wave calculations
the extension of these schemes to the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics is not simple
rst the exact solution of the mhd riemann problem is too multivariant to be used in regular calculations
second several different approximate solvers and applied to mhd equations are now at the stage of investigation and comparison
this investigation requires i determination of a proper slope limiting method in the parameter interpolation procedure necessary to obtain nonoscillatory schemes of the order of accuracy higher than one development of an efcient entropy correction method necessary to exclude rarefaction shocks and nally solution of the problem of excluding the origin of nonevolutionary solutions in ideal mhd calculations
the system of governing equations for a mhd ow of an ideal innitely conducting perfect plasma in the cartesian coordinate system with the use of the conventional notations reads one uid approximation where is the vector of conservative variables and and are the ux vectors
we introduced here the source term in the form this form of the system can be used to satisfy the divergence free condition by convecting away the magnetic charge from the computational region
otherwise any other well known method can be used to eliminate the magnetic charge
to determine a numerical ux normal to the computational cell boundary is a unit outward vector normal to the cell surface one can use the formulas based on the solution of the linearized problem
here and are the matrices formed by the right and by the left eigenvectors respectively of the frozen jacobian matrix the matrix is a diagonal matrix consisting of the frozen jacobian matrix eigenvalue moduli
the superscripts and denote the values at the and at the left hand side of the cell boundary
a number of physical phenomena are described by nonlinear hyperbolic equations
presence of discontinuous solutions motivates the necessity of development of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental mathematical properties of hyperbolic systems
construction of such methods for systems more complicated than the euler gas dynamic equations requires the investigation of existence and uniqueness of the self similar solutions to be used in the development of discontinuity capturing high resolution numerical methods
this frequently necessitates the study of the behavior of discontinuities under vanishing viscosity and dispersion
we discuss these problems in the application to the magnetohydrodynamic equations nonlinear waves in elastic media and electromagnetic wave propagation in magnetics
the main contributions of this paper are the mathematical aspects of the problems originating in the solution of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations the study of discontinuous solutions behavior under vanishing viscosity and dispersion to create a proper background for the development of high resolution numerical methods for hyperbola systems more complicated than the euler equations of gasdynamics and solution of the problem of excluding the origin of nonevolutionary solutions in ideal magnetohydrodynamics calculations

article referring to the drawings and in particular to therein illustrated is a prior art surgical support mesh
mesh may be manufactured from monolament or multilament yarns
prior art mesh as shown includes multilament horizontally extending yarns and multilament vertically extending yarns woven together to form a support trellis
the use of multilament yarns such as yarns and provides a mesh having greater pliability and suppleness than the use of monolament yarns
these characteristics result from both the smaller diameter of the individual laments and the interstitial spaces or voids that are located between such laments
in particular the exibility of a lament or ber generally increases as its diameter decreases
because the solid cross sectional area of the laments of a multilament yarn is less than the cross sectional area of a monolament yarn of equivalent diameter the multilament yarn will have a greater degree of exibility and pliability than that of the monolament yarn
as shown in a each of multilament yarns and is composed of a plurality of laments that are intermingled or bundled together to form the yarn
interstitial spaces which are pockets of air are formed between adjacent laments of the yarn
although these voids contribute to the softness and pliability of the formed mesh they also provide a natural breeding ground for bacteria or other infectious material
surgical mesh is of course thoroughly sterilized prior to implantation
nevertheless surgeons typically prefer the use of monolament designed mesh to minimize any risk of infection
as a result the advantages associated with multilament designed mesh i
e
softness and pliability which result in better assimilation of the mesh into the body are typically sacriced
it has been discovered herein that a surgical support mesh having both the softness and pliability of a multilament designed mesh and the infection resistance of a monolament designed mesh may be produced
particularly it has been discovered that a support trellis formed of multilament yarn wherein the interstitial voids located between adjacent laments are enclosed within an infection impervious matrix exhibits the desired resistance to harboring of infectious matter without signicant loss of exibility
particularly the matrix which completely encloses the interstitial voids between the laments of the yarn provides an effective barrier to the passage of infectious matter between the interior and exterior of the yarn
accordingly any voids remaining in the yarn after encapsulation of such yarn are enclosed and thereby sealed within the resultant matrix
a rst embodiment of the present invention is shown in
particularly this rst embodiment includes a support trellis formed of multilament yarns and which overlap at cross over junctions
subsequent to forming of the trellis such trellis is encapsulated within a matrix which is preferably a exible material that continuously surrounds the exterior of the yarns thereby enclosing interstitial voids located between laments see a
in one embodiment the matrix is formed from a polymeric resin
as shown in a the resin can be applied to the yarn in such a manner as to not allow the resin to substantially penetrate into the yarn
particularly the penetration of the resin can be controlled through the application procedure e
g
quantity of resin applied and or encapsulating time
in such an embodiment the interstitial spaces are enclosed rather than lled within the continuous matrix
however it is contemplated that the resin can be allowed to penetrate into the yarn thereby substantially lling the void space located therein
in another embodiment of the present invention individual yarns as shown in are encapsulated within matrix prior to forming of the support trellis
a shows a compressed yarn which provides a trellis having a reduced thickness
as a result of the encapsulation interstitial voids remaining in the yarn are enclosed and thereby sealed within the matrix
reference summary a soft and pliable surgical support mesh exhibiting increased resistance to inhabitation of infectious matter
the mesh includes a support trellis formed of multilament yarns wherein the interstitial voids located between the laments of said yarns are enclosed within an infection impervious matrix
the meshes may be designed to be extremely thin yet retain the requisite strength for repairing soft tissue which allows for a low prole when folded for delivery
ctrlsum the purpose of the present invention is to provide a surgical mesh that is resistant to the growth of bacteria and other infectious matter
this is accomplished by encapsulating the interstitial spaces located between the laments of the yarn within a matrix

referring now to the drawings and more particularly to a uid system is illustrated and includes a variable displacement axial piston pump that receives uid from a tank via a conduit and delivers pressurized uid via a supply conduit to a uid control valve and selectively through work conduits to a uid actuator
in the subject arrangement the variable displacement axial piston pump is a unidirectional pump that rotates in a counterclockwise direction as driven by a power input shaft
the uid system also includes rst and second pressure sensors respectively connected to the tank conduit and the supply conduit
the pressure sensors are operative to sense the pressure in the respective lines and deliver an electrical signal to a controller through electrical lines
a position sensor is mounted on the variable displacement axial piston pump and operative to sense the displacement of the pump and deliver a signal representative thereof to the controller via an electrical line
various other components could be used in the subject uid system without departing from the essence of the subject invention
for example several control valves and associated uid actuators could be used
likewise other sensors of various types and styles could be used
the variable displacement axial piston pump includes a housing having a head portion and a body portion
the head portion denes an inlet port passage that is connected to the conduit and an outlet port passage that is connected to the supply conduit
in the subject arrangement a port plate is disposed between the head portion and the body portion
the construction of the porting within the port plate is more clearly illustrated in and will be discussed more fully below
it is recognized that the porting illustrated in could be made within the head portion without departing from the essence of the subject invention
a rotating group is disposed within the body portion and includes a barrel having a plurality of cylinder bores dened therein spaced from one another around an axis of rotation of the barrel
each of the cylinder bores is oriented within the barrel parallel with the axis of rotation
a plurality of piston assemblies are operatively associated with the barrel and each one of the plurality of piston assemblies includes a piston slideably disposed in the respective ones of the plurality of cylinder bores
each one of the plurality of piston assemblies also has a shoe pivotably attached to one end of each piston in a conventional manner
the barrel has an end surface that is in mating sealing contact with the port plate to provide communication between the cylinder bores and the respective inlet and outlet port passages of the head portion
a closed chamber is dened in each cylinder bore of the barrel between the end of the piston and the end surface thereof
referring to the porting between the barrel and inlet and outlet port passages of the head portion is more clearly illustrated

article tehran iran cnn iran s parliament speaker has criticized u
s
president elect barack obama for saying that iran s development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks u
s
policy needs to change
ali larijani said saturday that obama should apply his campaign message of change to u
s
dealings with iran
obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a supercial changing of colors or tactics larijani said in comments carried by the semi ofcial mehr news agency
what is expected is a change in strategy not the repetition of objections to iran s nuclear program which will be taking a step in the wrong direction
in his rst post election news conference friday afternoon obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear armed iran would be unacceptable
he also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening
larijani said that u
s
behavior toward iran will not change so simply but that obama s election showed internal conditions in the united states have shifted
he added that iran does not mind if the united states provides other persian gulf countries with nuclear technology but you should know that you can not prevent the islamic republic from reaching its goals in the nuclear eld according to the news agency
obama cautioned friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in ofce
obviously how we approach and deal with a country like iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee jerk fashion
i think we ve got to think it through obama said
but i have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time
and i want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that i am not the president and i wo nt be until january
larijani was speaking two days after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad congratulated obama the rst time an iranian leader has offered such wishes to a u
s
president elect since the islamic revolution
one analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the united states
ahmadinejad said tehran welcomes basic and fair changes in u
s
policies and conducts according to the state run islamic republic news agency on thursday
relations between the united states and iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over iran s nuclear program
tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes but the united states and other western nations are concerned by iran s refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities

tv whenever someone at our ofce bitches about being overworked our stock response is beats digging ditches
while the express intention of the statement is usually not so supportive we think it s a healthy reminder that at the end of the day we are all basically professional e mailers and should be thankful for such
the wildland reghters who work for grayback forestry in medford oregon have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches
around active forest res
on the sides of mountains
you ca nt even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older because they re all private sector contractors
which means if they are nt out ghting forest res or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods basically extreme landscaping they are losing money
they are the hardest working men in the tree business
southern oregon in the summer is a tinderbox
last year the state recorded some wild res the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the cascades to the pacic coast
humidity is next to nonexistent which is extremely pleasant but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze
flying into the rogue valley there is evidence of past wild res is everywhere from the miles long scar of the biscuit re stretching past the horizon to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue wilderness fireghter ribbon bumper stickers ying past on the to the elaborate wildre and reghter shrines at a local bar
see more of oregon fire lines at vbs
tv there are very few places remen are nt revered as local heroes but the wilderness reghters of oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed
they re literally the guardians of their communities
incidentally their work is also very benecial for the forest
we spent a few days following a crew of grayback walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn
this is what they like to call project work the light stuff they do between res
the work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do
unless you consider hour plus shifts of backbreaking labor virtually zero outside recognition and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards
which we do not

article washington cnn the nation s largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks according to a new report
in president bush visited the browns ferry nuclear plant operated by the tennessee valley authority
the tennessee valley authority which supplies power to almost million americans has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures leaving them vulnerable to disruption the government accountability ofce found
simply put that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout
rep
james langevin a rhode island democrat fears the problem is much larger than just the tva
if they are not secure i do nt have a great deal of condence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure he said
the tva operates nuclear hydroelectric and fossil fuel facilities in the southeastern united states
among the government watchdog agency ndings the tva s rewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately congured passwords are not effective servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection intrusion detection systems are not adequate some locations lack enough physical security around control systems
the gao recommends steps to correct the problems in its report to congress
in september cnn rst aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment
the experiment dubbed aurora caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system
the test was conducted by scientists at the idaho national laboratory
in october the north american electric reliability corp
told congress that percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the aurora vulnerability but langevin said it now appears that congress was misled
a congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation s claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to x the problem
it appears that they just made those numbers up langevin said
it is not acceptable
it is outrageous
he said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks
the electric reliability corporation a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers told cnn it regrets the confusion
experts told cnn that cooper industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the aurora vulnerability
the company estimated it would need to sell about devices to x the problem nationwide
it has sold just over it told cnn
langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps and he will press to give those powers to the federal energy regulatory commission
the congressman is chairing an emerging threats cybersecurity and science and technology subcommittee hearing wednesday afternoon
representatives of the tva the gao the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee
