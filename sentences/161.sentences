v i x r a abstract neural network based methods for tive summarization produce outputs that are more uent than other techniques but perform poorly at content selection
this work poses a simple technique for addressing this issue use a data efcient content selector to over determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary
we use this selector as a bottom up attention step to constrain the model to likely phrases
we show that this approach improves the ability to compress text while still generating uent summaries
this two step process is both pler and higher performing than other end end content selection models leading to nicant improvements on rouge for both the cnn dm and nyt corpus
furthermore the content selector can be trained with as little as sentences making it easy to transfer a trained summarizer to a new domain
introduction text summarization systems aim to generate ural language summaries that compress the mation in a longer text
approaches using ral networks have shown promising results on this task with end to end models that encode a source document and then decode it into an tive summary
current state of the art neural stractive summarization models combine tive and abstractive techniques by using generator style models which can copy words from the source document gu et al
see et al

these end to end models produce uent abstractive summaries but have had mixed success in content selection i
e
deciding what to summarize compared to fully extractive models
there is an appeal to end to end models from a modeling perspective however there is evidence that when summarizing people follow a two step source document german chancellor angela merkel did not look too pleased about the weather during her annual easter holiday in italy
as britain basks in sunshine and temperatures of up to mrs merkel and her husband chemistry professor joachim sauer had to settle for a measly degrees
the chancellor and her spouse have been spending easter on the small island of ischia near naples in the mediterranean for over a decade
not so sunny angela merkel and her husband chemistry professor joachim sauer are spotted on their annual easter trip to the island of ischia near naples
the couple traditionally spend their holiday at the star miramare spa hotel on the south of the island which comes with its own private beach and conies overlooking the ocean

figure example of two sentence summaries with and without bottom up attention
the model does not low copying of words in although it can erate words
with bottom up attention we see more explicit sentence compression while without it whole sentences are copied verbatim
approach of rst selecting important phrases and then paraphrasing them anderson and hidi jing and mckeown
a similar argument has been made for image captioning
son et al
develop a state of the art model with a two step approach that rst pre computes bounding boxes of segmented objects and then plies attention to these regions
this so called bottom up attention is inspired by neuroscience search describing attention based on properties herent to a stimulus buschman and miller
related work motivated by this approach we consider bottom up attention for neural abstractive marization
our approach rst selects a selection mask for the source document and then constrains a standard neural model by this mask
this approach can better decide which phrases a model should include in a summary without sacricing the uency advantages of neural abstractive marizers
furthermore it requires much fewer data to train which makes it more adaptable to new domains
our full model incorporates a separate content selection system to decide on relevant aspects of the source document
we frame this selection task as a sequence tagging problem with the tive of identifying tokens from a document that are part of its summary
we show that a tent selection model that builds on contextual word embeddings peters et al
can identify rect tokens with a recall of over and a cision of over
to incorporate bottom up attention into abstractive summarization models we employ masking to constrain copying words to the selected parts of the text which produces grammatical outputs
we additionally experiment with multiple methods to incorporate similar straints into the training process of more plex end to end abstractive summarization els either through multi task learning or through directly incorporating a fully differentiable mask
our experiments compare bottom up attention with several other state of the art abstractive tems
compared to our baseline models of see et al
bottom up attention leads to an provement in rouge l score on the cnn daily mail cnn dm corpus from
to
while being simpler to train
we also see comparable or better results than recent reinforcement learning based methods with our mle trained system
thermore we nd that the content selection model is very data efcient and can be trained with less than of the original training data
this vides opportunities for domain transfer and resource summarization
we show that a rization model trained on cnn dm and ated on the nyt corpus can be improved by over points in rouge l with a content selector trained on only in domain sentences
there is a tension in document summarization tween staying close to the source document and allowing compressive or abstractive modication
many non neural systems take a select and press approach
for example dorr et al
introduced a system that rst extracts noun and verb phrases from the rst sentence of a news ticle and uses an iterative shortening algorithm to compress it
recent systems such as durrett et al
also learn a model to select sentences and then compress them
in contrast recent work in neural network based data driven extractive summarization has focused on extracting and ordering full sentences cheng and lapata dlikman and last
lapati et al
use a classier to determine whether to include a sentence and a selector that ranks the positively classied ones
these ods often over extract but extraction at a word level requires maintaining grammatically correct output cheng and lapata which is cult
interestingly key phrase extraction while grammatical often matches closely in content with human generated summaries bui et al

a third approach is neural abstractive marization with sequence to sequence models sutskever et al
bahdanau et al

these methods have been applied to tasks such as headline generation rush et al
and article summarization nallapati et al

chopra et al
show that attention approaches that are more specic to summarization can further prove the performance of models
gu et al
were the rst to show that a copy mechanism troduced by vinyals et al
can combine the advantages of both extractive and abstractive summarization by copying words from the source
see et al
rene this pointer generator proach and use an additional coverage mechanism tu et al
that makes a model aware of its attention history to prevent repeated attention
most recently reinforcement learning rl proaches that optimize objectives for tion other than maximum likelihood have been shown to further improve performance on these tasks paulus et al
li et al
ilmaz et al

paulus et al
approach the coverage problem with an intra attention in which a decoder has an attention over previously generated words
however rl based training can be difcult to tune and slow to train
our method does not utilize rl training although in theory this approach can be adapted to rl methods
also papers several explore multi pass extractive abstractive summarization
pati et al
create a new source document comprised of the important sentences from the source and then train an abstractive system
liu et al
describe an extractive phase that extracts full paragraphs and an abstractive one that determines their order
finally zeng et al
introduce a mechanism that reads a source document in two passes and uses the information from the rst pass to bias the second
our method differs in that we utilize a completely abstractive model biased with a powerful content selector
other recent work explores alternative proaches to content selection
for example cohan et al
use a hierarchical attention to detect relevant sections in a document li et al
generate a set of keywords that is used to guide the summarization process and pasunuru and bansal develop a loss function based on whether salient keywords are included in a summary
other approaches investigate the content selection at the sentence level
tan et al
describe a based attention to attend to one sentence at a time chen and bansal rst extract full sentences from a document and then compress them and hsu et al
modulate the attention based on how likely a sentence is included in a summary
background neural summarization throughout this paper we consider a set of pairs of texts x y where x corresponds to source tokens


xn and y y to a summary


ym with m n
abstractive summaries are generated one word at a time
at every time step a model is aware of the previously generated words
the problem is to learn a function parametrized by that imizes the probability of generating the correct sequences
following previous work we model the abstractive summarization with an attentional sequence to sequence model
the attention bution for a decoding step j culated within the neural network represents an embedded soft distribution over all of the source tokens and can be interpreted as the current focus of the model
the model additionally has a copy figure overview of the selection and generation cesses described throughout section
nism vinyals et al
to copy words from the source
copy models extend the decoder by predicting a binary soft switch zj that determines whether the model copies or generates
the copy distribution is a probability distribution over the source text and the joint distribution is computed as a convex combination of the two parts of the model zj zj where the two parts represent copy and generation distribution respectively
following the generator model of see et al
we reuse the attention distribution as copy tribution i
e
the copy probability of a token in the source w through the copy attention is computed as the sum of attention towards all occurrences of w
during training we maximize marginal hood with the latent switch variable
bottom up attention we next consider techniques for incorporating a content selection into abstractive summarization illustrated in figure

content selection we dene the content selection problem as a level extractive summarization task
while there has been signicant work on custom extractive summarization see related work we make a plifying assumption and treat it as a sequence ging problem
let


tn denote binary tags for each of the source tokens i
e
if a word is copied in the target sequence and otherwise
while there is no supervised data for this task we can generate training data by aligning the maries to the document
we dene a word xi as sourcemasked sourcesummarycontent selectionbottom up attention copied if it is part of the longest possible sequence of tokens s xij i for integers i k n i if s and s y and there exists no earlier sequence u with s u
we use a standard bidirectional lstm model trained with maximum likelihood for the sequence labeling problem
recent results have shown that better word representations can lead to cantly improved performance in sequence tagging tasks peters et al

therefore we rst map each token wi into two embedding channels
the embedding represents a i static channel of pre trained word embeddings e

glove pennington et al

the are contextual embeddings from a pretrained language model e

elmo peters et al
which uses a character aware token embedding kim et al
followed by two bidirectional lstm ers
the contextual embeddings are i ne tuned to learn a task specic embedding i as a linear combination of the states of each lstm layer and the token embedding and i and i i sj i with and as trainable parameters
since these embeddings only add four additional eters to the tagger it remains very data efcient despite the high dimensional embedding space
both embeddings are concatenated into a gle vector that is used as input to a bidirectional lstm which computes a representation hi for a word wi
we can then calculate the probability that the word is selected as bs with trainable parameters ws and bs

bottom up copy attention inspired by work in bottom up attention for ages anderson et al
which restricts tion to predetermined bounding boxes within an image we use these attention masks to limit the available selection of the pointer generator model
as shown in figure a common mistake made by neural copy models is copying very long in the quences or even whole sentences
line model over of copied tokens are part of copy sequences that are longer than tokens whereas this number is only for reference summaries
while bottom up attention could also be used to modify the source encoder tions we found that a standard encoder over the full text was effective at aggregation and therefore limit the bottom up step to attention masking
concretely we rst train a pointer generator model on the full dataset as well as the content selector dened above
at inference time to erate the mask the content selector computes lection probabilities n for each token in a source document
the selection probabilities are used to modify the copy attention distribution to only clude tokens identied by the selector
let ai j note the attention at decoding step j to encoder word i
given a threshold the selection is plied as a hard mask such that qi
to ensure that eq
still yields a correct ity distribution we rst multiply by a normalization parameter and then malize the distribution
the resulting normalized distribution can be used to directly replace a as the new copy probabilities

end to end alternatives two step bottom up attention has the tage of training simplicity
in theory though dard copy attention should be able to learn how to perform content selection as part of the end to end training
we consider several other end to end proaches for incorporating content selection into neural training
method mask only we rst consider whether the alignment used in the bottom up proach could help a standard summarization tem
inspired by nallapati et al
we vestigate whether aligning the summary and the source during training and xing the gold copy tention to pick the correct source word is cial
we can think of this approach as limiting the set of possible copies to a xed source word
here the training is changed but no mask is used at test time
method multi task next we investigate whether the content selector can be trained side the abstractive system
we rst test this pothesis by posing summarization as a multi task problem and training the tagger and tion model with the same features
for this setup we use a shared encoder for both abstractive marization and content selection
at test time we apply the same masking method as bottom up tention
method diffmask finally we sider training the full system end to end with the mask during training
here we jointly timize both objectives but use predicted tion probabilities to softly mask the copy attention which leads to a fully differentiable model
this model is used with the same soft mask at test time
inference several authors have noted that longer form neural generation still has signicant issues with rect length and repeated words than in short form problems like translation
proposed solutions clude modifying models with extensions such as a coverage mechanism tu et al
see et al
or intra sentence attention cheng et al
paulus et al

we instead stick to the theme of modifying inference and modify the scoring function to include a length penalty lp and a coverage penalty cp and is dened as y log
length to encourage the generation of longer sequences we apply length normalizations during beam search
we use the length penalty by wu et al
which is formulated as with a tunable parameter where increasing leads to longer summaries
we additionally set a minimum length based on the training data
repeats copy models often repeatedly attend to the same source tokens generating the same phrase multiple times
we introduce a new mary specic coverage penalty n max
n aj i
m intuitively this penalty increases whenever the decoder directs more than
of total attention within a sequence towards a single encoded ken
by selecting a sufciently high this penalty blocks summaries whenever they would lead to repetitions
additionally we follow paulus et al
and restrict the beam search to never repeat trigrams
data and experiments we evaluate our approach on the cnn dm pus hermann et al
nallapati et al
and the nyt corpus sandhaus which are both standard corpora for news summarization
the summaries for the cnn dm corpus are let points for the articles shown on their respective websites whereas the nyt corpus contains maries written by library scientists
cnn dm summaries are full sentences with on average tokens and
bullet points
nyt maries are not always complete sentences and are shorter with on average tokens and
bullet points
following see et al
we use the non anonymized version of the cnn dm corpus and truncate source documents to kens and the target summaries to tokens in training and validation sets
for experiments with the nyt corpus we use the preprocessing scribed by paulus et al
and additionally remove author information and truncate source documents to tokens instead of
these changes lead to an average of tokens per cle a decrease from the tokens with token truncated articles
the target non copy lary is limited to tokens for all models
the content selection model uses pre trained glove embeddings of size and elmo with size
the bi lstm has two layers and a den size of
dropout is set to
and the model is trained with adagrad an initial learning rate of
and an initial accumulator value of

we limit the number of training examples to on either corpus which only has a small impact on performance
for the jointly trained content selection models we use the same uration as the abstractive model
for the base model we re implemented the pointer generator model as described by see et al

to have a comparable number of ters to previous work we use an encoder with hidden states for both directions in the one layer lstm and for the one layer decoder
the embedding size is set to
the model is trained with the same adagrad conguration as the tent selector
additionally the learning rate halves after each epoch once the validation perplexity does not decrease after an epoch
we do not use dropout and use gradient clipping with a mum norm of

table results of abstractive summarizers on the cnn dm dataset

the second section describes reinforcement learning based proaches
the third section presents our baselines and the attention masking methods described in this work
can lead to slightly improved performance but at the cost of increased training time and rameters
we report numbers of a transformer with copy attention which we denote former
in this model we randomly choose one of the attention heads as the copy distribution and otherwise follow the parameters of the big former by vaswani et al

from results table shows our main results on the dm corpus with abstractive models shown in the top and bottom up attention methods at the bottom
we rst observe that using a age inference penalty scores the same as a full coverage mechanism without requiring any tional model parameters or model ne tuning
the results with the copytransformer and coverage penalty indicate a slight improvement across all three scores but we observe no signicant ence between pointer generator and former with bottom up attention
we found that none of our end to end models lead to improvements indicating that it is cult to apply the masking during training out hurting the training process
the mask only model with increased supervision on the copy mechanism performs very similar to the task model
on the other hand bottom up tion leads to a major improvement across all three scores
while we would expect better content lection to primarily improve the fact all three increase hints that the uency is not ing hurt specically

we see that the point improvement compared to the baseline generator maximum likelihood approach carries over to this dataset
here the model outperforms the rl based model by paulus et al
in and but not l and is comparable to the results of celikyilmaz et al
except for rouge l
the same can be observed when comparing ml and our pointer generator
we suspect that a difference in summary lengths due to our inference parameter choices leads to this difference but did not have access to their els or summaries to investigate this claim
this shows that a bottom up approach achieves petitive results even to models that are trained on summary specic objectives
the main benet of bottom up summarization seems to be from the reduction of mistakenly copied words
with the best pointer generator models the precision of copied words is
compared to the reference
this precision creases to
which mostly drives the increase in
an independent samples t test shows that this improvement is statistically signicant with
p
we also observe a decrease in average sentence length of summaries from to words when adding content selection pared to the pointer generator while holding all other inference parameters constant
domain transfer while end to end training has become common there are benets to a step method
since the content selector only needs figure the auc of the content selector trained on cnn dm with different training set sizes ranging from to data points
to solve a binary tagging problem with pretrained vectors it performs well even with very limited training data
as shown in figure with only sentences the model achieves an auc of over
beyond that size the auc of the model increases only slightly with increasing training data
to further evaluate the content selection we consider an application to domain transfer
in this experiment we apply the pointer generator trained on cnn dm to the nyt corpus
in dition we train three content selectors on and thousand sentences of the nyt set and use these in the bottom up summarization
the results shown in table demonstrates that even a model trained on the smallest subset leads to an improvement of almost points over the model without bottom up attention
this improvement increases with the larger subsets to up to points
while this approach does not reach a ble performance to models trained directly on the nyt dataset it still represents a signicant crease over the not augmented cnn dm model and produces summaries that are quite readable
we show two example summaries in appendix a
this technique could be used for low resource mains and for problems with limited data ability

table results of extractive approaches on the cnn dm dataset
the rst section shows extractive scores
the second section rst shows an oracle score if the content selector selected all the rect words according to our matching heuristic
finally we show results when the content selector extracts all phrases above a selection probability threshold
article
shows the performance when we extract the top three sentences by average copy probability from the selector
interestingly with this method only
of the top three sentences are not within the rst three further reinforcing the strength of the baseline
our naive sentence extractor performs slightly worse than the highest reported extractive score by zhou et al
that is specically trained to score nations of sentences
the nal entry shows the performance when all the words above a threshold are extracted such that the resulting summaries are approximately the length of reference summaries
the oracle score represents the results if our model had a perfect accuracy and shows that the tent selector while yielding competitive results has room for further improvements in future work
this result shows that the model is quite tive at nding important words but less effective at chaining them together
similar to paulus et al
we nd that the decrease in indicates a lack of uency and grammaticality of the generated summaries
a table novel shows the percentage of words in a summary that are not in the source document
the last three columns show the part of speech tag distribution of the novel words in generated summaries
typical example looks like this a man food his rst hamburger fully for years
michael hanline was convicted of murder for the ing of truck driver jt mcgarry in on judge charges
this particular ungrammatical example has a of

this further highlights the benet of the combined approach where up predictions are chained together uently by the abstractive system
however we also note that the abstractive system requires access to the full source document
distillation experiments in which we tried to use the output of the selection as training input to abstractive models showed a drastic decrease in model performance
analysis of copying while pointer generator models have the ability to abstract in summary the use of a copy mechanism causes the summaries to be mostly extractive
table shows that with copying the percentage of generated words that are not in the source document decreases from
to
while reference summaries are much more abstractive with
novel words
bottom up attention leads to a further reduction to only a half percent
however since generated summaries are typically not longer than words the ference between an abstractive system with and without bottom up attention is less than one novel word per summary
this shows that the benet of abstractive models has been less in their ity to produce better paraphrasing but more in the ability to create uent summaries from a mostly extractive process
table also shows the part of speech tags of the novel generated words and we can observe an interesting effect
application of bottom up tion leads to a sharp decrease in novel adjectives data pointer generator length penalty coverage penalty trigram repeat r l











table results on cnn dm when adding one ence penalty at a time
conclusion this work presents a simple but accurate tent selection model for summarization that ties phrases within a document that are likely cluded in its summary
we showed that this tent selector can be used for a bottom up tion that restricts the ability of abstractive marizers to copy words from the source
the combined bottom up summarization system leads to improvements in rouge scores of over two points on both the cnn dm and nyt corpora
a comparison to end to end trained methods showed that this particular problem can not be easily solved with a single model but instead requires tuned inference restrictions
finally we showed that this technique due to its data efciency can be used to adjust a trained model with few data points making it easy to transfer to a new main
preliminary work that investigates similar bottom up approaches in other domains that quire a content selection such as grammar tion or data to text generation have shown some promise and will be investigated in future work

figure for all copied words we show the tion over the length of copied phrases they are part of
the black lines indicate the reference summaries and the bars the summaries with and without bottom up tention
and nouns whereas the fraction of novel words that are verbs sharply increases
when looking at the novel verbs that are being generated we notice a very high percentage of tense or number changes indicated by variation of the word say for example said or says while novel nouns are mostly morphological variants of words in the source
figure shows the length of the phrases that are being copied
while most copied phrases in the reference summaries are in groups of to words the pointer generator copies many very long quences and full sentences of over words
since the content selection mask interrupts most long copy sequences the model has to either ate the unselected words using only the tion probability or use a different word instead
while we observed both cases quite frequently in generated summaries the fraction of very long copied phrases decreases
however either with or without bottom up attention the distribution of the length of copied phrases is still quite different from the reference
inference penalty analysis we next analyze the effect of the inference time loss functions
ble presents the marginal improvements over the simple pointer generator when adding one penalty at a time
we observe that all three ties improve all three scores even when added on top of the other two
this further indicates that the unmodied pointer generator model has ready learned an appropriate representation of the abstractive summarization problem but is limited by its ineffective content selection and inference methods
