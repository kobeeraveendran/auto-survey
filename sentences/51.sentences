china aston university birmingham uk abstract summarization is one of the key features of human intelligence
it plays an important role in understanding and representation
with rapid and continual expansion of texts pictures and videos in cyberspace automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable
text summarization has been studied for over half century but it is still hard to automatically erate a satisfied summary
traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding
this paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi dimensional classification space introduces a multi dimensional methodology for research and development unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization studies the dimensions and forms of tions and proposes a multi dimensional evaluation mechanisms
investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos graphs and tures and then reaches a general summarization framework
further some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex space consisting of cyberspace physical space and social space
the basic viewpoints include a representation suitable for summarization should have a core indicated by its intention and extension summarization is an open process of various interactions involved in various explicit and implicit citations and the form of summary is diverse and summarization carries out through multiple dimensions

introduction versatile summaries accompany our daily life
some summaries are mainly in form of text such as the abstracts of scientific papers the prefaces of books the tables of contents cvs the headlines of news webpages with hyperlinks book reviews wikipedia and the results of web search
some summaries incorporate pictures videos graphs or tables into texts
applications include web tals such as yahoo youtube posters slides medical certificate tv guides advertisements and conference programs
a good summary should be able to quickly attract attention represent the core idea and effectively convey the meaning according to interests
these summaries that people often see are made by humans

automatic text summarization the development of cyberspace accelerates the expansion of texts since people can more and more easily and freely publish writings
efficiently finding necessary contents in the ocean of texts is very important because life is short while new texts are continually generated
with the development of sciences researchers are limited in time and energy to read more and more publications
researchers have to focus on the literature within recent years
this has led to more and more reinventions
original innovation especially systematic and fundamental innovation has become more and more difficult
automatic summarization is a natural idea to solve this problem
researchers have made great efforts to find the better solution
however existing approaches are empirical and focus on special types of text
it is necessary to review previous efforts and explore the foundation of summarization
there are different definitions of text summarization
the common point is regarding text marization as an automatic process of distilling the most important language representation units from a text to produce an abridged version for a particular task and user mani and maybury mani
the generic summarizers usually generate important contents in without considering users
the query focused summarizers generate responses to user queries
the extractive summarizers lect appropriate phrases or sentences from the text and then compose them
the abstractive rizers can use different probably more general words to represent the main meaning of text
so far most text summarizers are extractive
important sentences can be extracted out according to the tistical analysis and experience on the input text while making abstraction needs knowledge on and beyond the text
automatic text summarization systems generally concern the following three issues selection
scan and extract important language units e

sentences
ordering
determine the order of the extracted units
realization
compose the extracted units to get fluent new text

summarization of summarization literature a multi dimensional perspective research on automatic text summarization started half century ago luhn et al
dale
research methods can be summarized by a multi dimensional classification space zhuge as shown in figure
methods can be classified by input and output
there are three types of inputs single text luhn al
multiple texts mckeown radev al
nanba al
agarwal et al
and hybrid which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them so that readers can know more relevant contents
it is useful in summarizing a scientific topic v
qazvinian and d

radev chen and zhuge
there are two types of outputs extractive summarization extracting important sentences from the given text edmundson mihalcea shen et al
and synthesized summarization summarization is a reformulated compressed abstracted or synthesized text mckeown al
knight
sentences in output should be coherent to facilitate ers understanding brandow et al regina barzilay and mirella lapata
methods can also be classified by techniques as follows information fusion
summary is generated by identifying themes in text and selecting priate sentences for composition barzilay barzilay kckeown
information retrieval
features such as frequency of words and phrases locations and ranks of sentences were used to extract important sentences baxendale edmundson
machine learning
machine learning methods apply statistical techniques to extraction cluding bayes methods kupiec al
daum and marcu rich features and decision trees lin and hovy markov models conroy neural networks nenkova classification teufel pang and lee and hybrid machine learning method fattah
natural language analysis
methods based on natural language analysis were used in marization barzilay al
silber and mccoy erkan
classification and clustering
classification and clustering are the basic components of the multi document summarization methods
it is usually used with graph analysis and mation retrieval erkan hilda hardy
applications include summarizing tive and negative classifications in texts hu and liu pang and lee
semantics based
cognition scientists simulated human reading and understanding process as a series of propositions input and reduction cycles kintsch and dijk britton and graesser
text understanding is modeled by proposition network
the latent semantic analysis technique was used to identify semantically important sentences
summarization patterns were discussed gong and liu
discovering semantic community is a way to summarize a network of language units zhuge
other methods including information extraction extracting entities relations and structures document compression ranking method rau al
daum iii al
bonell probabilistic approaches knight qazvinian al
and tion based approaches abu jbara and radev elkiss et al

the faceted tion approach is not traditional text summarization but it is a special summarization because it can extract different facets in large to enable users to read only the interested facet xu and zhuge
similarly the association relation between words was used for ti document summarization o

the approach to summarizing differences between document groups was studied wang al

evaluation concerns human semi automatic and automatic methods based on the pre defined standards mani and maybury
methods for creating and evaluating summaries are usually coordinated each other hahn
every point in the space coordinates all methods specified at every dimensions
text summarization research has been extended to multi medias and social events
summarizing videos is a research topic in multimedia area dementhon et al

a multi dimensional classification space of summarization methods

characteristics of text summarization previous research methods have the following characteristics from text to text
the main focus of research is on text itself
it is a natural idea to select and organize important sentences from the original text to form a summary
a different opinion is that language representations e

words and sentences indicate semantics ther than semantics itself and interaction plays an important role in representation and derstanding zhuge
and the knowledge for summarization is often beyond text
for example a love story is the high level summarization of a novel but the word story may not be an important word in the novel or it even does not appear in the novel
why can human use words beyond text an explanation is that humans have commonsense on resentation a novel tells a story and representation story
automation
summarization process excludes humans
it is ideal and efficient but rization systems do not have minds and experiences as human
humans experience with representation at multiple levels understanding and summarization in lifetime
adding a ground with more indicators to a summary is a way to help representation and ing e

a love story in qing dynasty of china includes a time indicator qing dynasty and a location indicator china
but automatic summarization exclude interaction bly leads to an awkward summary
closed system
the process of automatic summarization is closed does not interact with other processes in cyberspace or social space
actually reviews and comments in space are open easily available and valuable for composing and improving summaries

questions many areas such as information retrieval and classification have significantly influenced research on summarization
methodology has not been formed to guide research and development
it is critical for developing summarization research through thinking the following questions what is summarization whether the best summary of a given representation exists or not what are the fundamental principles and rules of language use and understanding behind summarization what is the appropriate research methodology for studying summarization and developing summarization systems whether a general summarization exists or not
summarization and dimensions summarization is involved in representation and understanding
in language study students are often requested to make summarizations after reading articles
scientists summarize their ideas as abstracts placed before the main texts in papers so that readers can quickly know the main idea fore reading the main text
survey papers are summarizations of previous works on particular topics
humans have the ability to represent and summarize what they have read
this ability can be hanced through language learning using and understanding for example journalists are specialized in summarizing events as news in the form that can attract readers
a text can be understood from different aspects because of the nature of language use and understanding
humans have the ability to summarize non symbol representations which can be regarded as a different dimension from text
for example people can write summaries after attending conferences watching movies visiting museums and traveling in the physical space
summarization enables people from novice to experts to quickly know the general and important information
humans live in a multi dimensional space
the ability to understand think through and use mensions is an important part of human intelligence
the physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time region and type different types of museums may include different samples
a set of representations can be classified by different methods
regarding each method as a mension forms a multi dimensional classification space where every point represents a class that has a projection at every dimension
for example a publication space can include the following sions subject time author and publisher
the classification space can be normalized to ensure the effectiveness of operations on the space just like the normal forms of relational database
in a plex multi dimensional classification space a dimension can be a hierarchy of classifications and one point can be semantically linked to another zhuge
objects can be located in a space of multiple dimensions such as time topic and publication type book journal or conference for efficient retrieval and management
a representation can be summarized from different dimensions

multi dimensional methodology there are different viewpoints on text understanding
for example rationalism believes that the meaning of text is determined by its structure and derivation rules
the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined by human minds and genetically transmitted
mans share the same underlying linguistic structure chomsky
social constructivism believes that any text is involved in society e

in power relationships and history m
foucault
evolutionism concerns the process of mental development and innate mental structures stern
the innate mental structure that equips a man especially a child to interact with the world includes more than chomsky s universal grammar of linguistic structure
the cyberspace physical space and social space have structures and the brains have evolved with ways to recognize and represent these structures and the structure of themselves
more phenomena have shown that what a man especially a child learns about the world is based on an innate mental structure carthy
rationalism any method is limited in its inventor s knowledge and understandings of problems
integrating different methods is a way to break the limitations
various methods can be organized in a ti dimensional methodological space as shown in figure
each dimension consists of some specific methods
complex methodology evolutionism empiricism social constructionism figure
a multi dimensional methodological space
pragmatism the space involves in the following high level dimensions zhuge empiricism
it believes that knowledge comes from experience and emphasizes evidence especially data sensed through equipment or derived from experiment
it assumes that knowledge including method is convincible and reliable at least within a certain scope
evolutionism
it believes that complex systems or species develop through evolution
maries should be able to evolve with various interactions in the complex space like the tion of the contents in wikipedia
writers readers and languages evolve and influence each other
individual and social constructionism
it believes that meaning and understanding develop with individual and society
for summarization writing and reading involve in both ual thinking and social experience and interaction
rationalism
it regards reasoning as the main source of knowledge
rational study derives new theories and methods according to existing theories methods and phenomena
pragmatism
it argues that knowledge comes from practical use
research should be useful and benefit human life and social development
solving the problems emerged in practice provides instances for rational thinking and verification
different dimensions regulate different classes of method
coordinating different dimensions is a way to generate new methods
a complex methodology is regulated by a subspace or a point which has a projection at every dimension of the methodology space
this paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions cially from empiricism rationalism evolutionism and social individual constructionism so as to form a general summarization methodology

basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding as a kind of language representation summarization should be based on the basic principles of guage use
observing and rethinking the basic characteristics of human language use can inspire search on summarization as language use including listening speaking reading writing standing and thinking
the basic characteristics of language use and understanding human minds can not directly access each other
humans create and use languages to realize interaction between minds
knowledge in minds evolves and self organizes through language use
the use of language relies on knowledge
the representation of knowledge is not unique and the understanding of representation is not unique
these characteristics lead to the following principles separation principle
the following three kinds of separations are involved in language structure grammar and semantics are separated
semantics can not be directly derived from structure
actually people do not rely on grammar to communicate with each other in daily life
knowledge for representation e

grammars and idioms and knowledge to be represented e

scientific knowledge are separated
representation and its summarization are separated
this leads to the separation of author meaning summarizer s understanding and readers understanding
the above separation principles lead to the natural obstacle of summarization
the problem of designing a suitable summarizer can be transformed into the problem of ing a suitable summarizer in cyberspace
the following are principles of selecting a suitable marizer
social selection principle
the suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers
knowledge selection is a kind of social selection
knowledge selection principle
the person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization
the above principle means that even people sharing the represented knowledge may not be the suitable person for summarizing the representation because they may not have the knowledge of representation
a friend of author may not be the suitable summarizer
the suitable person should have similar experience with the author including education work
through which knowledge is learned and shared
the following lemmas can be derived from the knowledge selection principle suitable summarizer
authors who commonly cited a representation are the candidates of suitable summarizers
this is because the represented knowledge was shared and the knowledge for representation is at the same level
authors are the best persons to summarize their own representations
this is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented
however authors have limited time and may be influenced by individual characteristics e

health and mood and worldview and social characteristics e

culture economy and influence
the evaluation of summarization follows some principles
relativity principle
satisfactory of summary is relative
a summary that satisfies one person may not satisfy the other
different persons can make different summaries for the same text and one person can generate different summaries for the same text at different times
this is because knowledge of different ple evolves personally
the inexact principle and the relativity principle indicate the following ciples moderate principle
a summary can be only moderately satisfied
the moderate principle indicates that the best summary does not exist
so the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant
dynamicity principle
the satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time
this is because knowledge interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society
openness principle
a satisfied summary can be reached only through an open social process of interactions and representations
the openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary
the above fundamental characteristics and principles indicate the following strategies for marization
summarization strategies
making use of the summaries of the persons who have rich social relations with the original thors
more types of links render more common knowledge and experience zhuge
this is because the establishment of rich social relations indicates common individual characteristics and social characteristics
adapting to readers interests
the interests of readers determine the selection of summaries
a good summarizer should know its potential readers
this requests a summarizer to collect and analyze readers interests according to their reading behaviors and attitudes to summaries
this is to pursuit a suitable summary rather than the best summary
making summarization through human machine interaction which can make full use of the vantages of both human and machines
it is the right way to pursue a satisfied summarization through a human machine symbiotic system licklider
enabling different summaries to cooperate and compete with each other for impact at multiple dimensions e

acceptance for reading and adoption for generating new summaries
ranking reviews to encourage contribution and competition among reviews reflect social value in a marization environment
different summaries may represent different characteristics of the summarizer
integrating individuals of diverse characteristics can cooperate with each other in making new summaries
transforming summarizations into the problem of searching suitable persons or summaries in the social networks of authors readers summarizers representations and links
enabling summarizers to know the background of representations including technological social and economic aspects

general citation definition measure and axiom citation is the basic element of a scientific paper
it enables readers to trace the origin and access relevant knowledge
it reflects the author s thinking comment innovation and summarization
it records the development track of science
generally citation is a kind of representation of selection and language use
exploring citation is a way to explore the nature of summarization
summarization is requested at the advanced stage of language development when the complex structure of representation emerges
citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text
therefore it is necessary to understand citation when studying summarization
explicit citation is often used in scientific papers and books in form of reference number or author year
a research area emerges and evolves through continual citing a set of papers on the same set of concepts through time
as shown in figure a new paper a denoting the title author abstract
becomes an often cited paper and then becomes a source paper when the area is ally formed
a survey paper summarizes an area through citing many papers in the area and it is often cited as it helps later researchers to quickly know this area
during the development of a search area different survey papers may appear at different development stages or on different facets afantenos et al
the later survey paper can benefit from the summaries of previous survey papers
citation and summarization are often involved in a reciprocity process novwak and mund
different from static text the citation network dynamically renders the source the formation and evolution of the area the backbone the impact of researchers and institutions potential knowledge flows through citation links zhuge and the networks of cooperation between researchers and between institutions with the evolution of the area
summaries of different scales can be obtained through zoom in and zoom out on the citation network
it is feasible to transform a citation work into a text by using some language patterns for example the idea of a was extended by b the idea of a was used by b and the idea of a inspired b to represent different citations main roles relations and development track
hyperlink of the web is a kind of explicit citation that freely complements explains or extends the content of the current web pages
homepage like yahoo is the summarization of its web pages
different from scientific papers webpages can be changed and links can be also changed so the hyperlink network of webpages evolve notably
an advanced faceted navigator provides ti facet summarization of the contents in a website for users xu and zhuge
cite a cite cite a cite a area bk bk cite cp citing summarizing time evolving figure
an area emerges when new papers often cite some old papers
the citation network evolves with partially summarizing an area and rendering topics important roles relations and velopment track
implicit citation is used in free texts and literature works
some implicit citations have mark words such as someone says and according to someone s opinion
these implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers
some implicit citations just reuse others sentences or clauses without any mark word
for example the sentence it s greek to me appeared in text implicitly cite the scenario used in in shakespeare play julius caesar and into thin air cites the book written by jon krakauer lished in and many other earlier works
transforming implicit citations needs to compare common clauses in works published in different times
citation is a kind of representation by individual selection and language use
summarizing ous citations can reach a notion of general citation
definition general citation
citation is an individual selection of relevant representations for plaining evidencing complementing commenting or revising a representation either explicitly or implicitly according to individual motivation and knowledge
diverse individual selections evolve the citation network
citations form the intention and extension of a representation
the extension of representation a consists of all representations that cite a and are cited by a
if representation a cites a set of representations b then b constitutes an extension of a
if tion a cites a set of representations b and a is cited by a set of representations c then both b and c constitute the extension of a
the core representation renders the core idea of a representation
a good article renders just one core
the core representation of a scientific paper is rendered by its keywords title abstract and conclusion
the representation that has a direct link to the core representation is close core sentation
for example two paragraphs sharing some words are linked by these common words
representations linked to the close core representations are relevant to core representation
other representations are peripheral representations
the intention of representation is indicated by core representations and by citation from other representations
the intention of representation p is indicated by the core of p sisting of the core representations of p and the representations that cite
a core representation has a high rank in the citation network
it is usually emphasized in various ways to attract attention
for scientific papers a core representation reflects motivation problem or solution
the intention of a representation is rendered by commonsense which is indicated by the basic representations
in natural language commonsense is indicated by distinctive words and oms
some scientists tried to codify many commonsense to enable computers to have artificial ligence beyond algorithm lenat

a core representation takes the priority of emerging when reading
in scientific papers the core representations usually appear in the front and in the end e

title abstract and conclusion so that readers can be impressed before and after reading the main body
this helps enhance the memory of the core by focusing and refocusing on the core when building or retrieving the semantic images in the mental space
humans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times so we have the following axiom
axiom additive axiom
a representation can be composed by a set of representations
this axiom is the basis of representation including using languages and summarization cially for multi document summarization
therefore a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations p p p p p p which represents a recursive structure of an abstraction p p an union p p and a set of representations p p
figure depicts the extension and the intention rendered by citations
cite representation in entific papers is rendered by the paragraph or the sentence that includes the cite mark commonly used in a community
extension intension cite cite figure
extension and intention rendered by citation
dictionaries explain words in texts so they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts
from this point of view any text has a set of basic citations
so the above statement is ble for text
the basic behaviors of summarization include emerging selecting citing explicitly or implicitly and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation
text summarization is a special case of summarization
definition summarization as citation
the summarization s of a set of representations p is dered by its intention and extension as follows where is the summarization of the intention of p is the summarization of the intention and extension of p pp means that p cites p m denotes the set of cite representations in pi that cites p and describes p from the view of the author of pi

n pp
qi ojp i n pp
different from previous notions of summarization this definition gives the minimum summary the summary of the intention and the maximum summary the summary of the intention and the extension of a representation and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization

dimension of representation
dimensions of structuring summary structuring summary in an appropriate form is important as summary is mainly for human to read and understand
an appropriate form concerns the innovative cyber display based on human mental structure psychological structure and innovative display
the following are some dimensions for organizing a summary
time
organizing representations in time order or reverse time order
time order is in line with human innate sense of time and the process of reading
author
the original structure of the core representations takes the priority to appear in summary
the reason is that authors are the best person to organize his representation
authors can have their own styles patterns in organizing representations
core
features such as location front size and color render a core representation
the core representations in one representation e

text render its topic
relevant representations are arranged at the places closed to the core representation
this priority arranges relevant representations distributed in the original representation at the places close to the core resentations in the summary
this is a phenomenon of semantic locality zhuge
for a set of closely relevant representations the order of organizing representations in a summary should consider the formation process of the set which reflects certain semantics of the set
citation between scientific papers reflects such an order which should be considered in multi document summarization
the linear order of traditional text representations is in line with human physiological istics and innate sense of time
it is unclear so far how human mind organize knowledge
to reflect not only reading characteristics but also understanding characteristics it is a reasonable method to combine the linear organization with the order of generalization and specialization
further we can consider organize representations with a multi dimensional classification space
a dimension like topic can organize coordinates as a tree representing multi level generalization and specialization
sub dimensions can be arranged according to the measure of relevance between ordinates
figure shows a three dimensional space for organizing representations through time dimension author dimension and topic dimension
it enables readers to know the topic movement of a particular author or a group of authors through time
it also enables readers to know the role of author such as the source and the novice during the development of a topic at certain time
the ti dimensional organization can provide multiple threads for readers to browse as indicated by the two way arrows generalization and specialization threads through a topic tree
time threads within a topic
topic relevancy threads within a period at the time dimension
the evolution of topics in the area through the time dimension
humans experience in a multi dimensional space but have to use a two dimensional media such as paper and screen to externalize representation
information loses through transformation from the internal representation to the form of display
inventing a new interface that can easily convey resentations through multiple channels is a way to improve human understanding
topic subtopic subtopic a zhuge z time author figure
a three dimensional space for organizing representations
the two way arrows represent possible browse threads through the dimensions of time topic and author
a multi dimensional space can be represented in different forms zhuge
figure shows a space with four dimensions topic region time and author each of which is defined by a tree ture
every point in the space has one projection at every dimension a node in the tree
moving from one point to the other point changes the projections at every dimension
this form of tation can represent a space of any number of dimensions
this form of representation looks similar to the wind rose plot which can efficiently convey the meaning of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a location
the difference is that the win rose plot specifies the uniform value speed while a point in the multi dimensional space can have different types of values projections at different dimensions
topic time figure
a display form of multi dimensional space

summarization on demand summarization carries out in an interaction environment where people read write cite and municate with personal spaces
the personal spaces reflect personal reading experience interests and knowledge based on the texts that have been read
a summarization can be satisfied only when it matches the personal space of the reader
the general process of summarization on demand is shown in figure
the summarization tem is responsible for classifying linking and reorganizing representations
the function ing linking classifies representations according to the given dimensions connects representations by discovering implicit relations transforming implicit relations into explicit relations discovering communities and identifying appropriate representations
users can adapt the dimensions to ate new summaries and to add summaries to the system for composition and comparison
citation links between summaries and source representations help analysis and reuse
the information eling provides the appropriate models for processing and organizing representations
the knowledge provides the rules of representation and understanding
the summarization strategies support the processing of representations under uncertain conditions
the arrows in red color denote the following transformations transform representations including citation structure into a multi dimensional tion space denoted as a in figure by classifying and linking representations
transform a point or a subspace of a into a point or a subspace in the user personal spaces denoted as b c and d which are also multi dimensional classification spaces that represent users interests and personalities
region author citations citations classifying linking citation structure a define personal space adapt personal space contribute summaries event summary time location b on demand c d summarization knowledge information modeling strategies figure
summarization on demand

forms previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as ers assume that the form of output is the same as the input
however the form of summary cantly influences the understandability of summary
interface innovation enables users to easily derstand a summary
the following are possible forms of interface simple structure
simple structures such as list tree and grid have been widely used to marize representations in daily life e

displaying table of contents family trees tion structures and properties on map
different structures are suitable for different tions
hypertext
a summary can be in form of a hypertext where some texts are summarized as a hyperlink and some texts containing hyperlinks are summarized as a hyperlink at the higher level
the advantage is that the content is the same as the original text and readers can read the concise top level content first and then read the details by clicking the link if they are interested in
the following steps implement this a give the expected size of summary and interest
rank the paragraphs of the text according to the interest
c shrink the low rank paragraphs as hyperlinks
do if the size of the text is greater than expected otherwise end
automatic link generation was studied in hypertext area salton al
an interactive visual text analysis tool can help readers understand the summary liu et al

semantic link network
a graph with meaningful nodes and links can clearly summarize the main concepts and cues within zhuge
a semantic link network of important concepts and relations can help readers quickly know the main cues and measures in representations
the key is how to extract appropriate nodes and links from tions
different from linear reading a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately
the semantic link network can be regarded as the map of the cyberspace and social space
semantic link network can be regarded as the extension of the semantic net quillian and tional nets ceccato which represents the relations between concepts
multimedia
coordinating texts pictures and videos can render a summary from different channels of sense
it is particularly useful in making slides or posters for scientific research according to papers and summarizing historical and literature works
a semantic link network is a way to organize multimedia
emerging
this function is to emerge pictures or video clips relevant to the important sentations in viewing scope while displaying
an eye tracking mechanism can help matically locate the scope
evaluation is needed to ensure the effectiveness of reading
new devices
new interface devices like monitor will significantly influence the sentation of summary
optimizing the layout of display needs to consider three dimensions
printer extends display from cyberspace to the physical space
printer will further extend display to the formation of the objects sensed from more dimensions
the advanced summarizer could create new objects that can be seen touched smelled heard and even tasted
people could hold what they think and write
the new interfaces provide a new cognitive environment for humans
enabling the form to accurately convey the core meaning of what is to be represented is the key

multi dimensional evaluation previous evaluation methods focus on summary which is just one dimension of summarization and it is not reasonable to pursuit the best summary
the reasonable method is to study the multiple dimensions of the summarization environment and to consider the reasonable result
summarization is involved in individual and social construction processes so it concerns ple dimensions
the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding indicate the following dimensions for evaluating a summarization reader
it includes the following sub dimensions interest
a summary should match the interests of readers
sometimes readers only need one aspect of a representation
readers comments and previous reading iors e

the often clicked hyperlinks reflect interests
b cognitive level
a summary should match the reader s cognitive level
therefore concepts at the reader s cognitive level should be selected
author
a summarizer can understand the input representation better if it knows more about the author including the relevant articles and social networks
input
input should also be evaluated because some representations are unnecessary for summarization
on one hand a very simple and short representation such as a short graph of text and a picture is unnecessary for summarization as they can be quickly stood
on the other hand the input should match readers interest first
summarizer
a openness
the closed systems designed by particular persons are unable to make satisfied summarization because only the persons sharing knowledge with the writer can make isfied summarization
adaptability
a summarization system should be improvable during use and be able to adapt to readers updates and adapt to new representations especially on the same topic
interactivity
this also implies that a summarizer should be able to interact with readers so that it can select the appropriate representations e

sentences and use the tions that the reader is familiar with
further it should interact with other people ing authors to get more concepts and rules and with the systems to get more information
output summary
it includes the following sub dimensions core representation
the core representations and the relations between them should be reserved in summary
b coherence
coherence between representations e

sentences can increase readablitiy brandow et al regina barzilay and mirella lapata
completeness
a summary should be self complete all core representations that match reader s interest should be included
usage
it includes the number of people who have used the summary and their attitudes

incorporating pictures into summary it is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations
many applications have incorporated pictures into maries e

transforming a paper into slides or a poster transforming a novel into a carton book and creating a webpage according to a set of texts and pictures
there could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected cording to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences according to the semantic locality principle zhuge
the summary with pictures is more attractive than the text only summary
a picture can convey meaning in about seconds due to its familiarity and complexity to the viewer
in contrast ers need to scan the whole text to know the text only summary
the reading order of the two summaries is different
pictures take the priority in conveying meaning while reading the summary with pictures
the following are two kinds of reading order browse all the pictures read the text beside each picture and view a picture read beside text view last picture read beside text
pictures and texts may be viewed again but pictures still take priority during reviewing
further the two types of summaries have different memory effects
the summary incorporating pictures can enhance reader s short term and long term memory
an explanation is that the summary with pictures gives readers stronger impression and provides more dimensions for rendering meaning and establishes more links to render meaning
a picture reflects a view of the physical space while natural language indicates a semantic image in mind
a summary rendered by both pictures and natural language provides more indicators for readers to build semantic images
for extractive text summarization to keep consistency between sentences can enhance ity
one advantage of incorporating pictures into summary is that pictures provide a different bridge between language units e

sentences especially when connection sentence can not be found in original text
for example the picture with tags a and e

hotel and garden indicating a ture of hotel with nice garden can bridge the sentence containing a e

garden indicating it is a beautiful garden and the sentence containing e

hotel indicating the hotel is near the sea
this new bridge can enhance the readability of a summary
new generation search engines have integrated pictures the summaries of texts and hyperlinks in their formatted search results which provides richer content for users than the link list provided by old search engines
however a pre designed format can not adapt to user requirements
the following are some problems and strategies
how to select appropriate pictures humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they perience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind
however machines need to rely on human instruction to process pictures
the web
provides the platform for people to upload and tag pictures on the web
the semantic link networks of texts pictures tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for tion
so building the networks is the key to solve the problem
from the evolution construction and social construction point of views zhuge tags might have been used in some texts by people
language representations like tags indicate the usage of the pictures
existing proaches such as feature based approaches and machine learning approaches can be used to classify pictures
image retrieval techniques can help find candidate pictures gudivada and raghavan
how to organize pictures and texts a use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text to rize the rest representation and to organize the summary according to the original ture
select and use pictures to replace the texts in summary
select and insert pictures into summary at appropriate places
d classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary
construct a semantic link network of pictures tags and language representations in vant texts as the summary
a semantic link can be regarded as a citation that cally connects two things zhuge
how to identify events in pictures and link them to appropriate texts the strategy is to make use of sensors and create semantic links between pictures and texts by detecting common projections at physical and social dimensions
current smart cameras e

smart phones can record the time and physical location of taking photos which are the projections of pictures on the time dimension and the location dimension
the photos are probably relevant to the events happened at the same time and location
using pictures to summarize text is a new direction of summarizing text
empirical research has been done in this direction zhu uzzaman agrawal
research can lead to a new form of summary that can increase readability and understandability
online picture sharing systems like flicker provide rich picture resources for implementing this idea
as new pictures are continually added to the online systems a good summarization system should be able to keep up to date pictures in summarization
figure depicts the idea of constructing a semantic link network of pictures and tags as a mary
the core words such as hotel golf and garden can be identified by comparing the source text and tags
then the relations like back of relying on the core words can be identified
so the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval gudivada and raghavan
further pictures can be extended to the snapshots of videos
different from image retrieval e

search images according to words the picture based summarization approach has a ground of texts a network of source texts or summaries when searching the picture text repository
topic requirement hotelof hotelof backof backof in in hawaii in in hotel usa
hawaii location usa
hawaii location source text last year to present a paper i attended held in hawaii united state of american
i lived in a small but very beautiful hotel
in front of the hotel there is a beautiful golf course surrounded by trees
i can often see rainbows after raining
the back of the hotel is a beautiful garden which closes to the sea
i can see the sea from the windows of my room
usa hawaii new york location hotel golf rainbow trees garden sea beauty figure
a summarization system consisting of a multi dimensional classification space of mary in form of semantic link network of pictures and language representations and a requirement space defined and managed by users
web pictures tags activities upload topic time scene the generated summary is not unique as the tag sets of different pictures may be overlapped
isting summaries can be put into the space and linked to the tag set
in this way the existing maries can be reused when making new summarizations
it is important to ensure that the generated network of symbols and images should be small to cilitate understanding
according to the efficiency principle and regional principle the radius of the network should be small
the radius can be defined as the maximum length of link chain from the center determined by core nodes to any node
in real application a summarization system should enable readers to adjust the radius according to requirement
incorporating pictures into a summary enables a summarizer to summarize events
events can be classified into points in a complex space with the following dimensions time
dimensions evolve with time
different types of events may have different tions at the time dimension
communication network
volved in different events
location
an event happens at a physical location which can be captured by gps ip or people
different classes of people play different roles in society and thus are likely category
the category hierarchy of events
representation
it usually includes some sub dimensions feature representation pattern representation language representation including text voice and movie and function representation different objects such as car mobile phone house and road have different functions
summarizing videos graphs and pictures
summarizing videos automatic video summarization is to enable machines to generate a clip of a long video or a set of long videos
it is important in video management retrieval and browsing
it becomes more and more important with wide use of digital cameras in our society for security news entertainment education advertisements
humans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday
automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes
there are two fundamental classes of video summarization focusing on still picture static storyboard a small collection of salient images extracted from video sources and focusing on moving pictures moving storyboard a collection of image sequences and the corresponding audio abstract extracted from the original sequence which results in a short video clip
summarizing a video requires machines to identify the essential characteristics of the video
video summarization concerns the simplification of motion
a video sequence can be represented as trajectory curves in a high dimensional feature space which can be decomposed into curve segments of low dimension for simplification dementhon et al

the patterns of events conversations and behaviors should be characterized to get semantically meaningful summaries of complicated video contents tewfik
low level features such as color boundary and shot classification can help summarize videos
for particular applications like football games ekin important sections such as slow motion segments and goals in game are known by humans so it is easy to find the important sections
some criteria such as coverage the summary should represent the original one and diversity the elements of the summary should be distinct from each other were proposed shroff
some approaches focus on some contents about who what where and when in the framework of the video contents to produce a concept level summary chen
existing search is generally empirical and focuses on particular applications
modern movies provide more channels e

voice and music for understanding than early silent movies
current online movies contain subtitles which provide a new condition for making rization of videos through natural language processing
these subtitles provide the basis for ating a piece of text as the summary of movies
a semantics based approach to summarizing videos is to construct a semantic structure on videos by introducing semantic links into videos
the higher abstraction level of the structure presents re general summary of the video
a semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest e

the tic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development
to realize more meaningful video summarization it is important to represent body language spoken language emotion habit and psychological activities in microscopic
behavior recognition is the basic components of understanding videos
in macroscopic it is important to represent the background of the video and relevant social structure interests fashion rules regulations laws and culture of society in a summarization system
these concern in depth understanding of the basic teraction principles in the complex space consisting of cyberspace social space and physical space

summarizing graphs graphs are the generalization of various real networks in cyberspace e

data structures ical space e

supply chains material flow networks and social space e

social networks of things
summarizing data structures can provide more general data services
the summarization of tional database takes table as input and produces a reduced version of the table through rewriting and generalization
the resulting table is expected to provide tuples with less precision than the original but more informative saint paul
summarizing data streams supports more general mental queries on data streams such as point range and inner product queries g
cormode and s
muthukrishnan
fuzzy set was used to summarize data structures yager g
raschia and n
mouaddib
the resource space model supports multi dimensional generalization and specialization zhuge
transformation between different data structures can help summarization zhuge
a unified representation such as xml extensible markup guage and owl web ontology language helps transformation and unify summarization
summarization can help humans understand large scale graphs
summarizing a large scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data navlakha tian
an interactive graph summarization approach was proposed zhang
tistics is a useful means for machines to summarize graphs
network analysis techniques such as degree distribution and community discovery can be used to find more important part and the archy of a graph
in some areas like cad graph components have formal specifications
making abstraction on graph components can be done through mathematical derivation
so summarization in these areas has the reasons of summarization and the correctness guarantee of using summaries
if we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network zhuge where nodes and edges can be texts pictures and videos

summarizing pictures the main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest
there have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures with the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years due to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones
the summarization of pictures also helps incorporate propriate pictures into the summary as discussed before
humans can make a humanized summarization because they have experience and knowledge out of pictures
it is hard to enable machines to make a humanized summarization
discovering the mantic link networks that the pictures involved in can help automatic summarization
automatic summarization of pictures can be extended to include the solutions to the following issues generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures
a solution is to transform this issue into an information retrieval and text summarization issue select the representative tags of these pictures search relevant texts according to these tags or select the texts that contain or link to these pictures and then summarize these texts
another way is to establish basic mantic links between pictures find the best matched text and make necessary text zation
the establishment of the semantic links relies on the relations between their tags termined by existing texts and links and the categories of pictures
selecting one picture to represent a set of related pictures
a solution is to transform this issue into a text summarization issue transform pictures into texts according to the way scribed in summarize the texts and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary
generating a small network of pictures from a large set of related pictures
a solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures select one picture to represent one community and construct a network of the representative pictures
generating a small network of texts according to a large set of pictures
a solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures to select one text to resent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community and to struct a semantic link network of the representative texts
a solution to implement this idea is to make use of existing summaries made by humans and the corresponding pictures in the networks of pictures tags summaries source texts and people who involved in forming and using these things
the key problem is to select a better picture from the candidates that have the same projections on the dimensions of time location and topic because the semantic links between pictures may be poor
for example it is hard to automatically find the abstraction relationship between pictures
modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions language feature time and location
the problem of summarizing texts pictures and videos can be generalized as one problem
the relations between texts between pictures and between videos can be mutually enforced explained and rendered
the form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts pictures audios and videos

general summarization
unification humans have been pursuing the ways to represent thoughts behaviors artifacts and the nature
various devices and approaches have been invented and developed to represent and process different forms such as natural languages pictures videos and graphs
various representations constitute a representation space with particular structure and operations
summarization is a kind of operation that inputs one or more representations in this space and then outputs a new representation
let s recall how human process representations generated through different channels
people ve the following common experience scanning the symbols in a novel generates some images in mind and the images emerge before symbols when recall
similar images will be generated when seeing the movie about the novel
a distinguished characteristic is that humans generate behaviors including mental behaviors different from the input
this indicates that human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level
this indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts pictures videos and graphs
cognitive psychologists argue that people usually remember meaning rather than exact tation and that meaning represents through the perceptual and motor systems for interacting with the world
the categorical organization of knowledge strongly influences the way to encode and member experiences anderson
this is the psychological basis of classification
humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are ated
to facilitate communication humans indicate the mental semantic images in the language commonly used in society but it is hard to communicate in the form of what they have seen or felt
a semantic image can be an image like form when representing daily life or a symbol like form when representing abstract concepts
discovering unity in diversity is a scientific research method which has generated many portant scientific principles and theories for example maxwell successfully unified electricity and magnetism
however unifying different theories is hard because it needs to uncover the common nature behind existing theories and different theories may represent different aspects of a domain and use different representation systems that are difficult to be unified
sometimes pursuing unity is an adventure like the pursuit of a unified field theory
knowledge representation approaches such as the production rule davis al the frame minsky and the semantic net quillian are symbol systems that can carry out ing for solving problems
a unified representation should reflect the most fundamental tics of concerned representations
the unified modeling language uml uniformly represented business processes and behaviors software architectures processes and behaviors and data tures
establishing a unified representation enables a summarization system to uniformly process ous representations
a transformational development of the fundamental infrastructure of space e

a new generation computer and smarter devices will influence the generation of new representations

transformation with dimension reduction a text can be transformed into a semantic link network of words sentences and paragraphs
one semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor
a video can also be transformed into a semantic link network of video clips
links between words in subtitles and video clips can be established
links between videos are enriched through the mediation of words
for the videos with scripts words will play more important role in representing videos
in addition voice and music can render the link between videos
a unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts os pictures and graphs into semantic link networks
a complex semantic link network of different forms enables one form e

movies to link to other forms e

novel script pictures of actors and actress posters comments related movie
the form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts videos audios pictures and graphs which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie
appropriate coordination between different forms concerns humanity and sociology
the size of summary depends on user requirement and cognitive level
cyberspace consists of huge links among texts videos audios pictures and graphs sponding to human senses and the structures of cyberspace physical space and social space
any text video audio picture or graph does not exist independently has explicit or implicit links to other form of representations
one form of representation like text usually links to other forms of sentation like pictures and possibly to video audio and graph which can be regarded as citation for explanation complementation or extension
the network evolved with social interactions mines different summaries at different times
transformation between representations is a way to realize unification
it inputs one form of representation and outputs another form of representation
summarization is a special mation that operates dimension reduction for easier understanding
from this point of view rization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space
therefore we have the following definition
definition multi dimensional summarization
multi dimensional summarization is a tion dm dj which transforms a representation dm pm in the source space of representations p with dimensions and dm into a representation ti pj in the target space of representations t with dimensions and such that t contains the core of p at dimensions di and dj
the dimensions of p vary with different sources and the dimensions of t vary with the readers of the summary
some relations may exist between dimensions
usually t has a small number of mensions
the scale of summary can be regarded as a dimension
the reason is that a reader can easily and quickly understand the summary if the dimension of the target space is the same as the dimension of the reader s personal space which represents the reader s mind cognitive ture
the definition of summarization based on citation given in section gives the range of t and dj reflects the basic cognitive level of reader

cognitive level cognitive psychologists have been exploring mental concepts through rational definition prototype exemplar and knowledge studies
they try to find the basic cognitive level in the concept hierarchy shared by people murphy
however different communities can have different cognitive levels
the basic cognitive level can be established for the hierarchy of universal concepts
the cyberspace including the wikipedia is reflecting more and more of the hierarchy of the universal concepts
the cognitive hierarchy of different communities corresponds to different sub graphs of the hierarchy and has different basic cognitive levels
the cognitive level for a particular research field can be reflected by all of its papers
it stands for the basic cognitive level of all the authors in the field
relevant research concerns commonsense knowledge level and abstraction newell minsky tenenbaum
physical instruments such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and electroencephalography egg have been used to detect the physical status of mind turkeltaub
the relations between language and brain have attracted many researchers friederici bates and dick
a summary is suitable if its cognitive level is the same as the reader s cognitive level
the following are some rules to make a suitable summary if the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader s cognitive level the summary should use the core representations in the original representation
if the cognitive level of the original representation is higher than the reader s cognitive level the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy
if the cognitive level of the original representation is lower than the reader s cognitive level the summary should use more general concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy

representation lattice in psychology representation is a kind of hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents ternal reality
externalization of the internal representation involves in complex mental physical and social behaviors
ontology helps establish a general representation from the nature of the world knowledge and knowing
from the pragmatism point of view ontology was developed by it fessionals for information sharing gruber ashburner
ontology helps explain sentation and establish the links between representations
this enables summarization systems to use more general or specific concepts in summary
representations can be generalized united classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in figure
a cognitive level determines a representation lattice
operations on representations enrich the structure of the lattice
abstraction and analogy are the important operations of generating representations zhuge
the abstract representation reflects the common characteristics of a set of different types of cerned representations
abstract representation is particularly useful for developing theories
ematical tools such as logic algebra and graph can help develop abstract representations
however over abstract representation may not be useful in real applications
abstract representation generalization cognitive level representations semantic link network classification union ontology figure
representation lattice at certain cognitive level
the union of representations integrates different representations to provide a global view of these representations
it is important to ensure the understandability and expressiveness of the integrated representation
as a kind of union data integration enables users to get a global view of data ated from different sources friedman al lenzerini halevy et al
the union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space
a complex space incorporating multi dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images
different representations of the same thing can be linked to the same semantic image for understanding and thinking zhuge
the general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation

conclusion summarization is an open representation of representation in diverse forms from multiple mensions and through interactions in multiple spaces
the basic interactions include selecting ing and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation
texts have been the major means to reflect the evolution of human society
it is necessary to explore automatic summarization of texts expanding rapidly in cyberspace
however existing proaches are empirical mainly relying on statistics structure and linguistic analysis while neglecting the nature of representation and understanding
this paper summarizes previous approaches and explores the fundamental theory and method for summarization from multiple dimensions
the core viewpoint is that summarization is carried out with various interactions involved in human machine and various representations including text picture and video
writers and readers represent mainly through explicit or implicit citations
studying the summarization of pictures videos and graphs reaches a general summarization method
it is hard for automatic summarization systems to realize human level summarization as it cerns the essential natural and social differences between human and the systems
putting rization into a human machine nature symbiotic network is a way to make a breakthrough
a icant progress of summarization research relies on an innovative summarization of philosophy chology linguistics cognitive science neuroscience physics computer science and artificial ligence from multiple dimensions
this work is an attempt to help broaden the scope of summarization research and inspire cross disciplinary research to develop this area
