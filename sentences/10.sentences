com into abstract text summarization can be classified two approaches extraction and abstraction
this paper focuses on extraction approach
the goal of text summarization based on extraction approach is sentence selection
one of the methods to obtain the suitable sentences is to assign some numerical measure of a sentence for the summary called sentence weighting and then select the best ones
the first step in summarization by extraction is the identification of important features
in our experiment we used test documents in data set
each document is prepared by preprocessing process sentence segmentation tokenization removing stop word and word stemming
then we used important features and calculate their score for each sentence
we proposed text summarization based on fuzzy logic to improve the quality of the summary created by the general statistic method
we compared our results with the baseline summarizer and microsoft word summarizers
the results show that the best average precision recall and measure for the summaries were obtained by fuzzy method
fuzzy logic sentence feature text summarization i
introduction an increasingly important task in the current era of information overload text summarization has become an important and timely tool for helping and interpreting the large volumes of text available in documents
the goal of text summarization is to present the most important information in a shorter version of the original text while keeping its main content and helps the user to quickly understand large volumes of information
text summarization addresses both the problem of selecting the most important sections of text and the problem of generating coherent summaries
this process is significantly different from that of human based text summarization since human can capture and relate deep meanings and themes of text documents while automation of such a skill is very difficult to implement
automatic text summarization researchers since luhn work they are trying to solve or at least relieve that problem by proposing the summaries serve as quick guide to interesting information providing a short form for each document in the document set reading summary makes decision about reading the whole document or not it also serves as time saver
a number of researchers have proposed techniques for automatic text techniques for generating summaries
suan dusit rajabhat university and universiti teknologi malaysia
summarization which can be classified into two categories extraction and abstraction
extraction summary is a selection of sentences or phrases from the original text with the highest score and put it together to a new shorter text without changing the source text
abstraction summary method uses linguistic methods to examine and interpret the text
most of the current automated text summarization system use extraction method to produce summary
automatic text summarization works best on well structured documents such as news reports articles and scientific papers
the first step in summarization by extraction is the identification of important features such as sentence length sentence location term frequency number of words occurring in title number of proper nouns and number of numerical data
in our approach we utilize a feature fusion technique to discover which features out of the available ones are most useful
in this paper we propose text summarization based on fuzzy logic method to extract important sentences as a summary
the rest of this paper is organized as follows
section ii presents the summarization approach
section iii describes preprocessing and the important features
section iv and v describes our proposed followed by experimental design experimental results and evaluation
finally we conclude and suggest future work that can be carried out in section vi
ii
summarization approaches in early classic summarization system the important summaries were created according to the most frequent words in the text
luhn created the first summarization system in
rath et al
in proposed empirical evidences for difficulties inherent in the notion of ideal summary
both studies used thematic features such as term frequency thus they are characterized by surface level approaches
in the early new approaches called entity level approaches appeared the first approach of this kind used syntactic analysis
the location features were used in where key phrases are used dealt with three additional components pragmatic words cue words i
e
words would have positive or negative effect on the respective sentence weight like significant key idea or hardly title and heading words and structural indicators sentence location where the sentences appearing in initial or final of text unit are more significant to include in the summary
in statistical method was described by using a bayesian classifier to compute the probability that a sentence in a source document should be included in a summary
proposed a and domain independent based method for single document extractive summarization
they shown that maximal frequent sequences as well as single words that are part of bigrams repeated more than once in the text are good terms to describe documents
powerful reasoning in this paper we propose important sentence extraction using fuzzy rules and fuzzy set for selecting sentences based on their features
fuzzy logic techniques in the form of approximate reasoning provide decision support and expert systems with capabilities
the permissiveness of fuzziness in human thought processes suggests that much of the logic behind human reasoning is not only a traditional two values or multi valued logic but also logic with fuzzy truths fuzzy connectives and fuzzy rules of inference
fuzzy set proposed by zadeh is a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty imprecision vagueness and ambiguity
fuzzy logic in text summarization needs more investigation
a few studies were done in this area witte and bergler presented a fuzzy theory based approach to co reference resolution and its application to text summarization
automatic determination of co reference between noun phrases is fraught with uncertainty
kiani and akbarzadeh proposed technique for summarizing text using combination of genetic algorithm ga and genetic programming gp to optimize rule sets and membership function of fuzzy systems
the feature extraction techniques are used to obtain the important sentences in the text
for instance luhn looked at the frequency of word distributions should imply the most important concepts of the document
some of features are used in this research such as sentence length
some sentences are short or some sentences are long
what is clear is that some of the attributes have more importance and some have less so they should have balance weight in computations and we use fuzzy logic to solve this problem by defining the membership functions for each feature
iii
extraction of features a
data set and preprocessing we used documents from to create automatic single document summarization
each document consists of to sentences with an average of sentences
the collection provided
each document in collection is supplied with a set of generation summaries provided by two different experts
while each expert was asked to generate summaries of different length we use only generic word variants
currently input document are of plain text format
there are four main activities performed in this stage sentence segmentation tokenization removing stop word and word stemming
sentence segmentation is boundary detection and text into sentence
tokenization ijcsis international journal of computer science and information security vol
no
separating source is separating the input document into individual words
next removing stop words stop words are the words which appear frequently in document but provide less meaning in identifying the important content of the document such as a an the

the last step for preprocessing is word stemming word stemming is the process of removing prefixes and suffixes of each word
b
sentence features after this preprocessing each sentence of the document is represented by an attribute vector of features
these features are attributes that attempt to represent the data used for their task
we focus on eight features for each sentence
each feature is given a value between and
there are eight features as follows title feature the word in sentence that also occurs in title gives high score
this is determined by counting the number of matches between the content words in a sentence and the words in the title
we calculate the score for this feature which is the ratio of the number of words in the sentence that occur in the title over the number of words in title
no
title word in s no
word in title sentence length this feature is useful to filter out short sentences such as datelines and author names commonly found in news articles
the short sentences are not expected to belong to the summary
we use the length of the sentence which is the ratio of the number of words occurring in the sentence over the number of words occurring in the longest sentence of the document
no
word occurring in s no
word occurring in longest sentence term weight the frequency of term occurrences within a document has often been used for calculating the importance of sentence
the score of a sentence can be calculated as the sum of the score of words in the sentence
the score of important score wi of word i can be calculated by the traditional tf
idf method as follows
we applied this method to tf
isf term frequency inverse sentence frequency
where tfi is the tern frequency of word i in the document n is the total number of sentences and ni is number of sentences in which word i occurs
this feature can be calculated as follows
k is number of words in sentence
sentence position whether it is the first sentences in the paragraph sentence position in text gives the importance of the sentences
this feature can involve several items such as the position of a sentence in the document section and paragraph
proposed the first sentence is highest ranking
the score for this feature we consider the first sentences in the paragraph
this feature score is calculated as the following equation
for for for for for for other sentences sentence to sentence similarity this feature is a similarity between sentences
for each sentence s the similarity between s and each other sentence is computed by the cosine similarity measure with a resulting value between and
the term weight wi and of term t to n term in sentence si and sj are represented as the vectors
the similarity of each sentence pair is calculated based on similarity formula
the score of this feature for a sentence s is obtained by computing the ratio of the summary of sentence similarity of sentence s with each other sentence over the maximum of summary proper noun the sentence that contains more proper nouns name entity is an important and it is most probably included in the document summary
the score for this feature is calculated as the ratio of the number of proper nouns that occur in sentence over the sentence length
no
proper nouns in s sentence length s thematic word the number of thematic word in sentence this feature is important because terms that occur frequently in a document are probably related to topic
the number of thematic words indicates the words with maximum possible relativity
we used the top most frequent content word for consideration as thematic
the score for this feature is calculated as the ratio of the number of thematic words that occur in the sentence over the maximum summary of thematic words in the sentence
no
thematic word in s
thematic word numerical data ijcsis international journal of computer science and information security vol
no
the number of numerical data in sentence sentence that contains numerical data is important and it is most probably included in the document summary
the score for this feature is calculated as the ratio of the number of numerical data that occur in sentence over the sentence length
no
numerical data in s sentence length s iv
the methods to extract the goal of text summarization based on extraction approach is sentence selection
one of the methods to obtain the suitable sentences is to assign some numerical measure of a sentence for the summary called sentence weighting and then select the best ones
therefore the features score of each sentence that we described in the previous section are used to obtain the significant sentences
in this section we use two methods text the summarization based on general statistic method gsm and fuzzy logic method
the system consists of the following main steps read the source document into the system for preprocessing step the system extracts the individual sentences of the original documents
then separate the input document into individual words
next remove stop words
the last step for preprocessing is word stemming each sentence is associated with vector of eight features that described in section iii whose values are derived from the content of the sentence important sentences the features are calculated to obtain the sentence score base on general statistic method gsm shows in figure
and fuzzy logic method shows in figure
a set of highest score sentences are extracted as document summary based on the compression rate

text summarization based on general statistic method gsm architecture text summarization base on general statistic method is produced by the sentence weighting
first for a sentence s a weighted score function as shown in the following equation is exploited to integrate all the eight feature scores mentioned in section iii the score of the sentence s the score of the feature b
text summarization based on fuzzy logic fuzzy logic system design usually implicates selecting fuzzy rules and membership function
the selection of fuzzy rules and membership the performance of the fuzzy logic system
functions directly affect the the fuzzy logic system consists of four components fuzzifier fuzzy inference engine defuzzifier and knowledge base
in the fuzzifier crisp inputs are translated into linguistic values using a membership function to be used to the input linguistic variables
after fuzzification the inference engine refers to the rule base containing fuzzy then rules to derive the linguistic values
in the last step the output linguistic variables from the inference are converted to the final crisp values by the defuzzifier using membership function for representing the final sentence score
fuzzifier features score fuzzy input source document inference engine fuzzy output fuzzify rule base defuzzifier sentence score extraction of sentences summary document preprocessing extraction of features figure
text summarization based on fuzzy logic system architecture in order to implement text summarization based on fuzzy logic first the eight features extracted in the previous section are used as input to the fuzzifier
we used triangular membership functions and fuzzy logic to summarize the ijcsis international journal of computer science and information security vol
no
document
the input membership function for each feature is divided into five fuzzy set which are composed of unimportant values low l and very low vl median m and important values high h and very high vh
the generalized triangular membership function depends on three parameters a b and c as given by
a value from zero to one is obtained for each sentence in the output based on sentence features and the available rules in the knowledge base
the obtained value in the output determines the degree of importance of the sentence in the final summary
the parameters a and set the left and right feet or base points of the triangle
the parameter sets the location of the triangle peak
for instance membership function of number of words in sentence occurred in title is show in figure
figure
membership function of number of words in sentence occurred in title in inference engine the most important part in this procedure is the definition of fuzzy if then rules
the important sentences are extracted from these rules according to our features criteria
sample of if then rules shows as the following rule
is vh and if nowordintitle is vh and sentencelength is h and termfreq is h and sentencesimilarity is vh and nopropernoun is h and nothematicword is vh and numbericaldata is h then sentence is important sentenceposition likewise the last step in fuzzy logic system is the defuzzification
we used the output membership function which is divided into three membership functions output unimportant average and important to convert the fuzzy results from the inference engine into a crisp output for the final score of each sentence
c
extraction of sentences both gsm and fuzzy logic method each sentence of the document is represented by sentence score
then all document sentences are ranked in a descending order according to their scores
a set of highest score sentences are extracted as document summary based on the compression rate
therefore we extracted the appropriate number of sentences according to compression rate
it has been proven that the extraction of of sentences from the source document can be as informative as the full text of a document
finally the summary sentences are arranged in the original order
v
evaluation and results gold standard summaries we use the rouge a set of metrics called recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation evaluation toolkit that has become standards of automatic evaluation of summaries
it compares the summaries generated by the program with the human generated
for comparison it uses n gram statistics
our evaluation was done using n gram setting of rouge which was found to have the highest correlation with human judgments at a confidence level of
it is claimed that consistently correlates highly with human assessments and has high recall and precision significance test with manual evaluation results
we choose as the measurement of our experiment results
in the table we compare the average precision recall and measure score between general statistic method gsm fuzzy summarizer microsoft word summarizer and baseline summarizer form data set

conclusion and future work in this paper we have presented a fuzzy logic aided sentence extractive summarizer that can be as informative as the full text of a document with better information coverage
a prototype has also been constructed to evaluate this automatic text summarization scheme using as input some news articles collection provided by
we extracted the important features for each sentence of the document represented as the vector of features consisting of the following elements title feature sentence length term weight sentence position sentence to sentence similarity proper noun thematic word and numerical data
we have done experiments with data set comparing our summarizer with microsoft word and baseline using precision recall and measure built by rouge
the results show that the best average precision recall and measure to summaries produced by the fuzzy method
certainly the experimental result is based on fuzzy logic could improve the quality of summary results that based on the general statistic method
in conclusion we will extend the proposed method using combination of fuzzy logic and other learning methods and extract the other features could provide the sentences more important
