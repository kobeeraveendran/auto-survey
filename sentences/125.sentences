com abstract
performance appraisal pa is an important hr process to periodically measure and evaluate every employee s performance the goals established by the organization
a pa process involves poseful multi step multi modal communication between employees their supervisors and their peers such as self appraisal supervisor assessment and peer feedback
analysis of the structured data and text produced in pa is crucial for measuring the quality of appraisals and tracking actual improvements
in this paper we apply text mining techniques to produce insights from pa text
first we perform sentence tion to identify strengths weaknesses and suggestions of improvements found in the supervisor assessments and then use clustering to discover broad categories among them
next we use multi class multi label cation techniques to match supervisor assessments to predened broad perspectives on performance
finally we propose a short text rization technique to produce a summary of peer feedback comments for a given employee and compare it with manual summaries
all niques are illustrated using a real life dataset of supervisor assessment and peer feedback text produced during the pa of employees in a large multi national it company
introduction performance appraisal pa is an important hr process particularly for modern organizations that crucially depend on the skills and expertise of their workforce
the pa process enables an organization to periodically measure and evaluate every employee s performance
it also provides a mechanism to link the goals established by the organization to its each employee s day to day activities and performance
design and analysis of pa processes is a lively area of research within the hr community
the pa process in any modern organization is nowadays implemented and tracked through an it system the pa system that records the interactions that happen in various steps
availability of this data in a computer readable database opens up opportunities to analyze it using automated statistical mining and text mining techniques to generate novel and actionable insights patterns and to help in improving the quality and eectiveness of the pa
automated analysis of large scale pa data is now facilitated cess by technological and algorithmic advances and is becoming essential for large organizations containing thousands of geographically distributed employees dling a wide variety of roles and tasks
a typical pa process involves purposeful multi step multi modal tion between employees their supervisors and their peers
in most pa processes the communication includes the following steps i in self appraisal an employee records his her achievements activities tasks handled
in supervisor sessment the supervisor provides the criticism evaluation and suggestions for improvement of performance
and in peer feedback aka view the peers of the employee provide their feedback
there are several business tions that managers are interested in
examples
for my workforce what are the broad categories of strengths weaknesses and suggestions of improvements found in the supervisor assessments
for my workforce how many supervisor comments are present for each of a given xed set of perspectives which we call attributes such as tional excellence customer focus building effective teams

what is the summary of the peer feedback for a given employee in this paper we develop text mining techniques that can automatically produce answers to these questions
since the intended users are hr executives ideally the techniques should work with minimum training data and experimentation with parameter setting
these techniques have been implemented and are being used in a pa system in a large multi national it company
the rest of the paper is organized as follows
section summarizes related work
section summarizes the pa dataset used in this paper
section plies sentence classication algorithms to automatically discover three tant classes of sentences in the pa corpus viz
sentences that discuss strengths weaknesses of employees and contain suggestions for improving her performance
section considers the problem of mapping the actual targets mentioned in strengths weaknesses and suggestions to a xed set of attributes
in section we discuss how the feedback from peers for a particular employee can be marized
in section we draw conclusions and identify some further work
related work we rst review some work related to sentence classication
semantically fying sentences based on the sentence s purpose is a much harder task and is gaining increasing attention from linguists and nlp researchers
mcknight and srinivasan and yamamoto and takagi used svm to classify sentences in biomedical abstracts into classes such as introduction background pose method result conclusion
cohen et al
applied svm and other techniques to learn classiers for sentences in emails into classes which are speech acts dened by a verb noun pair with verbs such as request propose amend commit deliver and nouns such as meeting document committee see also
khoo et al
uses various classiers to classify sentences in emails into classes such as apology instruction question request salutation ment suggestion thanking
qadir and rilo proposes several lters and classiers to classify sentences on message boards community qa systems into speech acts commissive speaker commits to a future action directive speaker expects listener to take some action expressive speaker expresses his or her psychological state to the listener representative represents the speaker s belief of something
hachey and grover used svm and maximum entropy classiers to classify sentences in legal documents into classes such as fact proceedings background framing disposal see also
pande et al
proposes unsupervised linguistic patterns to classify sentences into classes suggestion complaint
there is much work on a closely related problem viz
classifying sentences in dialogues through dialogue specic categories called dialogue acts which we will not review here
just as one example cotterill classies tions in emails into the dialogue acts of yes no question wh question action request rhetorical multiple choice
we could not nd much work related to mining of performance appraisals data
pawar et al
uses kernel based classication to classify sentences in both performance appraisal text and product reviews into classes suggestion preciation complaint
apte et al
provides two algorithms for matching the descriptions of goals or tasks assigned to employees to a standard template of model goals
one algorithm is based on the co training framework and uses goal descriptions and self appraisal comments as two separate perspectives
the second approach uses semantic similarity under a weak supervision framework
ramrakhiyani et al
proposes label propagation algorithms to discover pects in supervisor assessments in performance appraisals where an aspect is modelled as a verb noun pair e

conduct training improve coding
dataset in this paper we used the supervisor assessment and peer feedback text produced during the performance appraisal of employees in a large multi national it company
the corpus of supervisor assessment has sentences
the mary statistics about the number of words in a sentence is


sentence classication the pa corpus contains several classes of sentences that are of interest
in this paper we focus on three important classes of sentences viz
sentences that discuss strengths class strength weaknesses of employees class ness and suggestions for improving her performance class suggestion
the strengths or weaknesses are mostly about the performance in work carried out but sometimes they can be about the working style or other personal strength weakness suggestion qualities
the classes weakness and suggestion are somewhat overlapping e

a suggestion may address a perceived weakness
following are two example sentences in each class
excellent technology leadership and delivery capabilities along with ability to groom technology champions within the team
he can drive team to achieve results and can take pressure
sometimes exhibits the quality that he knows more than the others in the room which puts off others
tends to stretch himself and team a bit too hard
x has to attune himself to the vision of the business unit and its goals a little more than what is being currently exhibited
need to improve on business development skills articulation of business and solution benefits
several linguistic aspects of these classes of sentences are apparent
the ject is implicit in many sentences
the strengths are often mentioned as either noun phrases np with positive adjectives excellent technology leadership or positive nouns engineering strength or through verbs with positive larity dedicated or as verb phrases containing positive adjectives delivers innovative solutions
similarly for weaknesses where negation is more quently used presentations are not his forte or alternatively the polarities of verbs avoid or adjectives poor tend to be negative
however sometimes the form of both the strengths and weaknesses is the same typically a alone sentiment neutral np making it dicult to distinguish between them

adherence to timing or timely closure
suggestions often have an imperative mood and contain secondary verbs such as need to should has to
tions are sometimes expressed using comparatives better process compliance
we built a simple set of patterns for each of the classes on the pos tagged form of the sentences
we use each set of these patterns as an unsupervised sentence classier for that class
if a particular sentence matched with patterns for multiple classes then we have simple tie breaking rules for picking the nal class
the pattern for the strength class looks for the presence of positive words phrases like takes ownership excellent hard working commitment
similarly the pattern for the weakness class looks for the presence of negative words phrases like lacking diffident slow learner less focused
the suggestion pattern not only looks for keywords like should needs to but also for pos based pattern like a verb in the base form vb in the beginning of a sentence
we randomly selected sentences from the supervisor assessment pus and manually tagged them dataset
this labelled dataset contained and sentences having the class labels strength weakness suggestion or other respectively
we trained several multi class classiers on this dataset
table shows the results of fold cross validation experiments on dataset
for the rst classiers we used their implementation from the scikit learn library in python scikit learn
org
the features used for these classiers were simply the sentence words along with their frequencies
for the last classiers in table we used our own implementation
the overall racy for a classier is dened as a correct predictions where the denominator is for dataset
note that the pattern based approach is unsupervised i
e
it did not use any training data
hence the results shown for it are for the entire dataset and not based on cross validation

comparison with sentiment analyzer we also explored whether a sentiment analyzer can be used as a baseline for identifying the class labels strength and weakness
we used an tation of sentiment analyzer from to get a polarity score for each sentence
table shows the distribution of positive negative and neutral timents across the class labels strength weakness and suggestion
it can be observed that distribution of positive and negative sentiments is almost similar in strength as well as suggestion sentences hence we can conclude that the information about sentiments is not much useful for our classication problem

discovering clusters within sentence classes after identifying sentences in each class we can now answer question in section
from sentences predicted to have label strength we extract

we repeat this for the sentences with predicted label ness or suggestion as a single class
tables and show a few tative clusters in strengths and in weaknesses respectively
we also explored clustering strength sentences directly using cluto and lingo clustering algorithms
discovered clusters and also assigned labels to these clusters
we then generated clusters using cluto as well
cluto does not generate cluster labels automatically hence we used most frequent words within the cluster as its labels
table shows the largest clusters by both the algorithms
it was observed that the clusters created by cluto were more meaningful and informative as compared to those by lingo
also it was observed that there is some correspondence between noun clusters and sentence clusters
e

the nouns cluster motivation expertise knowledge talent skill table corresponds to the cluto sentence ter skill customer management knowledge team table
but overall users found the nouns clusters to be more meaningful than the sentence clusters

each attribute covers one specic aspect of the work done by the employees
this has the advantage that we can easily compare the performance of any two employees or groups of employees along any given attribute
we can correlate various performance attributes and nd dependencies among them
we can also cluster employees in the workforce using their supervisor ratings for each attribute to discover interesting insights into the workforce
the hr managers in the organization considered in this paper have dened attributes table
each attribute is essentially a work item or work category described at an abstract level
for example functional excellence covers any tasks goals or activities related to the software engineering life cycle e

requirements analysis design coding testing
as well as technologies such as databases web services and gui
in the example in section the rst sentence which has class strength can be mapped to two attributes functional excellence and ing effective teams
similarly the third sentence which has class ness can be mapped to the attribute interpersonal effectiveness and so forth
thus in order to answer the second question in section we need to map each sentence in each of the classes to zero one two or more attributes which is a multi class multi label classication problem
we manually tagged the same sentences in dataset with attributes where each sentence may get
up to class labels this is dataset
this labelled dataset contained sentences having the class labels listed in table in the same order
the number of sentences having or more than attributes are and respectively
we trained several multi class multi label classiers on this dataset
table shows the results of fold cross validation experiments on dataset
precision recall and f measure for this multi label classication are puted using a strategy similar to the one described in
let pi be the set of table
strengths weaknesses and suggestions along performance attributes strengths weaknesses suggestions performance attributes functional excellence building effective teams interpersonal effectiveness customer focus innovation management effective communication business acumen taking ownership people development drive for results strategic capability withstanding pressure dealing with ambiguities managing vision and purpose timely decision making table
results of fold cross validation for multi class multi label classication on dataset
precision p recall r f classier logistic regression multinomial naive bayes random forest adaboost linear svm pattern based

















predicted labels and ai be the set of actual labels for the ith instance
precision and recall for this instance are computed as follows p recisioni recalli it can be observed that p recisioni would be undened if pi is empty and larly recalli would be undened when ai is empty
hence overall precision and recall are computed by averaging over all the instances except where they are undened
instance level f measure can not be computed for instances where ther precision or recall are undened
therefore overall f measure is computed using the overall precision and recall
summarization of peer feedback using ilp the pa system includes a set of peer feedback comments for each employee
to answer the third question in section we need to create a summary of all the peer feedback comments about a given employee
as an example following are the feedback comments from peers of an employee

vast knowledge on different technologies
his experience and wast knowledge mixed with his positive attitude willingness to teach and listen and his humble nature

approachable knowlegeable and is of helping nature

dedication technical expertise and always supportive
effective communication and team player the individual sentences in the comments written by each peer are rst identied and then pos tags are assigned to each sentence
we hypothesize that a good summary of these multiple comments can be constructed by identifying a set of important text fragments or phrases
initially a set of candidate phrases is extracted from these comments and a subset of these candidate phrases is chosen as the nal summary using integer linear programming ilp
the details of the ilp formulation are shown in table
as an example following is the summary generated for the above peer comments
humble nature effective communication technical expertise always supportive vast knowledge following rules are used to identify candidate phrases an adjective followed by in which is followed by a noun phrase e

good in customer relationship a verb followed by a noun phrase e

maintains work life balance a verb followed by a preposition which is followed by a noun phrase e

engage in discussion only a noun phrase e

excellent listener only an adjective e

supportive various parameters are used to evaluate a candidate phrase for its importance
a candidate phrase is more important if it contains an adjective or a verb or its headword is a noun having wordnet lexical category noun
attribute e

nouns such as dedication sincerity if it contains more number of words if it is included in comments of multiple peers if it represents any of the performance attributes such as innovation tomer strategy
a complete list of parameters is described in detail in table
there is a trivial constraint which makes sure that only k out of n date phrases are chosen
a suitable value of k is used for each employee ing on number of candidate phrases identied across all peers see algorithm
another set of constraints to make sure that at least one phrase is selected for each of the leadership attributes
the constraint makes sure that multiple phrases sharing the same headword are not chosen at a time
also single word candidate phrases are chosen only if they are adjectives or nouns with lexical category noun
attribute
this is imposed by the constraint
it is important to note that all the constraints except are soft constraints i
e
there may be feasible solutions which do not satisfy some of these constraints
but each constraint which is not satised results in a penalty through the use of slack variables
these constraints are described in detail in table
the objective function maximizes the total importance score of the selected candidate phrases
at the same time it also minimizes the sum of all slack variables so that the minimum number of constraints are broken

k getn oof p hrasest n
end if k and n then else if k then else if k then k k k end algorithm getn p hrasest oselect for determining number of phrases to select to include in summary
evaluation of auto generated summaries we considered a dataset of employees where for each employee multiple peer comments were recorded
also for each employee a manual summary was generated by an hr personnel
the summaries generated by our ilp based approach were compared with the corresponding manual summaries using the rouge unigram score
for comparing performance of our ilp based marization algorithm we explored a few summarization algorithms provided by the sumy
a common parameter which is required by all these
com miso belica sumy table
integer linear program ilp formulation parameters n no

attribute invalidsinglen oun array of size n invalidsinglen ouni if the ith phrase is single word phrase which is neither an adjective nor a noun having lexical category wordnet noun
attribute leadership t eam innovation communication knowledge delivery ownership customer strategy p ersonal indicator arrays of size n each representing whether any phrase corresponds to a particular performance attribute e

attribute algorithms is number of sentences keep in the nal summary
ilp based rization requires a similar parameter k which is automatically decided based on number of total candidate phrases
assuming a sentence is equivalent to roughly phrases for sumy algorithms we set number of sentences parameter to the ceiling of
table shows average and standard deviation of rouge igram scores for each algorithm over the summaries
the performance of ilp based summarization is comparable with the other algorithms as the two sample t test does not show statistically signicant dierence
also human evaluators preferred phrase based summary generated by our approach to the other sentence based summaries

ilp based summary




conclusions and further work in this paper we presented an analysis of the text generated in performance appraisal pa process in a large multi national it company
we performed sentence classication to identify strengths weaknesses and suggestions for provements found in the supervisor assessments and then used clustering to discover broad categories among them
as this is non topical classication we found that svm with adws kernel produced the best results
we also used multi class multi label classication techniques to match supervisor assessments to predened broad perspectives on performance
logistic regression classier was observed to produce the best results for this topical classication
finally we proposed an ilp based summarization technique to produce a summary of peer feedback comments for a given employee and compared it with manual summaries
the pa process also generates much structured data such as supervisor ratings
it is an interesting problem to compare and combine the insights from discovered from structured data and unstructured text
also we are planning to automatically discover any additional performance attributes to the list of attributes currently used by hr
