v i x r a abstract the impression section of a radiology report summarizes crucial radiology ndings in ural language and plays a central role in municating these ndings to physicians

ever the process of generating impressions by summarizing ndings is time consuming for radiologists and prone to errors
we propose to automate the generation of radiology
sions with neural sequence to sequence ing
we further propose a customized neural model for this task which learns to encode the study background information and use this formation to guide the decoding process
on a large dataset of radiology reports collected from actual hospital studies our model forms existing non neural and neural baselines under the rouge metrics
in a blind iment a board certied radiologist indicated that of sampled system summaries are at least as good as the corresponding written summaries suggesting signicant ical validity
to our knowledge our work resents the rst attempt in this direction
introduction
the radiology report documents and cates crucial ndings in a radiology study
as shown in figure a standard radiology report usually consists of a background section that scribes the exam and patient information a ings section and an impression section kahn jr et al
in a typical workow a radiologist rst dictates the detailed ndings into the report and then summarizes the salient ndings into the more concise impression section based also on the condition of the patient

the impressions are the most signicant part of a radiology report that communicate the ings
previous studies have shown that over of referring physicians read only the impression statements in a report lafortune et al background history swelling pain

the human written summary or impression and predicted summaries from different models are also shown
the extractive baseline does not summarize well the baseline pointer generator model generates spurious sequence while our model gives correct mary by incorporating the background information

bosmans al
despite its importance the generation of the impression statements is prone
for example crucial ndings may be
gotten which would cause signicant nications gershanik al
additionally the process of writing the impression statements is time consuming and highly repetitive with the tation of the ndings
this suggests a crucial need to automate the radiology impression generation process

in this work we propose to automate the generation of radiology impressions with neural sequence to sequence learning
in particular we argue that this task could be viewed as a text marization problem where the source sequence is the radiology ndings and the target sequence the impression statements
we collect a dataset of diology reports from actual hospital radiographic studies and nd that this task involves both tractive summarization where descriptions of diology observations can be taken directly from the ndings and abstractive summarization where new words and phrases such as conclusions of the study need to be generated from scratch
we empirically evaluate existing popular tion systems on this task and nd that while
isting neural models such as the pointer generater network can generate plausible summaries they sometimes fail to model the study background formation and thus generate spurious results
to solve this problem we propose a customized marization model that properly encodes the study background information and uses the encoded formation to guide the decoding process
we show that our model outperforms existing non neural and neural baselines on our dataset measured by the standard rouge metrics
over in a blind experiment a board certied ologist indicated that of sampled system maries are at least as good as the reference maries written by well trained radiologists gesting signicant clinical validity of the resulting system
we further show through detailed sis that our model could be reliably transferred to radiology reports from another organization and that the model can sometimes summarize ogy studies for body parts unseen during training

to review our main contributions in this paper include we propose to summarize radiology ndings into impression statements with neural sequence to sequence learning and to our edge our work represents the rst attempt in this direction we propose a new customized marization model to this task that improves over existing methods by better leveraging study ground information we further show via a diologist evaluation that the summaries generated by our model have signicant clinical validity
related work early summarization systems
early work on summarization systems mainly focused on tive approaches where the summaries are ated by scoring and selecting sentences from the input
luhn proposed to represent the put by topic words and score each sentence by the amount of topic words it contains
kupiec et al
scored sentences with a feature based tistical classier
steinberger and jezek plied latent semantic analysis to cluster the ics and then select sentences that cover the most topics
meanwhile various graph based methods such as the lexrank mihalcea and tarau and the textrank algorithm erkan and radev were applied to model sentence dency by representing sentences as vertices and similarities as edges
sentences are then scored and selected via modeling of the graph properties
neural summarization systems
tion systems based on neural network models able abstractive summarization where new words and phrases are generated to form the summaries

rush et al
rst applied an attention based neural encoder and a neural language model
coder to this task
nallapati al
used current neural networks for both the encoder and the decoder
to address the limitation that neural models with a xed vocabulary can not handle of vocabulary words a pointer generator model was proposed which uses an attention mechanism that copies elements directly from the input lapati et al merity et al see et al
see et al
further proposed a age mechanism to address the repetition problem in the generated summaries
paulus et al
applied reinforcement learning to summarization and more recently chen and bansal tained improved result with a model
that rst lects sentences
and then rewrites them
summarization of radiology reports
most prior work that attempts to summarize
ogy reports focused on classifying and extracting information from the report text friedman et al hripcsak et al elkins et al hripcsak et al
more recently hassanpour and langlotz studied extracting named tities from multi institutional radiology reports ing traditional feature based classiers
goff and loehfelm built an nlp pipeline to identify asserted and negated disease entities in the sion section of radiology reports as a step towards report summarization
cornegruta et al
proposed to use a recurrent neural network tecture to model radiological language in solving the medical named entity recognition and tion detection tasks on radiology reports
to our knowledge our work represents the rst attempt
neural sequence to sequence model where v and v are learnable parameters
at automatic summarization of radiology ndings into natural language impression statements
task denition
we now give a formal denition of the task of summarizing radiology ndings
given a passage of ndings represented as a sequence of tokens
xn with n being the length of the ndings our goal is to nd a sequence of tokens
yl that best summarizes the salient and clinically signicant ndings in x with l being an arbitrary length of the
note that the mapping between and y can either be modeled in an unsupervised way as done in supervised summarization systems or be learned from a dataset of ndings summary pairs
models in this section we introduce our model for the task of summarizing radiology ndings
as our model builds on top of existing work on ral sequence to sequence learning and the generator model we start by introducing them

at a high level our model implements the marization task with an encoder decoder ture where the encoder learns hidden state sentations of the input and the decoder decodes the input representations into an output sequence
for the encoder we use a bi directional long short term memory bi lstm network
given
the ndings sequence
xn we encode into hidden state vectors with
bi where h

hn
here hn combines the last hidden states from both directions in the encoder
after the entire input sequence is encoded we generate the output sequence step by step with a separate lstm decoder
formally at the t th step given the previously generated token and the previous decoder state the decoder calculates the current state st with st

we then use st to predict the output word
for the initial decoder state we set hn
the name impression is often used in clinical tings we use summary and impression interchangably

the vanilla sequence to sequence model that uses only st to predict the output word has a major limitation it generates the entire output sequence based solely on a vector representation of the put hn which may result in signicant formation loss
for better decoding we therefore employ the attention mechanism bahdanau et al luong et al which uses a weighted sum of all input states at every decoding step

given the decoder state st and an input hidden state hi we calculate an input distribution at as wsst et at where wh ws and v are learnable
we then calculate a weighted input vector as h t at ihi
i
h t
encodes the salient input information that is useful at decoding step lastly we obtain the output vocabulary distribution at step t as p y t

st h pointer generator network
while the encoder decoder framework described above can generate impressions from a xed cabulary the model can clearly benet from being able to copy salient observations directly from the input ndings
to add such copying capacity into the model we use a pointer generator network similar to the one described in see et al

the main idea is that at each decoding step t we allow the model to either generate a word from the vocabulary with a generation probability pgen or copy a word directly from the input sequence with probability pgen
we model pgen as pgen hh t s st where denotes the previous decoder output wh ws and wy learnable parameters and a sigmoid function
for the copy distribution we reuse the attention distribution at calculated in

therefore the overall output distribution in the pointer generator network is p y at i i xi clarity we leave out the bias terms in all linear layers
figure overall architecture of our summarization model
where is the same as the output bution in

incorporating study background
information the background part of a radiology report is also important since crucial information such as the purpose of the study the body part involved and the condition of the patient are often mentioned only in the background
a straightforward way of incorporating the background information is to prepend all the background text to the ings and treat the entire sequence as input to the pointer generator network
however as we show in section this naive method in fact hurts the summarization quality presumably because the model can not sufciently distinguish between the ndings and the background information which as a result leads to insufcient modeling of both the ndings and the background
to solve this we propose to encode the background text with a separate attentional encoder and use the resulting background representation to guide the decoding process in the summarization model figure

for clarity we now use xb to denote the ground token sequence and to denote the actual ndings section
our goal is then to nd y that maximizes p
to do this we again
tain the hidden state vectors h of the ndings tion as in
similarly we obtain the hidden state vectors of the background text with xb as input ing a separate bi lstm encoder hb
bi

next we calculate a distribution over hb as


i whhn where wb and wh are learnable parameters and
hn the last hidden state of the ndings encoder

the distribution models the importance of kens in the background section
we then obtain a weighted representation of the background text as ihb

i i where vector b has the same size as hb and codes the salient background information

lastly we use the background vector b to guide the decoding process by modifying the recurrent kernel of the decoder lstm in to be

it ft ot
ut tanh
w
b ct it ut st ot where it ft ot denotes the input forget and put gates w the weight matrix and ct the nal cell of the lstm repectively and represents an element wise multiplication
again for clarity we leave out the bias terms in
as a result every state in the decoding process is directly uenced by the information encoded by the ground vector

the calculation of the vocabulary distribution and the copy distribution remains the same
experiments to test the effectiveness of our summarization model we collected reports of radiographic ies from the picture
archiving and communication system pacs at the stanford hospital
we scribe our data collection process baseline models and experimental setup in this section and present the results and discussions in section
data collection reports of all radiographic studies from to were collected
we rst tokenized all reports with stanford corenlp manning al and ltered the dataset by excluding reports where no ndings or impression section can be found multiple ndings or impression sections can be found but can not be aligned or
the ndings have fewer than words or the impression has fewer than words
we removed body parts where only a small number of cases are available and included ports of the top body parts in the pacs system to maintain generalizability
for common body parts with more than reports chest we subsampled reports from them

this results in a dataset with a total of reports
we further randomly split the dataset into a training a development and a test set
we show the dataset statistics split by body part in figure baseline models for our main experiments we compare our model against several competitive non neural and neural systems on the collected dataset
unless otherwise stated the baseline models take only the ndings section as lsa
this is an extractive approach scribed by steinberger and jezek which applies latent semantic analysis lsa to marization
it rst scores concept clusters by
plying singular value decomposition to the by sentence co occurence matrix derived from the passage
sentences with the top scored concepts are then kept as the summaries
lexrank
lexrank is another popular tive model introduced by erkan and radev

in lexrank a passage is represented as a graph of sentences and a connectivity matrix based on intra sentence cosine similarity is used as the jacency matrix of the graph
sentences are scored by the eigenvector centrality in the graph and the highest scored sentences are kept
pointer generator
we also run the baseline pointer generator model introduced by see et al

we nd the coverage mechanism scribed in the paper did not improve summary quality in our task and therefore did not use it for simplicity
we compare our model with two versions of the pointer generator model one with only the ndings section as input and another one with the background sections prepended to the ndings section as input
experimental setup evaluation metrics

in our main experiments we evaluate the models with the widely used rouge metric lin
we report the scores for and rouge l which measure the word level unigram overlap bigram overlap and the longest common sequence between the reference summary and the system predicted summary respectively
word vectors
to enable knowledge transfer from a larger corpus we applied the glove
rithm pennington et al to a corpus of million radiology reports of all modalities x ray ct and body parts
we used the ing dimensional word vectors to initialize all word embedding layers in our neural models and empirically found this to improve the performance of our neural models by about rouge l score
nd
that when the background section is prepended to the input the extractive baseline models may select tences in the background part as the summary resulting in deteriorated performance
system rouge l extractive baseline lsa extractive baseline lexrank pointer generator pointer generator background
our model table main results on the test set of the stanford reports
background represents prepending the background section to the ndings section to form the input to the model
all the rouge scores have a condence interval of at most as calculated by the ofcial rouge script
implementations model details
for the two non neural extractive baselines we use their open
for both of them we select the top n scored sentences to form the summary and treat n as a hyperparameter
we use n in our experiments as it yields best scores on the dev set
we implemented all neural models with to train the neural models we append a special eos token to the end of every erence summary
we then employ the standard teacher forcing with the reference summaries and optimize the negative log likelihood loss using the adam optimizer kingma and ba
we tune all hyperparameters on the dev set
we use layer
bi lstm for all encoders and set the hidden size to be for each direction layer lstm for the decoder and set the hidden size to be
during inference we employ the standard beam search with a beam size of
we stop decoding

ever a eos token is predicted and otherwise use a maximum output sequence length of results analysis main results we present results of our main experiments in table
we nd that the two non neural
tractive models perform comparably and both are able to obtain non trivial subsequence
lap with the reference summaries as measured by rouge scores
however a baseline neural pointer generator that combines the sequence eration and the copy mechanism beats the neural baselines substantially on all metrics
we conrm that naively incorporating the study ground information by prepending the background section directly to the input ndings in the generator model in fact hurts the performance noted by background

in comparison our model benets from using the separately encoded background vector to guide the decoding process and achieves best scores on all rouge metrics
we also present sampled test examples and tem output in figure
we nd that compared to the non neural extractive baselines the neural models are not limited by sentences in the ndings section and therefore generate summaries of ter quality
for example the neural models learn to compose the summary by combining tion phrases from different sentences or by erating new conclusive phrases such as negative study
compared to the pointer generator model our model learns to correctly utilize relevant ground information previous study or exam information to improve the summary
clinical validity with radiologist evaluation one potential shortcoming of the rouge rics is that they only measure the similarity
tween the predicted summary and the reference summary but do not sufciently reect the overall grammaticality or utility of the predictions

fore we also conducted evaluations with a certied radiologist to understand the clinical lidity of our system generated summaries
in this evaluation we randomly sampled examples from our test set
we ran our best model over these examples and presented each example along with the corresponding tem predicted summary and reference written summary to the radiologist
we randomly ordered the predicted and reference summary such that the correspondence can not be guessed from the order
the radiologist was asked to select which of the two summaries was better or that
they have roughly equal quality

lexrank
our model table cross organization evaluation results on the indiana university chest ray dataset
all the rouge scores have a condence interval of at most as calculated by the ofcial rouge script
radiologist indicated that the human written and system generated summaries are equivalent
for examples the radiologist preferred the system summary and for the remaining examples the radiologist preferred the human written summary

note that under our setting a randomly generated sequence would have almost zero chance to be dicated as good as the human written summary

we therefore believe the result suggests signicant clinical validity of our system

does the model transfer to reports from another organization
deploying a clinical nlp system at an tion different from the one where the training data comes from is a common need
however this is challenging in that medical practitioners ing radiologists from different organizations tend to go through different training and follow ent templates or styles when writing medical text

here we aim to understand the cross organization transferability of our summarization model
we use the publicly available indiana
versity chest x ray dataset demner fushman et al which consists of chest x ray images paired with the corresponding radiology reports

we ltered the reports with the same set of rules and arrived at a collection of unique reports

we used this dataset as the test set and ran our best model trained on our own dataset directly on it

the results are shown in table and sampled amples are shown in the rst two columns of
ure
we nd that our model again outperforms the baseline extractive model substantially in this transfer setting and the generated summaries are both grammatical and clinically meaningful

does the model transfer to body parts unseen during training
radiology studies conducted on different body
parts often include vastly different observations and diagnosis
for example while lung base opacity is a common observation in chest graphic studies it does not exist in tal studies
in practice an organization may not have adequate report data that covers some rare body parts
it is therefore interesting to test to what extent our summarization model can generalize to reports for body parts unseen during training
we study this by simulating the condition where a specic body part is not present in the ing data
given the entire dataset d and a set of the dataset db that corresponds to a body part b we reserved the entire subset db as test data and used d db for training and validation
table presents the tion results for body part chest abdomen and knee
we nd that for chest and abdomen the system summaries degrade substantially when the corresponding data were not seen during ing
however the predicted summaries degrade good summary missing critical info

inaccurate spurious info

redundant ungrammatical table error analysis on sampled dev examples from the stanford dataset
less for knee when reports of it were not seen during training presumably because the model can learn to summarize reasonably well from ports of other close musculoskeletal studies such as ankle or elbow studies
we conrm this by examining the model predictions in the example shown in the last column of figure the model
learns to compose the summary with salient vations such as tissue swelling and fracture while being able to copy the anatomy knee seen during training from the ndings section

what is the model missing on
lastly we run a detailed error analysis on sampled dev examples
we focus on four types of errors missing critical information if the predicted summary fails to include some clinically important information inaccuate spurious formation if the predicted summary contains servations or conclusions that are inaccurate or that do not exist in the ndings redundant summary if the predicted summary is repetitive or over verbose and ungrammatical summary if the predicted summary contains signicant error type missing critical information error type redundant summary error type ungrammatical summary background radiographic examination of the lumbar spine time

figure examples of different types of errors that our system makes on the standord dataset
words that are missing from or are erroneously included in the model predictions are highlighted in red
matical errors
for each example we examine whether it contains any of the errors by comparing it with the reference summary otherwise we
sify it as a good summary
note that an example can be assigned to more than one error categories

we include examples of different error types in figure and present the result of error analysis in table
we nd that examples are itatively close to the reference summary which aligns well with the radiologist evaluation result

among the four error categories missing critical information is the most common error with examples suggesting that the summaries may be improved with explicit modeling of the tance of different radiology ndings
we also nd through qualitative analysis that the model tends to miss on followup procedures recommended by the human radiologist since these procedures are
ten not included in the ndings section and ating them needs signicant understanding of the study and domain knowledge
conclusion
in this paper we proposed to generate radiology impressions from ndings via neural sequence sequence learning
we proposed a customized neural model for this task which uses encoded background information to guide the decoding process
we collected a dataset from actual pital studies and showed that our model not only outperforms non neural and neural baselines but also generates summaries with signicant clinical validity and cross organization transferability
